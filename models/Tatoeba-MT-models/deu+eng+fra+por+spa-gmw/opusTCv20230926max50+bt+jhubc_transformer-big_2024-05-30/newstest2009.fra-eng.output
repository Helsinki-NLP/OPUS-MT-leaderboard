At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange tipped into the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange recovered its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ stocks reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchange, the Prague Stock Exchange rebounded with its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan for the U.S. financial sector, is thus also perceptible here.
Stocks fall in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic decline on Tuesday, even though the indices succeeded, over the course of the day, to erase some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng Index lost four percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately we managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"Hesitation about the U.S. bailout will affect financial markets around the world," noted Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries would be affected.
The bloodbath of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the proposed financial system support, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly K<0xC4><0x8D> 12 billion).
Legislators thus denied the call for support for President George Bush's bill.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath and major stock indices saw the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost nearly seven percent, having last seen a fall of such magnitude in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it became apparent that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gives way: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a turning point in talks over the adoption of a bailout in the form of $700 billion in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed Monday in the House of Representatives.
Barney Frank, the chairman of the House’s banking and financial regulation committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout will be adopted should be a major first psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, a "disillusionment" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the shape of the market stabilization package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be held as early as Sunday.
On Saturday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It is expected to buy back from financial companies the unsellable real estate assets that cause financial firms to suffer considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to pursue this market recovery plan, but I think we are," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling stock markets.
According to the Democratic senator did escape Harry Reid, the lawmakers are making sure that Congress comes to a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors ahead of the start of trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the congressional decision could influence Monday’s trading.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will vote, nor whether the negotiations are likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by this or that problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount allocated to the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress will feel that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility to block the granting of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put it in the minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated “the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of Golden Parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chair Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, says legislators have agreed on responsibility for the financial program, protection of contributors from losses, the rebate agreement, and the timeline of the plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for property owners, who are having problems paying.
The government should negotiate new instalments in the case of mortgages it is going to redeem, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to achieve.
“And that’s because we don’t know what the mechanism and the price of the problem asset buyback will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the splitting of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is not, according to Marek, so important.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree, starting this week, that they support this plan and that we dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which envisages the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek said.
A struggle pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
However, there is sufficient reason to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy an expensive high-end gramophone for the house to put on the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are stacked vinyl records in your shelves, with art rock, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same goes for music while on the move, namely compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would struggle to support headphones bought for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of the batteries is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are features unknown, of course, to most mobile phones.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and texting, it is able to play music and movies, record the latter, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing practically a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The more features you use, the shorter the interval between two reloads.
And playing music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) perform significantly better.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is valid even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of recharging, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be connected directly to the computer, without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobile phones.
As far as drives are concerned, you do not need, except for iPod, any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library themselves, classified by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or by the judgement of the user.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
When choosing a specific device, focus on the battery life, memory capacity, sound quality and output type and, of course, ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3s.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of this today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone can play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), meanwhile, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Just visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator's web pages (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to purchase a musical mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to fast-made radio tubes.
The prices are not the lowest either.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, the internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people still carry their motives on themselves.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the phone out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which have practically all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three to four thousand crowns, you can have an already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the lack of output for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best equipped, also provided with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having easy control.
Really anyone manages to ensure the control of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (the M2 type, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive do it even with 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and thus the ease of the control is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a longer battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher here than in the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly said that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently no longer very lucky (in fact, now it would be difficult to find frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which the traditional operators also had to react.
Yet, even before party troubles such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those we hear today were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to win over 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind the Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which among other things owns the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for them to operate efficiently, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
This is how virtual operators around the world are profiling themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work also in our home.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of corporate customers, has not hidden, for a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations,” said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“Right now, we don’t think there’s room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," mentioned Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators are also concerned with the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
“It is practically excluded that a virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time frame, we should have a concrete agreement now.”
Instead, Vodafone is focusing its attention on fulfilling requests to get its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared fees and infrastructure.
This is what, in our view, means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to set up a common network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of the mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
So what is the point of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to get along like thieves at a fair. The chicane that accompanied the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by information available to the public from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
Nowadays, U:fon lends itself to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová remarked on this: "Mobile market competition has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems bewildering.
However, it is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, because the offer of potential stakeholders did not a priori present enough interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS's Department of External Relations in response to our question.
A declaration made in this way would not be surprising on the part of operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a lower price of mobile telephone services."
However, pushing for an honest functioning of the market and lowering prices is apparently not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a gasoline price strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore no one has a corresponding increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in its statement.
One of the many points of disagreement is the interpretation of the dominant position in the market.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitutes a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators visibly proceed in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Putting responsibility back on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common turn in communications, through which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to pass through the recent enactment of the Telecommunications Act an expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS must know this very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work.
That said, the operation of a kind of pseudo-virtual operators, several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile phone services, but these are only partly public.
In most cases, there are companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company makes in front of the operator figure of a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special (and other) price offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are talking about were to happen, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we are examining and that could result in a stoppage of the collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity did not reach even those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, opposes such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators.
But that is precisely what should seem strange to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question arises at UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in practically all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators tried sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, if not too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies intervened in the developed countries, which defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they ended up creating a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are treating this issue in the manner of a hot potato that is discarded by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the handle after the axe.
If the behind-the-scenes information tells the truth and a virtual operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may get back in motion.
If one of the operators has agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain impassive in the face of rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choir performance and an instrumental version.
The vocals are performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of solo versions singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that we understand the lyrics, which they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j echoed for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kerms of Savetiers), an original Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date when the first passengers will get on the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it both registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Ra<0xC5><0x9B>lis, And<0xC4><0x9B>l.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons by internet on the web pages of the Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitely forget about the counters in the subway stations, where they had to hitherto trample with impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and it will be saved on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these points of contact, there is at the disposal of passengers a ticket office with trained staff, who will help those interested with the purchase by internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they bought on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, it will also be possible to register the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, reminiscent of the ticket composting machines and passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The e-coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city.
Namely in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the tickets Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of transports in Prague commun.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver’s cash register.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the place indicated on the side of the checkout.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the peri-urban buses and do not remember the expiry date of their coupon, can rejoin the vending machines, originally used to register the coupons on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudetenland is calling for a referendum in the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans demanded that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter filed in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This is the result of a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now stored in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>eská v<0xC4><0x9B>decká knihovna.
Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov in the letter asked the US president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavská <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (region of forests south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We understand the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People who care about the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava," reads.
Since the rally with Czechoslovakia is supposedly only promising - knowing the Czech national character - of brutality, disrespectful attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava for now and forever.
“We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a state that is foreign to us, that oppresses and destroys minorities and that has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants,” the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the “Czech oppressors”.
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine if its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to foresee that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek's office believes it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You do not think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can commonly see images with drastic images of the victims of the accidents.
It believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The sugar and whip strategy against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded to the drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
In his view, the warning signs for drivers are already less efficient.
"When a static sign that warns of a hazard is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, called for the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made the statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without that, peace will not be made," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens wounded.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" located inside the Old City.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said later.
Retirement from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was a prerequisite for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
“I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan retreat,” he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to terrorism by Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long-distance coach is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If you want to comply with the law in a strict and formal way, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, in which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the way to the bus.
The girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this stand-up equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The Student Agency long-distance coaches do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the ministry and, in the beginning, it forbids any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got passengers to go to the toilet during the trip as long as they have their own seat,” he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription takes care of that role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport only knows the term "vehicle receiver"; it does not define its rights and duties," spokesman Hanzelka adds with more ambiguity.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the Road Traffic Department, believes that the law adequately addresses the problem.
“It all depends on whether the coach has in its homologation the permission to offer standing seats.
It’s all in there,” he said.
The coaches are divided into urban, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, intercity with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long distance coaches without standing place with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) on safety in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in airplanes.
There, too, it is not sure when turbulence will occur and the air hostess may hit her head."
“Now, in the event that the coach braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards through internal requirements," he said, adding that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach company to offer steward services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession as a risky profession.
"However, as soon as I feel that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The concern for safety is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we have opposed them from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has happened
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop strip without using a blinker and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter trying to avoid him by means of a sudden maneuver, but he scoured him from his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been in the process of being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarification on the travel of stewards on board the bus.
"Now, it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelka, adding that the control of the safety of coaches is under the control of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfers are based on Frankfurt.
There was no shortage of great words in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
A merger of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank could create the "central financial market institution of the financial group of the Sparkasse", according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "skills pool" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive start to further concentrations in the Länder's banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is still under heavy pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Authority that, only recently, made it clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was running out in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been talk for some time already - also on the Frankfurt side - of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, which knows the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made it clear at the presentation of the figures for the semester at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the groups of savings banks, has instructed the steering committee to conduct talks with WestLB with a view to joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, has one of the largest employers in the Frankfurt financial centre, comes into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate State Bank and the Halbab.
However, nothing emerged from this ternary bouquet.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the government of the Land of Hesse had decided against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
The other two houses did not meet either.
The Bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Lastly, however, Günther Merl, chairman of Hellaba's board of directors, had spoken out against any commercial strategy of merging with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the regrouping of the various public sector establishments is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Baden-Wuttenberg State Bank could come to fruition in the first place.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, the potential partners are gradually escaping.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has hitherto withstood the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings and transfers group, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, on the other hand, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain to the rigour.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl declared that the decisive question, by means of which business model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be ensured, had not until then been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfers.
In the long run, a dismemberment of the WestLb could take place, dismemberment which is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter of the incumbent Steering Committee: in any case, a "comprehensive solution" for the establishment would be sought.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, almost a five-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built bearded that shows to about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds his mouth can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure this evening at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel Brazilians exclusively.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing from then and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with faux fur and wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they have been going to the beer festival, already three laps this year alone.
They go there at night, stay at the party during the day, and return at 10:30 p.m.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome jar with a Kaiser beer, brewed according to Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a German speaking group manager - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses run in the night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Soon everything gets quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
It's better that way, they'll still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Brixen, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates are again taking a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at 6:30 a.m. as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds one final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, dress up with the little yellow cap.
Above it is written on the left <0x60>Fête de la béer', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Secondly: ‘When the doors of the beer tent open, we run,’ cries Marco in the early morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the back of the tent.
<0x60>Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The cup, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instruction!
<0x60>Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Thirdly: <0x60>Tonight, be back here at ten and a half o'clock!' Understood?
And that's it, we're off to the beer party.
Along the way, someone ties yellow hats to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'Italian weekend'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 going through the Alps and collapsing in the beer booth, 10 percent of visitors would have come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross which performs a statistic on the countries where Italians occupy the first place ahead of British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Finance Minister insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician used the word "relatively" and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, gets a credit of one billion from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to a sum of 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public-law banks.
In the background, it is the daughter company Depfa that bears the losses.
The state financier, according to a newspaper article, had refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has not been possible since due to mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced by 95 percent to €2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Ongoing profits and net profits from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the same period the previous year, earnings from the attribution of defined debt and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only thanks to the significant profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the Konzern companies that the profit deficit of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially misspeculated on real estate industrial loans, which had subsequently been affiliated with Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa was then more intensively engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of private-public-state (PPP) and internationally diversified projects.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group’s gains and losses, which remains somewhat unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
Already by 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other refinancing-dependent institutions in the inter-bank market since it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again considerably dried up, with the banks having accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term means of refinancing for a portion of Depfa’s total credits annually – around €50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing need is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of business at the moment.
Other sources say the refinancing would be secured through the funds until the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Board of Directors, Georg Funke, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to use the financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Surveillance (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now assured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have nothing to hope for.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest releases, still at the doors of insolvency Sunday evening, this rescue, to say the least, will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are doing particularly well.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are declining.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and those of course that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of Hypo Real Estate Bank once appeared to be an alternative speculation investment, henceforth their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that brought the crisis into the establishment by the buyout of Depfa Bank.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrears will be reduced over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope for right now – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed rumors of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching security has now become a mere, well-founded hope.
This should set aside sleepless nights primarily for long-term creditors on deciding whether to break away from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they pulled a line on to form a deferral of losses for the next few years on the next capital income tax automatically levied on stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to show up for the first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already on the way to school I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The start of the courses does not seem to be as strict as in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock minus twenty, a round of tables begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don’t like talking in front of people at all, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I did not have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low Masses, puffed with laughter and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted by the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, little sausages, a cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea exactly what I am eating here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the candied salted plums, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to get to know the boy a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I wonder if I could see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading manga is what I have preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture that is there, at one point I also started to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have sensations too.
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have sensations.
But how could we verify that he feels the same thing when he behaves the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hard-to-practice terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of brain structure make transposing our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the prefrontal lateral cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At the very least, therefore, for those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity might lie in the linguistic nature of Man: much of his existence being related to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed based on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is next to it another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of the visualization.
But what does that mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the localized defense system in the brain (or its aftermath, such as the body's reactions) takes over from vivid memory.
Thus observed, the emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volatile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities arise in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could be quite involved in transversal sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that this is indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in men and in rats is likely to be felt as such in both cases: how could one yet check whether rats and men feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees danger, but if it feels fear?
In my opinion, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Admittedly, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, while cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem causing the sensations?
And even if we could prove it for humans: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress on the nerve plane in that the same thing is measured in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
This could be judged as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am indeed an emotionally pragmatic.
UEFA President Platini: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We must work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian League President Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is always watching us."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
"We assured the UEFA President in a letter that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the Premier League were already convicted in the previous season for manipulating mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League even had to be postponed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her private life in an interview – and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulter Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attackes.
A Late Rose War for Former Couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - to everyone's eye and ears.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage’s failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his characterization as an unfaithful husband was clear: it would be "Monstrous," he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that "Meg is once again tampering with the history of our relationship and manipulating it."
It would also be "unfortunate" if "the pain and upheaval of a divorce for every child were revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack.
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the blow: "At any rate, my life goes on.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is doing the best.”
Airline and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial services and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found, after a price increase in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel prices have risen for years, hotel nights have already shrunk in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a "declining travel envy of American tourists."
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by falling hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stood at a 26.3 percent rise, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was on the rise in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy-class passengers have had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which are highly fuel-consuming, have even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, both in business class and first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to the study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, weakening economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would yield ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the "Open Skies" treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the elimination by airlines of unprofitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV beat Gladbach 1-0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late in the game and his lifted shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the locker room, half-time was over and most of them had sat down in their place.
Rieger was for almost three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that's why his request was received in the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with that second goal!
The implementation has failed.
"It wasn't all very beautiful to see today," confessed Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would also have wanted to be more relaxed.
This 1-0 (1-0 in the half), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful headstroke by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not harm the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty win,” said Marin Jol.
SV Hamburg will celebrate its 121th birthday on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional leaderboards on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-committed arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern - is certainly forming slowly, but it does not shine yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear is circulating.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a bit.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market index was 10,579 points with a decline of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock market index was at 1548 points with a decline of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that date American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett joined the company.
As part of the bailout, resources must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the amount should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that may be traded in line with price developments in order to reduce the burden on the public treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the vortex in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not alleviate the concerns of investors.
The stock price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is collapsing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The stock of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three quarters of its value at the time despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank saw a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped sharply below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared the US government’s $700 billion bailout might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also saw only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 percent for the time being, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s top Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after rising 1.26 percent from the start.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell following the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon frozen fuel conduits, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, through which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has astonished researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable laws of gravitation.
There are also irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is to say, it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter would still make up a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their abductors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the crosshairs of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported jointly by Egyptian state television, Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are doing well and are safe, Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers were reportedly close to ending the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting station.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the officer said.
All that was left was to collect the hostages, when suddenly "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers shot down six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the story.
Abuse of a father-in-law "which led to suicide"
A court has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent conduct.
Truro's High Court ruled that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession, “I feel responsible for his death.”
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, an assiduous National Trust volunteer, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had recounted that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 “emotionally dead,” and had “lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the father-in-law of his daughter who had also written a letter of confession ending with the words: "I tied her up and bandaged her regularly."
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, “You’re really weird as a fetishist, your victim certainly had to be terrorized, especially at the age of seven.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn’t done that, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The Department of Defense man was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would have remained within the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the act, that is to say of the clause that deals with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Secret Service Associate Committee.
The documents he lost contained appreciations for Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that raise money from savers, including 59 building companies.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's irritating to see that institutions that have been cautious now have to pay some of the institution's bills that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount in proportion to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to settle first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, managing director of the trade committee of the building companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have been cautious in the recovery of the real estate market now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at every aspect of this case over the coming weeks, to assess options to avoid building companies and their members paying this salty bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could double.
Since building companies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill either with higher charges, or with lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases by up to five penny per liter
The people of Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy said it would increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five cents per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of research by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they will in turn raise the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed, in 2002.
Former PM from Bangladesh refused bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for bail to former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is in danger of being arrested on his return home.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because of her indictment for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of the many accusations made to him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, has demanded that the country’s provisional military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free when she returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court dismissed Sheikh Hasina’s motion saying it does not require bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued she needed the bail to return to the country to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after Oct. 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, deny the accusations against them.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has failed to contact children in the Helmand and Kandahar hazardous areas to the south.
A UN spokesperson said this happened despite promises by the Taliban not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV's legal battle
BSkyB has lost its trial following the ruling of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission said that, in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following a deal aimed at actually preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Bureau of Fair Trading reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV shares cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate the
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB retorted that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would be unreasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially given that BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. attorney general has appointed a special prosecutor to verify the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All this was born from the report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officers interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators, obstructing justice.
"Serious, unsubstantiated allegations of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 removal of nine U.S. prosecutors by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department said prosecutors were fired because of poor benefits.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to assign political connotations to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ends up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these layoffs, and ended up "abdicating" his role as a leader, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of the failure to cooperate during the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honoured" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute, fifty-second song was the title of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the awards ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly does.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English charts, and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing surgery to cure his heartbeat that became irregular, after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents are unable to give directions to get to Extra Place because they have never heard of it.
The street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - not to be confused with Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 long, it resembles a dusty alleyway rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repaver Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and boutiques, which are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets on the block.
But the City’s Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Neighbourhood Owners Committees, representatives from City Agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street stay in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the #3 Committee.
“There are few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place,” she said.
"They could propose to put it back in order and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repaint the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the manufacturer will grant the space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Avalon Bay spokesperson Michele de Milly said that while the company wants to operate the street, that doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to remodel this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale to her."
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further stressing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The posterior entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Ramones manager Danny Fields, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scraps, shavings, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.”
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be fucked up in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contestations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") recounts the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark by day as by night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers flying along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs nimblely down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the headquarters of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, lies next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, on his side, said he felt that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former fellow of studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought.
Attracting the favors of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama’s campaign points out that “African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program especially supports among many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many newcomers, study English.
Among the students of CM1, 100% passed the 2008 State Maths Exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language-of-arts exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to another ingredient than that put forward by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, a constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here's an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Sixth Street principal Linda Mikels, this school has introduced "full immersion" English language instruction.
Total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Shouldn’t Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools that are predominantly Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although he favors the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop controversy over the wording of English-language laws.
On the contrary, he said, “you have to make sure that your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than despise them or consider them insignificant.
A sharp decline in oil following the new worries in the world of the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday as people fear that the bailout in favor of financial markets could bring the economy back to life.
Futures trading in crude oil fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by Wall Street’s financial turmoil, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again worried despite the deal on the biggest bailout in history, reached this weekend by congressional leaders.
The news was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the latest episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said this weekend’s frenzied talks, concluded with the bailout deal, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchanges has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally, and in particular, in China.”
The bank's analysts lowered their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to slowing economic growth, so they were forced to decrease the oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20 percent.
The Determinant Second Time Celebration for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone else in Jets uniform Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He watched the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played heavily under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
“He’s a mediocre player.”
“We communicated extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens dropped the ball because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 lead.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said “the second half or the third?”
When he was told the two- the Jets passed 21 undeniable points in the third half- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeds his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the best cross-country runner of the century, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 from an accommodating race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, played last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career, during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600 meters of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps in today’s eyes – that air pollution would increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive one-mile average in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to cross-country runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain shiny, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was blamed – especially in Kenya, the rival is Ethiopia’s African – for having over-orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, relying in fact on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world records more than the sense of the competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not compete in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her personal record of almost five minutes at her third marathon.
She ran using a skillful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners take a nice advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City Apart, the Pride and Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first all-black city to integrate, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, the description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to make today." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no prison.
It has now become a pilgrimage town.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes—has become touristic thanks to its inclusion in Florida’s travel guide edited by The Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project—remains a place apart.
She is as independent, dignified, and private as she was already in the 1930s, when Hurston recounted that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who “knowing us so little, doesn’t know what he’s losing.”
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious from the eyes of foreigners.
“We are very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a longtime resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It represents both a historical model of black power-taking and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of black southern rural culture - sometimes scorned, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses central Florida, often forgotten, that culminates in a chapter of dark history and human drama.
Bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
“As you cross the road to the left,” she writes, “you’ll find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passing people.
So in barely a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t really a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a lively and eccentric person, who returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin recounted, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his back patio chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world,” said Valérie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a 2003 Hurston biography.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to move a five-lane highway into the city, replacing Kennedy Boulevard, the community's two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mixture of races led to hatred at the gates of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of young white people were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"A lady has even died."
They threw a watermelon from their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education “insulting rather than glorious of my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, while positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed--I remember well--we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguards, a non-profit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
“You don’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white – I mean there’s a cultural line here,” Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond harm, such as herself, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It exceeds me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true bestseller, reintroduced it to the American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the festival's inauguration two years later, and many return in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county pushed back the proposal of the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-lane motorway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summed it up by saying that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (renamed of course Hurston) opened in 2006 on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, re-paved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent black people.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Permission is required for most interviews, and some things—such as the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the fields—are not to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, like 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, Winter Park twins, seem to have learned the description Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, who pass in this area there, will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance fluently.
In spite of everything, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stood away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are spending the worst "workday in the office" since the 1929 crack.
The deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos still hang out between the residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to queue to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I found out at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about twenty people queuing.
Not in front of the cashier's counters, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their chequebooks, tourists asked for direction to the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all queuing for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-equity bank, resorted to the bankruptcy trustee, and as New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees in front of me, frightened of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that is doing the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone about Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its meager CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank, "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Muslim tombs profaned as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating red-streaked mosques.
Police accuse far-right extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of far-right political parties in the country's general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, an organized action.
The delinquents painted Jewish symbols such as the Star of David on several tombs, but detectives believe it could have been done to disguise the extremists’ sense of hatred for Muslim immigrants.
This accident could somehow be related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of the desecration, which comes just during the religious month of Ramadan that is nearing its end.
Austria is seriously thinking about regaining its courage, following its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were even seen by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing scarves and burqas, and even expressed his opposition to Alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out right after the elections defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates have imposed a ban on Glitter for six months, after he expressed to the authorities under his control his intention to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter’s guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Courts of Limited Jurisdiction hearing, but was represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson said: “Thursday, September 25, in Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there at the time.”
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even if he was registered on the lists of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years imprisonment.
Kent police said they would not discuss the particular cases or potential displacements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as well as those abroad.
“We believe it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices that can manage any potential risks much more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the intention most dear to the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from checking his passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, so he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, for him to be registered on the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom, for holding images of child abuse.
A source at the interior ministry said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was reassured and happy to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master off-stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no outerwear.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, when we discover intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the program of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the public.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you must not take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and character of their own.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture moments of flamenco stars’ personality with the camera.”
With the festival "Popular Song of the Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recall classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essentials and the magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, getting to know them and being able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
In photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters that sometimes you do not know or that only leave you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I still try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery, located at number 20 of Rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People's Garden of Hercules) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has as its main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize-winning literary favorite confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia festival that the novel currently occupying him "is a real audacity" and that "everything demonstrates that he should not write it".
"If I were reasonable, I would not, but I will and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts, which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists marching through the city of the aqueduct and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award by a majority of the participants, made the theater Juan Bravo a crowded venue.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in front of a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of his work in a "faithful" and "faithful"
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure amusement, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less similar", because the writers were asked to go "dvolide" and "dvolide".
Bad weather spoils the Pozoblanco fair
The party of the banderillas that concluded the bullfights of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the toréadors on horseback checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has been fierce on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bullfight planned.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements against the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderillas planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the stalls discovered applauded more than his fight itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he got whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Arminón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants in a van and the latter two flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., according to information released by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit were conducting vehicle checks on the N-1, on the border of the Commune of Arminón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers away on the sidewalk, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
Basque police eventually arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashballs and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, officials found that the license plate had been "forged" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they charged the detainee with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was placed in custody for the various steps and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving a Drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her make strange moves trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California police patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "was pressing the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she drove on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," which is why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was dismissed from the start, although “according to police officers’ observation at first glance, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug.”
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was discharged from the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Advisor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favor treatment to his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behavior of the political party that it will have to adopt in the city council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left called for the investigations to be "transparent" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants".
"Blood of May", Garci's daring gamble
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci assures that he realized with this filming "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2nd of May in Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Commune of Madrid constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decors and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has mistaken itself as leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Blood of May" - because he was not able to shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a start" influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humbling" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of May", "Seven French Billiard Tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re working only for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and at the age of three went to live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
His dance was sensual and they told me my way of dancing was the same as his,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done in "La porta aperta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The staging was also thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, to the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; to the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as to the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who played the role of the companion".
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or values her work,” says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennate
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia's fiveth anniversary to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón's Award of the Litor Award" (2006-2008), organized
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" that was inaugurated in the month of May last and which, after having travelled during the different provinces of New York International, will
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the best-known Andalusian poets.
America Likes Less Without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard for him to get an Oscar.
He hasn’t toured since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightened, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, there is only admiration left for human beings and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, as the Foundation for Drug Control created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the height of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put the bar on us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: by being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was loyal even if the opportunities were not lacking for him not to be.
“But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he has never been more proud than the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could be realized in 2016.
But I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but in my opinion it was the worst race I’ve ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of an elimination note.
But let’s look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Mistakes begin with the removal of the bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
That’s not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the 'S' size for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small-sized jerseys with less fabric and therefore cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't mark the start properly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect race example, this one would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to get around the company's campus) in response to what was asked of a conversation at the time.
Through a camera and a system for recognizing shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and she tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
- Impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have as many related programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
A change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome came to the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google’s first move to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
It has the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right. I'm sorry.
It will never disappear but we must see the “death” of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who are half of the applications supplied with the system?
Who can do the most, can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer apps, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, months cluttered, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of Microsoft’s employee-only rest rooms in Redmond.
On the drinks dispenser, a poster their request to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, it will cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the Muscular Gay Association.
And if we begin to enumerate all his apparitions, we could also mention this strong mustache who lifted weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a men's cotton jersey that's slim and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although he is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the most famous bodysuits have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not stop him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the ' Mango Fashion Awards ' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but, at the same time, exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new Mango collection for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s delights us and we are inspired by it a lot for our collections.
I like to walk around the city and watch the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you are a very versatile woman: isn't it?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you take on the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's shoes.
Suddenly, everything is connected.
You weren’t 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
No, not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years rejoice me.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with fewer problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a little girl and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not concerned.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I can't wait for them to come out.
I am a woman from the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can’t wait for the films ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
Let's see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't go up the bridge to do the model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for quite some time, to invite me to participate in a London charity parade for her women's support association and the clothes we exhibit - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were being auctioned off to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so much about her, I know her, a lot of things aren’t true.
Also, the good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol offenders will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for blood alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting intoxicated, or if he does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and it now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is the reintegration of the driver by offering courses in road rehabilitation.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety but also the Directorate General of Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, the car resumes.
The alcoholic block would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65 per cent of offences in the first year of installation.
And in Spain, it is estimated that it could save 115 people’s lives every year.
This measure is based only on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, the reform done by criminal means requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Exactly tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
Mexico without peep-toes
At 5:40 p.m., the official scheduled time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on the eve of setting but its rays still required to put their hand as a visor to be able to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, very well, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or so...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, all right.
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are several waiting in the airport shed near the red carpet and in a military row of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when her hair is in the wind, is dressed very sober and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before going to the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the doorstep of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
The most prestigious award in fashion
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the showcase of Mango at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface area.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Alongside the table of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having a big heart and making a good heart against bad fortune, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some breathtaking ELAH adornments, and arm in arm with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a coat because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with trousers and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner was transformed into a sexy and black long dress, was moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the rehearsals of the ballets and remembering the good old days, she made a big bar.
Inés Sastre did not stay for visiting the palace outbuildings, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another handsome man who travels by motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked beforehand that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are not just 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all off, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The morning awakening almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7 o'clock, but it's even worse when we think of the restless pace that life imposes on us today.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in places like work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If the adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it may surprise you, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
Anyway, this is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with screams, weeping, long speeches...
In case sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
As soon as sleepiness appears, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because in sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
What's more, you'll hear what he's saying, but you won't know what he's dreaming about, so pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even kidding.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s nothing very bad, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of shortage.
Without making a great match, the Yellows and Blacks created the most opportunities and managed to turn one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very fast during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visiting captain Kauffmann, who was scouring the skylight on a far shot, Illhaeusern would take the ascender slightly and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn on top, Romain at the foot or Diebold came to tickle the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, they were blocked in the middle of the field and they just left the stirring Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two chances signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhusians by Marais, well positioned to take a ball repelled on a first attempt of Diebold (53').
But the Illhousiens scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose big problems to an Illusian Eleven who just backed down a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play where, after a big drift, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by the Breton fishermen to get measures in the face of the soaring diesel prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
According to the spokesman of the Elysée David Martinon, the president will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors.
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of almost 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon was also blocked, but links to Belle-<0xC3><0x8E>le were not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the peninsula of Quiberon.
The sailors have already shown their determination Monday by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic and Channel fronts, such as the Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers stayed at docks, or to Le Havre, where about 20 boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery in the evening.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the planned interview at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up anything" and "do not want to move to Paris", for example, announced Liliane Cariou, the chair of the fisheries committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with a diesel of less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes hailed the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession that looms over the global economy.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15 percent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and U.S. retirement business, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
AIG's board of directors met Sunday evening to consider possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
Assets that AIG plans to divest include its aerial leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been made on these divestitures, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly cash in to repay the Federal Reserve's $85 billion loan at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting its current shareholders in proportion.
Analysis Paris History of the session Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange saw a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to bail out banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (or 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street plunged after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan, which was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said FTN Financial’s Lindsey Piegza.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
"If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be swiftly passed to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Ms. Piegza.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities arranged for the acquisition of Wachovia’s banking business by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has abruptly accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just a US crisis, but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632 percent, compared to 3.82 percent on Friday night, and the 30-year one to 4.161 percent, compared to 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins points in first televised duel
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House succeeded another to know who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters have proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen says McCain's performance, while honorable, was not "brilliant enough" to stop his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), judges that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama came out victorious for 39% of respondents, while 25% of them gave victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected performance of his colleague, Joseph Biden, in the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She's got good instincts," Clinton said at the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, while highlighting his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he has accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without dismantling himself, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does," a Democratic spot retorted this weekend accusing the Republican of not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American on the street."
“During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He didn’t even say the words “middle class” or “workers.” The financial detour clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the brink of the cliff.
“The coming week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
The current debacle is the eight-year final verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
Reaffirming that he would still manage to cut taxes by 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street uprisings, the Illinois senator also pointed out that achieving possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion bailout plan passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents were demonstrating on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday night as polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they haven't even voted, "What's the point, since they'll do what they want with my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made foreign observers look good in order to regain its language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were considered proper by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the count," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," said Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is the votes, and at us it's the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and proposals for laws.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, may not recognize the validity of the ballot.
She points out that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“You noticed that there was an election, you?” asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night falls back on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice as Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, he regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delayed in filing his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
"When Héma-Québec started operations in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence," she said before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
From its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases in Europe of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond a doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle we applied made sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (TANs), which allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The NATs have shortened the mute period, which extends between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, says the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This substantially reduced the risk that some donors would become infected without knowing it and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before there is a case of HIV transmission through a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover our health,” says the CEO of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary continues, noting that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for an adequate supply.
“The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cell or platelet refills.
The ageing population also has implications for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
However, any healthy person aged 18 years and over who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where malaria is present, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and are no longer able to donate their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
Today’s life is so frantic, you rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood,” Decary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the banking of our 1,000th sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than 1,000 a year.
We should start proposing for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they are not able to access it," because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the semi-final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoffs, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 total goals) win over the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goalless first half on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets in the Montreal line-up.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
In the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to kick off the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian to the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in that win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a great ovation.”
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest travelled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
"Repose the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of image mill.
Looped on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the election period.
In a press briefing, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he would trigger elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it ours, but it is ours,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec has built a lot on its relationship with the North, he said: the Abitibi gold rush, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government.”
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to ice melt.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP for Ungava), have already begun consultations with about 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give each other a common vision".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded him.
“Like the Liberals who came before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Plant as Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another, conservative reference to this, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, stirring up applause at home.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which is permitted by law.
He points out that his schedule is fulfilled, however, notably by a mission of the federation council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed like a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and that they would have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad lines of the Plan Nord were met with scepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North-Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
In her view, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that takes place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from a holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has fought a relentless struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that are being accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier crumble in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the accused's guilt.
As a reminder, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that Harper keeps waving and that rings so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when no morals exist anymore: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a minority head of government until now (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - The Orwellian Discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Senior Vice President, Canadian Barrick Gold Mining.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small pennyless publishing house in order to launch a “transparent public debate.”
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to scare anyone who dares to look again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally take place through the exchange of ideas, not through batons.
It was therefore enough for the mining industry to open up its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both call for a "public" debate while scorning the opinions of that same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers does so first and foremost because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not as part of what many perceive as a gag-chase (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice to the authors of Black Canada instructing them to cease the use of the term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal discourse, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, en bloc, the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss issues that displease the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long managed debates and disagreements and resolved conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit this kind of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news just minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great strides towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done in a way to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned into a sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect of a further failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline we had agreed was to open markets this morning.
Lately associated with the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election showed rather favorable to the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction that we are forced to reach this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed to himself the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and one on the salaries of executives of businesses that have been rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines that I have read [show] that this is something that we are all going to have to digest and with which we are going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayer money the dubious, risky and unsellable assets of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgages (subprimes) before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulting in a freeze of liquidity and the dislocation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who thwarted the first draft agreement last week.
They are believed to have emerged from this impasse since Democrats agreed that some “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover its bet.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of $250 billion to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil has passed.
The federal government will have the option of delaying forfeiture procedures in respect of the housing attached to the property loans covered by this plan, as well as setting limits on compensation and severance payments to the executives of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Yesterday, there were still voices against the bill, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the way to benefit the taxpayers.”
An entertainer of a small group in Congress dubbed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us saying: Congress is asked not to rush and carefully consider the way forward,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas said it was refusing to acquire its competitor in the midst of shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the U.S. housing loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s 20 largest banks and 10 largest insurers.
“This is not money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are unclear."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed on the way to nationalize another bank badly affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (US 75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure has long been his asset, some will say his weakness.
Was he freed from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will have also removed him from the power register that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the booming years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on screen, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breaking of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
For in him projected a whole country self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theater, on television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who finished second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadowy areas of this secret star, discreet, committed, allergic to the splinters of the show-business, which we have not quite pierced the enigma, also disappear with him.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman caused the moviegoers dizziness this weekend, as his great roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Back in memory the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on a Burning Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and avenging pool player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar out of nine nominations.
That face through the ages was him.
Just him again.
The times are moving through his path.
Young people know him especially through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as the Irish Mafia godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who left the trade early enough, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendours and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to the "underplaying" deeming its performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long into the mouth.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginalized: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true modesty.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of modesty and sadness.
Amid the rain of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great buddy and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger to Hollywood's drifts also disappears.
Many will have seen his binette sit on pots of dressing, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gag at first.
Nonetheless, the proceeds from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Distressed Children.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And it is a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizen model, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings concerning the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, having resulted in particularly significant damage. Other charges have been held against them, such as forgery and use of forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, into the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing cost invoices, behind which no actual services were provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the indictment, much of the bills were false.
For the latter, they procured invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they manufactured the stamps at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to spot pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they were going to submit, among others, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for as many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was filled with errors of form and substance.
A boarding house in Badacsonytomaj actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could stay there, yet the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The issuers of invoices with overflowing imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért nor Hoppá's name appeared, according to information given to the prosecutor's office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company's manager, told hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people had stayed there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but only organized trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also goes against the accounting practices of the agency.
In addition, as was shown during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, the destination of which is located outside the European Union, are charged without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of the Hotel Révfülöp under Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. In addition, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fake ones were handwritten.
The Prosecutor's investigation reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in mentioning as a service the carriage of goods by road, which the issuing company of the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for defects of form, such as inappropriate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont turned out to be false.
Just as in the case of the Ravenna Bt. company or the Kunfehértó sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also failed to pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their home.
Deliberately Established Invoices
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were required to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialisták group, has prepared an invoice to the order of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was led to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and in 2003, issued invoices to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület Association, for an amount of about five million HUF.
There were no financial moves, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies did not mention this in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general manager of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he could not be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also reportedly sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt companies in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies operated, which the accused explains by the fact that they were not receiving work.
At the request of Ma<0xC3><0xAE>tre Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the foundation documents of the companies, he prepared invoices in their names, to the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov has given agencies, 15 invoices in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
Prosecutors believed that 10% of the amounts shown on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the Szi-Beri Bt. company to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció Association and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the socialist party's public utility, Táncsics Mihály Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy in the amount of two times 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants will report on the method of making the invoices, as they had previously done before the prosecutor's office.
What could be really interesting is that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, possibly, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably offended, since requests for his placement in a supervised residence, based on a relief of his conditions of detention, are continually falling into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The Psychology of Over-Billing: Why Do We Spend More Money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced in this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer to pay too high a price.
This research attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lotto, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the over-bid of a third, the whole under the brainstem, called the striatum, was moving intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, in addition to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
During these sessions, three groups overtook a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was on victory in one group and on failure in the other.
By proving the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the team of players "against failure" were willing to bet higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation.” – Andrew Schotter, professor in the Faculty of Economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should we see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that the number of patients carrying the hepatitis virus is one hundred thousand in Hungary, but only seven miles follow treatment, because often the patients do not know that they are carrying the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against A and B viruses anyway. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach ache and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stool becomes lighter and the urine takes a darker color.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not known to have the virus, because the pathogenic gene slyly destroys liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooed people.
Currently, there are 200 million people with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the deaths of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment by analyzing how belief in God could influence human pain tolerance.
As part of this bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them was observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments involving academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university.
Specifically, the experiment unfolds in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is fixed to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look steadily at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four parts successively, while watching either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
Catholics said that at the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt as if they were "safe", as if they were "cared for" and they were "calm, and peace has invaded them".
At the sight of the religious-themed painting, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they watched Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided that one finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image that they react to very positively, such as a mother or father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it does change our personality," Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what effect would be on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if the believers were shown a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better quality Virgin Mary result in better results?
You are what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets as well as the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While sceptics draw a parallel to Orwell’s horror vision, they don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that the founders of Google can meet their original goal which sounded like this: "Let's collect in one system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of global work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What work would be best for me?" However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, the day they know enough about users.
It is not entirely clear to all internet users that the words used during searches on the internet, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then viewed by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit us our products and services based on our previous statements.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or possibly revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, allowing an identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm-on-hand with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right in court before the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the constitutional points to disclose information about the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years ago. But in the end, it did not succeed in obtaining the lists of searches of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is being reproached by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they believe that their private sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wildlings" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big business, the "trendy corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as an invader of the world because of Windows, and this, although both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the package of programs, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, the web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link these to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm recently. These young people can also keep blogs or Flicks on their photos, in which they appear more automatically.
While we can take note of many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands from the sight of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of its employees private, just for the sincere opinions that this one has written on his blog about top management, we can be totally on the one.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and this is how we can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. The services of Google online, from word processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not linked to huge profiles of servers, and which do not exist until today.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding from it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious computer migraines not only by Microsoft, but by many other programs.
However, critical observers find, next to all of this, contradictions having worrisome effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after it has doubled the price of the Chinese corporate nursery school, after the good results of 2006, and after the company has found their daily multiple restoration too expensive, taken at any time.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the next few months and years, they will move the world medical results on new points. While some think that the complete scanning and archiving project of Google books and magazines can take on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself in front of the Court.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian halftones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way only through Google data.
Two minors helped clear traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime," - said the spokesman of the police station department of Borsod.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are being accused of, and for the time being, they are being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
Murder accomplice can result in up to five years of detention.
The suspect in the <0xC3><0x93>zd double homicide, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime, and the weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the repurchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the repurchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that wants to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish offer represents the highest offer to date for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Nasdaq Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new least good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of the holdings, followed by 14.7 percent of bank Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse by the day, the leading newspapers of the European press are already talking about a "second 9/11".
"The global financial catastrophe is owed to the American president" - accuses the daily of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised in a hurry, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett once said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 9/11.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing every day, and thereafter, the whole world will pay the heavy price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, but according to the congressional vote, a real danger threatens, one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat cannot be ignored any longer - notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still lend a lifeline to their wobbly financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will suffice.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to ignore their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, the weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to get their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent.
The "saviors" must not immediately brandish a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car mimics the bumblebee’s flight
What better method would be to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if not the imitation of an already existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, buzzing bees gave the starting strategic idea to Nissan engineers, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired BR23C self-robotized control system, which it equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee forms its own space, oval in shape, which in reality looks very much like our secure protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations department of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters from the BR23C, assesses distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre right away.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it by an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the mini-robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and the most internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must be carried out in the blink of an eye.
In contrast to bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotational movement, acceleration as well as the slowdown as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy concentration, which makes them longer in life than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance, which Nissan estimates will make its way into mass-produced cars in the next decade.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles in his path.
We even gave the priceless baby a name
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, aimed at repurchasing the banks’ dubious loans, and to be used in multiples, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
Reuters reports that in new debates lasting until after midnight on Saturday, Congressional leaders have agreed on controversies over the $700 billion bailout.
"We've taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is backed by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of saving Wall Street here, but of turning the gears of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., depending on Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
Moreover, the program diverges from the Bush administration's original proposal that the $700 billion should be spent in one go to buy back the securities for dubious credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the bill is passed by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy dubious loans from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The spending of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious debts, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" debts.
The department's competent persons stated that the repurchases can take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that cause the concerns, for which the companies have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast redemption of dubious debts, their insurance, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of either major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank executives who are in bad shape and waiting for state aid can expect their severance pay, simply called the golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Wage caps are mentioned only in specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the company.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back as part of an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the redemption of the suspicious receivables, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the executives is not exaggerated.
In order for the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only applies to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal caps will be in place regarding the appointments of directors-general, said the chairman of the House Financial Benefits Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state obtains a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be a winner in the case as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens have mandated us, this doesn't protect taxpayer dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democrat colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Statistical Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, while compared to a year earlier, they decreased by 3.9 percent.
As a result of domestic and export price fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to those of the previous month, and by 3.2 per cent compared to those of the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices rose only to a lesser extent: 0.1 percent, compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industries were only slightly up 0.1 percent from July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather goods and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), with firstly bags and belt manufacturing with a monthly increase of 4.6 percent, then footwear production with a monthly increase of 2.5 percent.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of products and chemical materials (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry experienced an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which play a significant role in domestic industrial operations, prices rose 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since July 1.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, the most significant increase was in oil processing sector prices (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical product manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price declines occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (3.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors surpassed those of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 percent) was initiating profit-on-investment sectors.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while those in the energy and materials-producing sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was seen in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-initiating sectors it was measured at 1.4 per cent.
Export prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, rose 1.1 percent in August from the previous month, while they fell 3.9 percent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, and by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes there is a good chance that around January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force, as the Foreign Minister told local Hungarian community leaders in Chicago.
“Now everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into service.”
All times she has drawn attention to the fact that in the new system there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to check in before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in talks from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain Support Bank Rescue Plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support of the $700 billion government bailout plan, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have reached agreements in principle on the bailout of the banks.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the focus on economic issues, Obama has again managed to get a little ahead, and McCain's lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as runner-up right after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would swiftly pass the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he also supports.
"It is now that we must act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sector and the stability of the entire economy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have trouble swallowing it... but doing nothing is not a possible path.”
The Republican senator stated that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Control Board and the capping of senior executive severance payments, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the UHC began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of epoch is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the time of the much-mentioned Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the "devouring his parents" modernization, implemented in the region in a consistent way by the UHC.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been strongly mistaken about the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that, in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of traditional citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the craftsmen, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates.
In these groups, UHC support fell below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic policy that took place after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian SPÖ Socialists want to talk with the ÖVP Conservatives.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations, and the Greens are still unwilling to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates held on public television, party leaders have barely let their maps glimpse.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to talk with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann’s part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer responded cautiously to the proposals of the Reds.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or of joining the coalition is currently a completely open question, and these issues must absolutely be debated within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider is once again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka said: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and therefore, one of the main obstacles to their success in the country.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, Járóka warned that in addition to the distinctions observed during the hiring, Roma disappear from the labor market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school degrees, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a higher education degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in enforcing other fundamental rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the EU member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child begins school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"Because of their nationality from the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education." - emphasized L<0xC3><0xAD>via Járóka.
According to the MEP, an objective-oriented and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of disintegration of schools. To this end, compliance with existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the opportunities that democracy provides, so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
In the name of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the European Equal Opportunities Summit, held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, both at European level and at the level of the Member States.
UHC: Grace for a Transition Period
It is in October that the decision will be made on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite this unfortunate election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
Party president Erwin Hube and regional head of government Günther Beckstein can still hold their seats. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they were not especially interested in their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the angry members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the height of his career - the Christian-Socio-Union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria’s “only sovereign” giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still rely heavily on this southern region, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tamper talks with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing coalition values, about a
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered into the legislation, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat without hesitation the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role.The former head of the regional government and former UHC president, has designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks to the CDU, which he said would have earned much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will again be able to become Chancellor only if she somehow rebuilds the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005, with a common force.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of CSU land will not negatively influence the big coalition in Berlin.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been doing very well opposition for long decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) opposition was seriously hoping that Lukashenko's presence, renewing his term as president for the fourth time during the "constitutional changes" on dubious elections.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians don't get a natural gas entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on running for a third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament, which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of worries on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put sticks in the wheels when it comes to broadcasting, but I can also see that they are more and more properly supported elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of the most social security, the Lukhenko, the most important.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure against the little smarts is in force, against whom points and then will drink the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving doors,” says Brunetta, “are an instrument to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services.”
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
“It’s reformism,” Brunetta said.
The installation in all establishments of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from employees was recorded, the secretary general said: "It's a process shared by employees, and we've had the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smilingly, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration Public
In three months, the absence of sickness of public employees has decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year.
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to the rates of inflation.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Order using Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is now spreading the data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace due to illness," writes the Consumers' Association, "the population of "active lazy people" continues to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of infirmity due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's domicile, during which the inspections are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains a leading cause of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, the Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of the Mutilated and Invalid of Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "heartfelt appreciation for the ongoing associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of the public"
Naturally indignant, everyone has struck a fist to put an end to such tragedies that, because of their dimension, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness among young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about social severity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The data of the accident victims at work seems to signal a slight positive trend, but that does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive," said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
“We do not want this ‘rebate trend’ to be translated into minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention relaxes that tragedy happens.
"We believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"We believe that more checks and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, from school onwards," Mercandelli said.
- He added- "that there is still an effort to be made in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced the "gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "derived assistance to which the system is moving in recent years".
"The objective is to give the worker the insurance guarantee," he added, "so that the fate of the person who has an accident must not depend on spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislator."
Mp3 player pointed at the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which in a statement released in Brussels, quotes the Scientific Committee's opinion on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
“From this scientific report, it appears that 5-10% of those who, over a period of at least five years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones may unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," Kuneva said.
"According to the scientific data - continues the head of the Ue - this is a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What matters most is raising consumer awareness and making this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow up on new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"The scientists-concluding the EU Executive confirm that there is good reason to be concerned, and that the European Commission will now discuss with Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents, against exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit this data well using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we are starting, in March we are ending, in June we will draw the money.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so that in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno will be presented.
"The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - Alemanno would like to stress - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome that can be used by the political decision-makers, which remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No superimposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, to a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman city dwellers, and will be used to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit, ".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but also "in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is really cocky: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the bowels of the southern United States wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
Here emerges an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
Say what you want, we will see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Anyway, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
In spite of this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s point of weakness.
Whoever takes George W’s place will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mind control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly tell the news attachés, feel less worried about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they once did.
The problem with American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as it is heard by the general public is not to be reduced in a consistent way.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and print newspaper journalists are convinced that national journalism is going the wrong way.
Locally, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses are making a move to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of the newspaper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel is increased up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hopes that it would “do something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest clash in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to “work safety”.
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 thousand a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, after a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It is the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the proceeding of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the Unipol-Bnl escalation investigation.
During his trial last week, he had obtained home release transformed into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel the route from the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its East Coast soul watchman, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and Southern States.
The very soul, precisely, which made itself felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is only one example of the changes, the great changes that the economic earthquake that is underway predicts or already lets go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena incubated for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of sovereign state, in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, of course, close relations with foreign countries, but that, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question, or does not have much to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, is divided between the various interests and between the various national strategies, and cannot decide on any common political lines.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and stimulus plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credits: when we go through a difficult period, it is only the states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary resources and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements of which no market or international organization can ever dispose in a similar way.
This new emphasis of the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
. Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we have now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the things that are not enough material, such as water.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Hence, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shade.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even troubling: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries of the West.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in the improvised electoral "revolts" or else, in the changes of right-wing right of recent times, it could regress against the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the Great Labor Party.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have more and more difficulty, which is not from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and agitates potentially in ways that do not exist.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
Keeping your eyes wide open is not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded in doing so.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body glued onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherence.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, it "detachs easily from the wall," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Could be to walk on walls like Spiderman?Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superhero.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made of hair-like microfibers, which self-cleanses dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices.
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are desiccant and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption, amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in a box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he released a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice to reduce their patients.
Grapefruit juice has already been heavily criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stam and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself that gave the news in a two-year-old newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what they drink, if they take medications such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT AS PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medications.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international agencies of drugs that will need to change the informative notes of the drugs.
It is always worth reading the illustrative papers of the drugs you are taking, and, if something is not clear, not getting impressed, but being clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of the consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and that was blamed on the economist for years, but has now proved to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “high-value economist”, but also a very aggressive “style” publicist, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility born for the latest Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ISO Format, ODF (O Open Document).
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are some features specific to some modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphic design module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that unite the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text maker.
Collaboration between multiple people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the development of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring certain OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphical module.
Goal for 2008 to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s test specimens are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus revamping the polka-dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKED Whether ITALY IS RACED?
Italy "as a country of emigration has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" who are reluctantly welcomed.
The New York Times has dedicated a long article debating the subject of racism in Italy, starting with the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the Nordic regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "a strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Lega Nord".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals, is cited as proof of the changing climate in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The market for student rentals is not experiencing a crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support," explains the head of Sunia's research office, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market so much that a process of widespread increase has started for them.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free, unregistered, rent-free contracts, sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the taxation, are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (zone Bande Nere), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask for about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
One can only save if one moves away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed you need 300/400 euros, for a single one you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, in cities such as Perugia, where rents are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities are moving the historic rooms.
Historical cinemas close in favor of multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumptive mono-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems to us inescapable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and loaded with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of path and so many emotions" observes the director of the cinema Nuovo Paradiso, film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Jury of Cannes, and who told the poems of the province of Cannes, and always.
The figures provided by Anec, the main trade association, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the theaters of the main cities that paid the most: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia-Romagna leads with 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms t that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between 16 and 18 million euros a year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote mono cinemas in historic centers and on the outskirts.
Among the regulations, there are measures of tax facilities in favor of managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the area with limited traffic, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
However, it is obvious that in order to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so much shared emotions, I turn to the other side not to see the panels blackened by the dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the City Hall with the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
heavy accusations are made by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous to the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"An affront to legal and moral norms, and especially common sense," write the prosecutors, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"This would have been granted to the clan," the judges write, "officially to enter the town halls, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and orientation of the public administration."
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the SVP at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out to scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused Vice Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti at the time, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political issue, but given the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is emerged "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones are launched.
This is an enormous deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that colossus like Chevron have set their eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by sea-swell operating systems.
That would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be the currents and the tides.
Colossians in the attack.
The first company to focus on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years from now, more and more candidates among these companies that have always been dedicated to traditional energy are focusing on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesperson for a company associated with the American oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the path of energy from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, indicate growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still in its infancy, due to the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a big problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure causes a turbine to rotate, which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping mall and parking lot using six submarine turbines from New York’s East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that powers a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
Particular interest, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves right now, the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and expects investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
