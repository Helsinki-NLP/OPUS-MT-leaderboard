The Prague Stock Exchange is falling down against closing.
After the steep decline in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of normal day trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange started trading on Tuesday as it fell by a further six percentage points.
This time the reason was for the Wall Street burglary.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is shown.
Case of stocks in Asia
The stocks on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to offset some of the losses, reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index there.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam.
Although it belongs to China, Hong Kong determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt the bill to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the burglary.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which should be spent up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion K<0xC4><0x8D>).
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices recorded the largest plunge in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar drop it last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was hardly any indication that the draft would not pass in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress Makes Concession: US Government May Pump $700 Billion into Banks
The Supreme Representatives of Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of a financial assistance agreement for the American financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks over the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of a $700 billion financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, this does not mean victory yet.
Congressmen have yet to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
According to different reports, the Senate could vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication that the plan is to be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
However, this leads to "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms that could help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to him, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
On Sunday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of non-purchasable mortgage assets from financial companies, which put financial firms in serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're on target," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid said lawmakers are trying to reach a final deal before Sunday in Congress.
The aim is to reassure investors of trades in Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone where a congressional decision could affect trades on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, also there is uncertainty as to whether the negotiations at the last minute could still fail at a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
However, Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, with another $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush positively assesses progress in negotiations
The president has a veto in this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finance for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen, has remained because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We have worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of Golden Parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing benefits and a timeline for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the program and sets up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on help for homeowners who are having trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages it buys, with the goal being to lower monthly costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"It is because we do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive in Marek’s view.
“More importantly, congressmen agree to support the plan and pass it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there is an adoption is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek said.
Duel on knife edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can yet make a phone call.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it is better to buy only one phone.
Despite all this, there are plenty of reasons why you should acquire an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely it is hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you’re probably dreaming of at least one of them.
This is also simplified with the music on travel, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a pink-floyd fan will probably not be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even insinuately.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you include the smart phones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
However, the universality of mobile phones also brings with it disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music longer than ten to twelve hours, most of the time it is much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you then still make phone calls from time to time, for safety, you prefer to buy a charger for the office - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones keep at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one time charging out.
Another problem is when you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB connector, and it is also not possible to connect any mobile phone directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can cope with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones without reduction.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
If for you music is primarily a backdrop and you only listen to it briefly every day, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost any mobile phone can do.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or player can handle.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and in addition, most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of one provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can in and of itself be a striking argument for why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that precisely this type of music sales (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones with them.
If you feel like listening to yourself, grab your phone in your jacket pocket while the player is at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least one wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you will get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the easy operation.
The simplest – and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) – player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation to the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no danger of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you use?
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns will suffice.
Attention, though.
For the basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive ones can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more sophisticated listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone buttons for MP3, and the ease of use is close to that of a single MP3 player.
The widest is Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe he won't wait long.
That the Czech mobile service providers are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already reported on Mobil.cz many times.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the Telecommunications Authority <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the European Commission’s latest steps in the regulation of roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation – for some customers of Czech mobile providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to scold that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) often agrees with this, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network will no longer have a lot of opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought with it a significant price reduction, to which also the classic mobile providers had to respond.
Even before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices on the market in the UK as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be really successful.
By the way, it doesn’t take long to look for examples.
In February, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a traditional provider.
You don’t need to have a relatively high cost of building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also take hold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering."
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile carrier conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region," said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, press secretary for the financial group Penta, in a telephone call for Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The GTS Novera Group has long shown its interest in launching a virtual mobile provider, which wants to take another step in order to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only landline but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have already been able to make progress in negotiations," said the group's press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market has large specifics compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by anyone with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the press department of Telefónica O2 in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová rarely agrees with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on.”
“On the T-Mobile network, hardly any virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer to think in the short term.”
Vodafone is focusing its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the creation of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was coming from T-Mobile when U:fon was launched.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and above all on its services."
However, in view of this approach of the mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is astonishing.
This is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which unfortunately, unlike the United Kingdom and other advanced countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in his reply to our request.
Representatives of the providers would not be surprised by such a formulation.
This is more than questionable by an authority that should represent consumer interests and, among other things, ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it is to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price cut are probably not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile phone providers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely equal price of gasoline at the petrol stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not detected any evidence in this case that indicates anti-competitive action and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary instruments to open up the mobile market for virtual providers are also likely to be lacking for the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has - logically - a monopoly on its network.
This means that it necessarily assumes a dominant position in a particular segment.
But even if one does not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are acting strikingly similarly.
Complaints by a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The shifting of responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of the competences of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the area of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need only know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudovirtual providers remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partially public.
Usually these are companies that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which may lead to a termination of cooperation with the corresponding company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be around with the managers of the mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
They do not receive negligible profits from the activities of these companies, and at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out that "the law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile providers.
But that alone would have to happen to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> at least strange.
There is also another question for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile providers close their eyes to such an action, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has quite strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers that they do not know of it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant decrease in prices for the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence practically more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, regulators intervened at these moments, which did not try to protect the interests of mobile providers, but rather those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in the competencies in these cases is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the gun into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider will soon appear, the Czech mobile market may soon get back on track.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, <0xC3><0x9A>OHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally not make phone calls more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best hotel deals
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech State Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country.
The anthem was newly performed by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both of them and then with the choir, so that you understand the text well, so that a harmony is created," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first played on the stage of the State Theatre in 1834 in the originally Czech piece Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was from Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first stanza of the song then became an organic component of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers to enter a subway, tram or bus who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently be bought by about one hundred thousand people who have the chip card open card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or yearly coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it displayed on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x9B>lovy Let<0xC5><0x9B>lis, Roz.
The coupons have also been available since yesterday via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the issue window in the subway stations, where until now they had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon over the Internet, it is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, travelers are also provided with a desk with trained staff, which advises interested parties on their online purchases and also displays the coupon on the map," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be used on self-service machines on the open card, which are mounted in some metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket devaluers, the passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> adds.
The coupon is checked by an automated machine instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will operate from tomorrow, is simple.
All you have to do is insert the chip card and the previously purchased coupon will play on its own.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport, train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, which compiles the timetables for Prague's transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout with the driver.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked location on the side of the checkout.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the applied coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and does not know when the coupon will end, can go to the self-service machines where the coupons are placed on the card.
Here, the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans had asked in 1945 for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter which is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would at least like to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly approached the US president in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich agreement by Hitler - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units do not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it said in a letter signed with the words "People who are at heart with the fate of the Sudeten".
Since the Sudeten Germans’ accession to Czechoslovakia suggests that they would expect brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to assume protection over the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
“We cannot believe that, without regard to the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area, you confer on a foreign state that oppresses and eliminates minorities and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors are not able to sign is allegedly the fear of revenge cravings of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a referendum in the Bohemian Forest on whether the inhabitants would become part of the U.S. or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, it does, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, paint a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans had to at least foresee that they would be negotiating their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was employed in the Baltic Sea navy as a Budweiser German during the war.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
If you don't think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also how the emotionally-charged media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday, can be characterized.
The authority of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to ward off drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to deter drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And you also remember to strap yourself up before you start the journey.
The campaign is aimed primarily at young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
If you don't think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are capitalized on a license plate.
And in a blood pool there is the word “pay.”
This means that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see images with dramatic images of accident victims.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities on Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that they save time, for example, if they drive in red.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says traffic psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are panels that alert drivers to a hazard.
"If you put up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer notice it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, chairman of Israel’s provisional government, has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be concluded with Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers rolling over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to forego part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple priests and holy and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for concluding a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians know all too well what they have to do to get back the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terror network and jihad (Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions about the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to roam
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth in the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a 22-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was likely caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman sat next to the driver, in the least secure place in the car, even though she had two more places at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is also equipped with standing seats according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing spaces, as confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We have discussed this with the ministry, and this did not initially agree with the movement of travelers.
Later this has been taken back, and we have come to a consensus that travelers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving when they have their seat,” he said.
The law does not know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward – no legal provision describes that role.
However, there is also no legal provision prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle companion, but its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the spokesman of the ministry Hanzelka clearly.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem retrospectively.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing spaces in the product registration.
That’s all,” he stressed.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing spaces and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing spaces and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP specialist for traffic safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not see the movement of stewards on board a bus as a fundamental problem.
“With a fluid mode of driving, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it’s not sure when the turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump her head.”
"But if a bus brakes sharp, then of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations,” he says, adding that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to provide stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of steward is risky, I will delete it.
Guests can receive coffee and newspapers upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been fighting back from the start.
Sooner or later, this will end with some fatal accident,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz not quite a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region, who had worked for the company for two years, was injured.
The Slovenian truck was probably deflected from the stand without blinking and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two seats were sold for the stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it expects financial compensation from the culprit as well.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
“But this has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones when driving, "says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses being the responsibility of the police and occupational health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf’s hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of big words in the WestLB board’s letter to the House’s staff.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, says the letter made known on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "skills block" with sustainable earning power into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the state banking sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia has only recently made clear that it is time to find a solution for the future.
However, the connection between the Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know about because of their investment funds, and WestLB has been talked about for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
While Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas said at the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is half-managed by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbände, has instructed the Executive Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, it is said at the financial centre, have just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, Deka-Bank is one of the most important employers at Frankfurt’s financial centre. It is not the first time that we are talking about consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this threefold alliance.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba participation.
The other two houses did not meet each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka-Bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about going together with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to mature that a reunification of the different houses of the public sector is in need.
Now that the state election in Bavaria is over, a link between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers rises, the partners gradually assume for it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far weathered the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
By joining forces with West LB, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, has pushed a halt at the beginning of the year.
The Nord LB remains at best.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl said the crucial question, with which business model the future viability of the Landesbanken should be ensured, had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which is, of course, not desired there.
Thus, the letter of the local board of directors also mentions that there is definitely a "total solution" for the house.
It will be shown how this can be done by combining individual units with the deca-bank.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearded man and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travelers how deep sounds his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a slap, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", are expected to depart this evening at 11.45 p.m., arrival is expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel in one bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and glasses with wide silver straps, belongs to the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 pm.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
75 euros costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, you're gonna need your strength.
It is maintained in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where also several other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos Group finally arrives at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco delivers one final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersivigiando.it".
Secondly, “When the doors open to the beer tent, it’s called running!” Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and fill the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in the front, otherwise we will block, and not distribute all yellow caps on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tipping.
"We show the security guards that we behave well.
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight point half eleven to be here again!" Understood?
Let's go to Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap is attached to the trees, signs and even the election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; we are talking about 50,000 who are on their way across the Alps and coming into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have arrived this weekend extra from Italy.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps a nation statistic in which the Italians take the first place in front of the British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical services.
Particularly popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed only last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The Munich-listed real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks in order to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to interest the part it also takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are losses with daughter Depfa.
The state financier had refinanced himself extremely short-term, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money - which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, with earnings from allotments to receivables and certain securities as well as from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business falling by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher earnings from reimbursements of downstream settlement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and from the business management for Group companies, the earnings decrease of around 16 percent had remained moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated on commercial real estate loans, which had then been outsourced to Aareal Bank.
Due to under-earnings in traditional state financing, Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must now make amortizations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
By 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financer since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks has largely dried up again as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for a part of Depfa’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros – each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are met with the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely malfunctioning international money markets".
From other sources it can be heard that, thanks to the funds, refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke said that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the bank to be hoped for.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the financing does not have to be used to the full.
But the opposite is not to be eliminated either.
After the bank was still facing bankruptcy late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue is not able to calm the minds.
The share price is falling by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are quite good.
While the primary debts are hardly moving, the prices of the subordinated bonds yield more clearly.
Affected in particular are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the maturities beyond 2009.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds once appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had brought the crisis home with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less-stricken commercial banks are ready to support the system, a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or what is happening is what hardly anyone can hope for at the moment – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports of partial nationalisation, the security-limiting probability has at present become only a legitimate hope.
This should especially prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision whether to part with their commitments.
Short-term investors can, after all, use a closing line to form a loss statement for future remuneration tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before the school trip I had babble.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of lessons at Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils tumble in from eight o’clock until a short meeting with the teacher, the ‘home room’, begins at twenty-nine o’clock.
But before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk in front of people, or in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all huddled, giggled and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" all the time.
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly coughed to my seat.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really assaulted.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me about holes in my belly - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, all their bentos were packed out.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is something different from the dull German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat.
Most of the time, I don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then crafts particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer at the break snack.
I read this in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this as well.
‘Why Japan?’ my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, I’ve been reading manga for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and customs.
And on that one attaches great importance here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings.
Does a rat or a goat flee when in danger mean that they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
For several years, the Internet magazine "Edge" has published articles by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of sensation or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it sets itself up dead, flees or attacks.
Humans behave similarly, as some scientists conclude from a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in man than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic characteristic may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is connected with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however it may be, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or analyzed on the basis of our own experience because of the special hardware, then his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially by using the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one shifts more to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the development of visualization.
What is the result for the sensations?
I trace them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its own activity-conscious brains.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state we are in when the activity of the brain-localized defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
Thus, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which distinguish primates and in particular humans.
Associated with the linguistic nature, fine grades of sensation result, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio says that sensations from more primitive activities in the body’s sensational regions of the cortex and brainstem arise similarly to Jaak Pankseep, but which focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could certainly be involved in cross-genre sensations.
In theory, I can’t contradict it, but I think it’s unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans probably feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees in danger if she also feels fear?
In my view, mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, sharks do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress at the neural level is signaled here, if you measure the same in rats and humans.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, so neither do sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than constantly run against a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Deadline for pardon for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as a sign of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championships together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much work to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts lie behind.
It is possible that the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We must now work at maximum speed,” said Ukrainian President Grigory Surkis.
"Uefa will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from this."
Several Premier League players had been sentenced to forced relegation for manipulation alone last season, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about privates - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her ex-Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
It foams - and strikes back.
Delayed Rose War with ex-husband Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said, “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud was only known after the divorce.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" was the occasion for the soul-striptease, which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Most incredible," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, that "Meg is repeatedly ruminating and re-enacting the history of our relationship."
It is also "unfortunate" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so conclude his admissions with the side-kick: "My life goes on anyway.
I feel fortunate to have a wonderful family who are doing well.”
Flight and hotel prices drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again – this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The Company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already become expensive.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year ago.
American Express sees the weak dollar price as the cause of this, which has led to a "decreasing desire to travel by American tourists".
Financial markets such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
Flight prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to kerosene inversion, travelers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, the price changes were much lower.
In Germany prices plummeted even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, while prices fell by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price drop is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, increases competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the cancellation of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the leader of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein increase crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was accurately formulated, it went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," Hermann Rieger whispered in the cabin aisle of the Hamburg Arena.
There wasn’t much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist at HSV for nearly three decades and enjoys a higher reputation than many of the past.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have sounded similarly: Here with gate two!
The implementation remained unfulfilled.
"It wasn't all nice to see today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked to be more relaxed.
The 1-0 (1:0) is due to Mladen Petric (11th)’s header; and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
“It was a dirty win,” Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash chart on the video wall, which showed their club as a class primus.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to classify that,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim testimonial stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as the Jansen recruited by FC Bayern - finds themselves slowly, but they are not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the vote defeat
On Wall Street, fear is over.
Initial news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily collapse by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss in a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
At around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer recorded a good five percent minus 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Goldman Sachs bank declined by almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds will be made available for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum is not to be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from the financial companies, which could be redeemed if price developments were appropriate, in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and USA in a downward trend
The billion-dollar grants to banks in Europe and the US do not resolve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and pulls the Dax down.
The US Dow Jones Index loses despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have lowered the German Stock Index (Dax).
Despite the bailout by the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost three quarters of its value at a time, with Commerzbank dropping more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and scored with a 3.7 percent downgrade at 5,839 points.
Stock markets around the world have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
In the MDax, Arcandor shares declined following the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark Matter Influences Flight of Spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused inconsistency: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite right.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Because fuel lines are soon freezing, you are now in danger of cold death.
For years, scientists have been confusing a mysterious phenomenon - the swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flying maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been astonishing for years: the missiles do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the ancient law of gravitation.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called him a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein did not err, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously emanates an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not emit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists abducted in Egypt are supposed to be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom money.
In a pre-release shooting, six hostage-takers are said to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media concordantly.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking her health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, along with their eight Egyptian companions, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It was “just about receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife to one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German intermediary, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the hijackers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Misuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led to a woman killing herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession, “I feel responsible for her death.”
The court learned that Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
While living in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he retired to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was being prosecuted for abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends said Ms. Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "gave up her life"
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I used to tie her up and tie her eyes."
“I didn’t force them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still, the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court had it not been.”
He added: “I note the impact, according to Stephanie’s father and mother’s description, their deed over the years had on their daughter.
She would otherwise have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials Responsible for Lost Data Will Be Indicted
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was seconded from the Department of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, “They thought it would be dealt with internally at the Department of Defense and the Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be named will be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published contained classified assessments of al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret location.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could face a cost of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, the director-general of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), said it was “unbearable” that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The $14 billion loan will eventually be repaid if Bradford & Bingley’s loans are paid off.
But the interest accrued in the meantime is credited to the 700 financial firms that accept deposits each year.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved cautiously ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay together about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
That means companies will have to raise <0xC2><0xA3>81 million for first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Societies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upsurge are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the records existed in 1945.
“We will be looking at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
Interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are bipartisan organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court denied bail regarding the charge of blackmailing 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her full freedom.
Correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release whether she will continue to be able to remain on her free foot when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not need to be granted bail, as she is already on suspension abroad to be treated abroad," her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court."
Their lawyers claim they need bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after Oct. 17, an Awami alliance party chairman said Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Concerns over the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations last week carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or impede the thousands of vaccination workers.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB’s share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully blocking NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB's purchase of the share in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications agency Ofcom have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing pressure on its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced it would give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in the U.S. Attorney’s Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special counsel to deal with the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the inspector general of the Ministry of Justice criticizing the actions of the administration employees.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officers interrogated during the investigation lied to investigators to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal proceedings, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors had been involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of Democratic election fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has come under fire because of the dismissals and has ultimately resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report critically addressed Gonzales’ role by taking “main responsibility” for the dismissals, “relinquishing” his leadership role and “exceptionally disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former senior adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize during the awards ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for this year's awards after coming into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such subjects as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 and reached number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscure street in the city, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Still, even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used passageway.
There are also no road signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It wants to pave Extra Place to create a clean passageway to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remnants of the past of the block of houses.
However, the City Administration Department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in preserving them.
During a meeting of the City Council Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the road remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the city council 3.
“Very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that they would re-pave the small street and set up seats designed, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the session this month.
Avalon Bay spokeswoman Michele de Milly said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main concern is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the road and stressed that the department’s task was to develop the properties rather than manage them.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock memorial, which closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public land, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a practically unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinct City"), has published part of the town's history talk about Extra Place, which was published in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and week-old newspapers flying past rain gutters.”
With a few exceptions, the road has looked exactly like this recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of outdated newspapers.
Some passersby said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be slightly polished.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: Education in an English-speaking environment
In this issue of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, Senior Research Fellow in California Studies and Senior Director in the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Choice".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of successful completion of school among African-American and Hispanic students is lower than among white students” — which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional phase in education for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children in their fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success was achieved by methods other than those favored by Obama.
Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, constant control of knowledge, and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of education in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should consider, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in technical instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national picture associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation aimed at “English-only.”
Instead, he said, “You’re supposed to make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close the gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets could not suffice to revive the economy.
Crude oil forward trading on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then climbed again as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors again showed concern, although congressional representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is still far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, Citigroup is said to be buying up Wachovia Corporation’s banking business, according to a government statement on Monday.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it has not managed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decline further.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank have written in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have downgraded its oil consumption expectations due to weak economic growth for the coming year and lowered its oil and gas price forecasts for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Homecoming defender Shaun Ellis thought he’d seen it all after running more often than anyone else in the jet jet over the past eight-and-a-half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphant move.
“I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Ellis said.
After a sluggish game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration made a huge leap forward.
Favre found Coles in that quarter for two more touchdowns, one of which slipped as an away defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half.
“I didn’t put much effort into it,” Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
We voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were catching, the defense split quarterback Kurt Warner.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis took a crashed throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and picked it up.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss from Warner.
The last ball loss, forced on Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot to 34-0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answer both, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time.”
Rugged Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown once again why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2 km track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he achieved at least one world championship title or a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, fearing that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions – at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish – Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched on long distances, the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result of 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusty.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great.”
He has been criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rival from East Africa – for overly orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records above competition.
But this criticism hardly hurts the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the track in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had subsided.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his final start to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, finished a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 is held by Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to issues described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has skilfully planned her run by first having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners torn out, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the exuberances of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first all-black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquettes, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city it describes – and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the Federal Writer Project at the time of the depression – is and remains in many ways a place of a very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, devoted and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t know what he misses.”
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about race relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
“We are very concerned about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a parishioner of the city’s oldest church.
It must be right.”
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the sometimes condemned, sometimes praised, black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on their guard.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in verbal form, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led Reader to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its neat gardens and playgrounds, which Howard Miller always cares about, though he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever-always-fits classrooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who perpetuated Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in trousers, in a city that even today imagines something about her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the residents were fascinated, while many scorned them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he waved in his chair, on a rearward terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books sold out.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there was no large memorial service, no public readings on a large scale.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage in the least,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the township.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting on the sidelines,” Mr. Franklin said.
“Once upon a time, there was a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to enforce integration, calling its decision in Brown’s case against the school council “insulting rather than respecting my race.”
Residents nowadays say that although the lifting of racial segregation was positive in some ways, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and they hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You didn’t hug your white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there’s a cultural divide there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped make room for more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who dismissed prejudices as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much acclaimed Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, and again made it a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
“The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, aroused real civil pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more trainees, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to re-appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on newly cobbled and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville is still a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It’s 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, pre-approval is required and certain things – such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field – may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival grew larger, an increased degree of homeland pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up like any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who might need some help, according to him.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,'" Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, we speak financial Latin fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have the worst day of horror work every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push the metal tea carts along pavements with loud clatter and carry trays loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roam between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around the 50 ironed T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like pole lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for themselves on the sidewalks on their breakfast bagel and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon due to all the downfall of the world.
Although I had decided to put my compulsory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists about the way to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, as I later learned from Starr, my "licensed personal bank employee", were for the same reason as I was in line.
However, unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, to places where they were commuting from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called “thrifts” (a little like a construction bank), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly and quietly bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion in savings, was looking for a saving buyer.
Fearful of another collapse, the office and store employees who were standing before me took their cash to a bank that is considered a safe harbor, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial Latino in recent weeks.
One woman, who was on the phone in my Chinese home supermarket, referred with so much familiarity to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and their skinny-looking CEO Dick Fuld, as if she were slandering a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, has diverted from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my grocery delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not taking a risk anymore."
Muslim graves defiled during right-wing slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a leftist of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of desecration at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend in which extreme right-wing parties recorded significant gains in the country's parliamentary election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials believe this is an attempt to disguise the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the news of the grave desecration that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan draws to a close.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the vote, campaigned for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign and some of their voting rights were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burqas, and even expressed his dislike for food commonly associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which say that the far right are the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges suspended Glitter for six months after informing the authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police were granted a travel ban last Thursday after they presented evidence to judges of Glitter’s convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford County Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning Law Firm.
A spokesperson for the Court reported: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police in Ashford District Court applied for permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad’s travel abroad to France and Spain by March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present in person.”
As required by the register of sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children at home and abroad.”
“In our view, it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“The Kent police’s primary concern is to protect the residents of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn’t comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in 1999 for 4 months in the UK for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Minister of the Interior Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
<0x60>I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen gaze or the expressiveness of the hands that are worried about not being able to enter the stage.
In his project <0x60>Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer depicts theatrical performances of several stage productions with singers, dancers and guitarists, of which he was still little known to the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, <0x60>reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing day by day,' the artist explains and makes it clear that <0x60>Flamenco-people' <0x60>any person can be, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.
Inspired by the festival <0x60>Cante de las Minas', Bauer set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images reminiscent of classical photography were created.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands flamenco: 'music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco personalities including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of the almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon be published as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and realize it as a ‘portrait of the veterans of sport’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the project <0x60>Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives to <0x60>I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today, entitled <0x60>Flamenco-people', is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is “a madness”.
He doesn’t yet know where the novel’s plot takes place and what it’s about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he’s working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he deals with is 'a madness' and 'everything indicates that he should not have to write the novel'.
<0x60>If I had been prudent, I would not have done it, but I will and hope to finish the novel at some point', so he ended his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of <0x60>La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the Hay Festival and to which most of the attendees gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of <0x60>Our mutual friend' and can be seen at the Theater Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had an audience in front of him who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humour, has not been given enough time to go through everything: how his vocation to literature, which arose from 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy at reading' and from 'he wants to make his work more intense,' and 'he wants to make his work more intense'.
The Hispanic-American novelist admitted that there is "no way" to measure and to know whether books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it does not "provoke" the "responsibility" of human beings, and asks for more "responsibility."
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with it: bullfighting festivals partially fell out.
After the announced bullfighters determined that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to inconstant weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadores consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>as and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut out three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening Alejandro Talavante struck two horns and one ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After having fought so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with buh cries.
In <0xC3><0x81>lava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Two policemen urged the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as reported by the Basque State Ministry of the Interior.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the <0xC3><0x81>lava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were passing through the urban area of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>on.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the control of the route. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the pursuit until after a few kilometers the car stopped at the edge strip, at which moment the drivers got out of the car to flee over a country road into a forested area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later forwarded to further police departments for precise laboratory analysis and weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials noted that the mark was ‘double’, so that it did not match the mark indicated in the car papers, which is why there was also an arrest for forgery of official documents.
The Ertzaintza city police continue the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the confiscated drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be presented to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for her role as Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A witness had watched her attempt to escape from her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, spokespersons for the California traffic police told People magazine.
The witness told in detail that Locklear “pressed the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.”
A little later, the witness, who at first probably hadn’t noticed the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby road and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was “fearful of Locklears.”
When the police arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street, blocking traffic.
“She seemed disoriented,” so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. <0x60>As a result of the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' according to the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and placed in local detention at around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the Arizona clinic after treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and a member of the United Left, today assured that the regional association for education will be the one that will make the decision in the case of the former city council for youth and sports of the city hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
"In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it," Llamazares pointed out, what approach the party must have towards the one who sits until now as a city councillor in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva could have begun: 'The VL always insisted that such cases obtain maximum transparency'.
In this regard, he stressed that education has "a strict ethical code for all public offices".
<0x60>Sangre de mayo': Heroes' Book by Garci
Inspired by <0x60>Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci presents in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros in investment for the filming.
In this way, the cineast has tried to "present a lot of personalities and social analysis", which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, explained Carci today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the beginning of a long directory of actors.
'Sangre de mayo', with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later on the Telemadrid station as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming, his 'Dream of Childhood' was fulfilled. This is what he owes Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a memorial film for the second-century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Mainly because the story was based on the 'Episo'es Nacional.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.'
However, the cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected, as in <0x60>Alatriste' or <0x60>Los fantastas de Goya' (twice as high as in <0x60>Sangre de mayo'), so that some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in <0x60>Volver a starter', has been involved in his ordinary way of working: he has been on the stage with the actors with whom one must first rehearse before one starts to shoot and for those who had not cast, he appeared <0x60>degrading' and giving respect, <0x60>a part of the profession of cinematographer, working in the cinematographer'.
Many actors he encounters in <0x60>Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (one of which he won), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither <0x60>Sangre de mayo', nor <0x60>Siete mesas de billar fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise' and finally not the selected film <0x60>Los girasoles' blind.
Garci is not expecting any awards for this film.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize that it’s only for prosperity, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville adores a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> Tórtola Ferrer) and the Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
Isabel Bayón fascinated the life of this woman who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.”
“We’re not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,” said the flamenco dancer.
Her dance bases have helped me a lot in flamenco.
“The Butterfly Dance” seemed to me like Guajira, or “The Snake Dance” like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,” she claims.
The production includes two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of her performances, as he did in ‘La porta aperta’; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally together with one of her ex-students.
<0x60>Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and the guitarists Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra J<0xC3><0xBA>arez, he <0x60>takes the role of the companion of the artists, the Divas were always in love.
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, because I think she is one of those women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no one can appreciate today and for that reason even less,” says Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book <0x60>Diario de un poeta lácido casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of <0x60>Diario de un poeta lácida casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the <0x60>Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón's Death Awards' (2006-2008).
Thus, <0x60>the triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the traveling exhibition <0x60>Juan Ramón Jiménez: <0x60>Aquel chopo de luz' is now presented in the Andalu, which was opened in May and, according to the New York.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of <0x60>Diario de un poeta neucia casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The U.S. can't imagine it without Paul Newman.
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing idea of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed it.
Look at how much it cost to give him the Oscar.
When he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, crying, “my life and my country were the greatest guiles of his life.”
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or exaggerate.
As the ‘father’ of the cinema and the homeland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the depressed self-esteem of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue few people remain to be admired, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, as well as various losses, profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift to the country, where it took a lot of effort to stand up to a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of astonishment strikes high above Hollywood regardless of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person has died, but the whole era.
English film director and Oscar winner Sam Mendes said working with Newman was no more or no less than the pinnacle of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The greatest of us all has left us,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining high standards of righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, although there were certainly many ways not to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?” he joked.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense if you were to look at the rating and I could check it out, if that clearly wouldn't have been the case.
But let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with picking up a ticket that allows you to be the first to leave.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you do it, then they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
Well, I don't.
Here they just let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is just going there for that) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The t-shirt was only in the size <0x60>S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like this are a small thing compared to the days on the road.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it was once successful, but getting them back would be even more difficult.
In addition, it looked like rain in these 40 minutes of waiting, so it was tempted to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people with pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for classification because of this chip that I got, I can already think that the output was incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect road, I would never think of this road.
So I think we will long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) receptionist
At the <0x60>Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, that is what a route planner hears about on campus).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can tell how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the key words of their conversation.
It can also organize the attendees into groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, <0x60>the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that that person is not part of the group that leads her conversation, and that he is not a company employee either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and replies that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about the change of strategy of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the necessities rather than filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
It's all just a statement, considering that in Windows versions, Microsoft added one or another feature and 'extras'.
The change of direction is worth it
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of one’s ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only booted to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day we spend more time surfing than in the ‘window’ area.
What is half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the machine: <0x60>Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for online searches.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had it in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', just like Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather', while it also belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we begin to list the innumerable appearances of stars, we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English speakers call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
Firstly, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle <0x60>Marcel'. Legend has it that the origin of the name is linked to sport and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
<0x60>La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cuts and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmeres, Cotton Pants, T-Shirts with Stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and wealthy girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris for the promotion of the company Mango, relocating there her residence and also makes the presentation of the most important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Mercyful and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of <0x60>Mango Fashion Awards' and attended the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dress up, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but finally, everything comes together in one and these areas have many things in common.
Ever since I was a kid, I’ve loved the clothes; I’ve always wanted to go to my grandmother’s to wander around my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you get into the real role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, you didn't fall into a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I feel better than ever when I’m 30 years old.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was little and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
I have known for a long time that I am going to be a mother because my body demands that and I also want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I don’t worry.
I will impart great feelings of happiness to my child and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as the art of film is concerned, you will keep in mind the works in which you participated and which were shot last year.
This is the case, and I would very much like them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that <0x60>La final hora' and <0x60>En busca de la tomb de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organization’s ‘Women for a Better World’ charity event and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our Mango collection were auctioned off to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
A lot of things are being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who may fall back due to alcohol levels will need to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol, installs this system in his car, which prohibits him from starting the car when drunk.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General’s Office. According to them, it is a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is to resocialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the Attorney General's Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers reported driving under the influence of alcohol more than once sat back at the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air, and prevents car start when the driver has done alcohol testing; or if an alcohol concentration is found to be higher than is allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the cost is borne by the one who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And to facilitate its implementation, a lawful reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process.
Still, the device is not available in the Spanish markets, in any store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed, with the Prince and Princess of Asturias traveling.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly at the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people with you at the airport at this time. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar and on the red carpet, including the military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, who give salves of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-waving hair, without ordinary peep-toes, perhaps was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, awaits them a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition <0x60>el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talent.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
Incidentally, this is the company’s second largest business in Europe and was recently opened, offering a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
There have been so many events associated with thanking fashion designer Valentino for chairing the jury at the competition, which ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with a heavy heart that was broken by the pain of his brother’s recent death, broke up. He put on the costume from the fashion house and wore some jewellery from ELAH, which were stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino to dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango House, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the Baron of Rotschild without jackets, for jackets they have lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hurried to the shop and had a trouser and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old times, took a pole and took a style.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a personality who always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own sheets and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not a thousand, but one more way to forget the chaotic, fast-paced everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all collected in a book that says how to get to relaxation. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment if it rings at 7 in the morning, but even worse, the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of turning off the world of work.
But the number is rising, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga sessions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott’s book presents the entire list of options adapted to each individual’s taste and time.
The work against stress is called <0x60>1001 ways to relax' and so the tranquility that the book conveys comes into the bookstores of the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, the methods of staying in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are offered.
When the adrenaline in your veins stops rising to restore balance and the stress has become a problem, the time has come to sit on the couch, turn off the brain, and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something about what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child cannot remember anything.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, connections are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (betting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that you speak quietly in single words, whisper or it can be quite the opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and seek advice from a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and arises in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to arouse the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are horrible and a little too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
If speaking occurs during sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear him out of sleep.
Even though the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if he shows up scared after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or find out what the reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it does not tell the child that you hear this at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses... at last
After a long thirsty journey, Illhäusern is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow-blacks gained numerous goal opportunities and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After an initial attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was close to the corner, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it was alternately possible to challenge the defence of Denmark first Fonderflick with a distance shot, then Brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi at the top of the storm through.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two goal chances won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which was exactly right to take back a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Ilhuesian goalkeeper should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which required his teammates to continue inferior in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems for an Illhaeusian eleven, who only withdrew a little to <0x60>compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, when the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him “with a constructive spirit,” and hoped that he would come with “concrete proposals.”
The President’s visit is taking place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, set up by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of on average over 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysée Palace press spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is resolutely expected by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvado, which caused traffic jams of almost ten kilometers in length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le did not break.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated by a blockade.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes in the Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the planned discussion at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
“The strike will continue” because “the fishermen will not give in at any point” and “do not want to go to Paris”, for example, announced Liliane Cariou, president of the fishing committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can be reached only with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.

Embraer keeps its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is delivering 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of Embraer.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider surrendering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Financial Times Sunday issue, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially backed by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering surrendering more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion it has been awarded.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of much of its business beyond its international life insurance and pension plans in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of AIG met Sunday evening to review possible sales.
At the AIG, no confirmation could be obtained.
Among the assets that AIG may be divesting from is its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT continues.
As regards these sales, no final decision has been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the over $85 billion loans granted to it by the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks, reported a historic fall in prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the decline in trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final shooting figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks, which was supposed to regain some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which was already battered at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 against, the MPs refused to finance Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture circulating that portrays Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project accepted in several days would be “too late.”
“If the project is indeed doomed to failure, it will soon be the task of the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza stressed, while stressing even more the sense of extreme urgency, that “every day that passes, brings the ruin of a financial enterprise” in the United States.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking business by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis was accelerating suddenly, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic necessities has grown strongly.
The revenues of the state treasury within ten years fell Friday night from 3.632 percent to 3.82 percent, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161 percent to 4.357 percent.
Obama wins points in first TV duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday followed another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the Republican and Democratic HQs in the election announced their own victory in this television duel, which was to be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, while quite handsome, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to stop his decline in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published a poll on Saturday that puts Obama five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is clearly the better figure.
Among the undecided voters, the ones that matter now, Obama emerged as the winner with 39 percent, while according to a CBS poll, 25 percent of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected from his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
"She has good instincts," Clinton said this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain never ceased to emphasize his undeniable experience in foreign policy, underlining quite clearly the “naivety” of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election advertising spots.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and accurately, without letting himself get out of the way.
He focused on his ability to make good decisions and renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, Obama has, on the other hand, already,” said a Democratic election advertising spot this weekend that accused Republicans of failing to capture the full extent of the crisis that is looming on the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election event in North Carolina in the rush of rain.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘middle-sized’ or ‘workers’. ‘The financial crisis is giving Obama, whom Americans think is best suited to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
After re-emphasizing that he would even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that creating a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully considered the questions raised by the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Have you noticed that an election took place in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of polling stations in the Minsk market square to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukashenko: <0x60>The dictator must resign'.
Some admit that they didn’t vote at all: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice?’ says a young woman.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to carry out a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including the non-issuance of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were deemed clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the census,” said Yuri Potemkin, a press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
When opposition members move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering in the political game, because “dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout appears to be too high, and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any type of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrats leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, the ones most likely to correspond to the ideas of the government.
The silence of the night descends again over Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - The Blood That Became Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
Above all, it has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at shedding light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and drawing up guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to submit his report, several provinces at the time set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society, to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood preservative system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
“Through the tremendous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and by working in this area over the following years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary maintains that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since 1998.
“And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which states that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself through a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was accepted from persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we have applied is quite meaningful.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for the detection of HIV was released on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case in the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time, which takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood cans before someone became infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 canned blood each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a canned blood.
I believe that nowadays you can feel comfortable getting a blood transfusion or prescribing it to restore health,” says the director of Hema-Quebec.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
It wasn’t until last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We need to monitor continuously,' Dr. Décary continues, before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies in addition to a safe supply.
“The demand is increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebec’s eligible blood donors.
Any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread will be excluded from donating blood for one year.
“With this 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most of all, to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood preserves, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
<0x60>A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
“We should probably start making it available early next year for transplants,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of cord blood removal as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it,” because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders in the second and decide game of the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final of the first league elimination games of the USL.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute.
After a first half without a goal for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the Montreal side.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that the first game of the pre-and-replay series on Friday, Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle, had a 2 to 1 loss.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete against the Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night, Thunder was able to make up a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victory goal by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panthers with a stormfire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the match, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory match, the fourth of the Tricolores in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warned the Russian.
I need a game to make me feel good.”
“He was too fixated on it in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.”
Charest relies on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out starting elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s by-election.
<0x60>Delaying the course of our last great border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines entirely.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in ‘Google Maps’, maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
Speaking to the press, the prime minister refused to rule out holding the elections this fall, even though he said his schedule was very busy.
The 'Plan North' is the fourth element of a 'vision' that the Prime Minister supposedly has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area' that provides for an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches lately, the opening of the North – the northern area at 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, confined himself to explaining why the North is “a jewel of enormous potential,” but did not mention a date, investment sums or precise priorities for upcoming projects.
At most some perspectives on what more could be worked on: especially in water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's enumeration, the North possesses 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This <0x60>area twice as large as France' <0x60>is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only close to us, it is within us," he stressed, as if to clearly show that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude pursued by all governments.
"There is a border line at which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Furthermore, “with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North,” he explained, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable throughout the year due to the melting of ice.
Against this new geopolitical backdrop, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
What about the inhabitants of the area, the Native Americans and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecist deputy of Ungava) have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
A committee of ministers led by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) plays an important role, has started the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, “not necessarily a summit,” but an opportunity to “create a common vision.”
The development of the North will, moreover, be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it were a continuation of those liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
By the way, this was one of the repeatedly raised topics of the weekend, which opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the adopted decisions is to rename the Beauharnois power plant to the Adélard Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Charest said.
To the press he referred to another, this time conservative, project, namely the “Roads to the North” program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Regarding the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam project, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
“This remains among us, but I intend to be there,” he confided to his party members, which evoked those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, mainly due to a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of 'constitutional goals', which were easily adopted: the PLQ especially calls for the recognition of 'Quebec's speciality' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition took the guidelines of the Plan North with scepticism.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasized the policy for the development of Northern Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done so, “we would have gone much further today,” Ms. Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has called for support for the government’s adoption of a plan North.
“But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big show,” party leader Sébastien Proulx said in a statement on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-Justice Minister (which irony) in Harper’s Cabinet was the one who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a “shame” for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover up with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as she does about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that was not the only one from all the countries concerned to bring home her compatriot captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things happened that were accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who turns to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will surely be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a treacherous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so insignificant from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no morality at all: you can arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, according to the opinion of a head of government, who is still only supported by the minority (may he belong to the minority after October 14th...).
Many voters believe they find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has given up on what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this loss, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a libel lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small destitute publishing house, with the aim of opening a ‘public transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge on the truth, especially not in the case of slander lawsuits, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely obscured by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposing opinions.
No matter how the process runs out, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a consensual arrangement that silences the opposing side and also deters anyone who dares to re-consider the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things in front of public opinion.
Contrary to what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold operates, debates in Canada are usually conducted by exchanging ideas rather than sticking.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had unveiled its books and files and opened up a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes out the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time and yet disregard the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice President, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada is doing so primarily because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag lawsuit (in the course of the ‘public debate’ Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada that they no longer use this term...).
Aside from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth-finding that is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to cope with debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it pretends, it does not want a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to curb this type of unjustified lawsuit.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main contents are: better control of MEPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to curb the number of houses seized due to arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Rep. Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon.
“We have made great strides towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the past two hours, fearing the impact that a further failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who were late in the negotiations, were more likely to support the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain injunctions to the agreement, especially those that should allow owners to keep their homes, and those that concern the salaries of the executives of the companies rescued by the state.
“If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain people, that is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he said on American television.
When asked on another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guidelines I have read [show] that this is one thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards taxpayers’ money.
It comes 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgages (subprimes) before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAAs), and eventually led to a freezing of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican MPs who failed last week’s first attempt at an agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain "toxic" assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed that they escape the dead end.
To round off the viewpoints for everyone in Congress, an order has also been added that if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, it could then levy new taxes in order to regain its capital used.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of $250 billion, to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion must be approved in a new vote by Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which will pay him dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell back when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of stopping the garnishment procedures for the apartments linked to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as setting deadlines for repayment and compensation to be paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on it today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all her efforts, it is not yet certain that her plan will get a green light.
In fact, more votes were raised yesterday against this project, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House Financial Committee, told voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to pay the tax.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called the “Caucus of Skeptics,” represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us to let us know: we ask Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider which path to take,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe once again received proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying its competitor, who is in great difficulty since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we get a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are looming.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was just about to nationalize another bank brought into distress by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trump, nobody would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity and obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last American cinema icons of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his spectacle, certainly also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the blowing up of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From his European roots one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him a whole country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected, in the fighter who was injured in the war in the Pacific, who studied acting art in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success in theater, television and soon also in cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in the 1979 24-hour race of Mans, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a showcase relationship.
With him also disappear the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive star to the glamour of the show business, whose riddles can never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put movie lovers in a mood this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of ever-changing American film art passes by with him.
Then again the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Sheet Metal Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, who was reprised after his death and made the Newman famous in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), who was awarded the Oscar for best film in 1973.
A fierce and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen’s The Hustler (1961).
That face through the ages, that was him.
Still him.
In his résumé, epochs unite.
The youth know him most from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends who retired early enough from the film world, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his overly expressive achievements.
It wasn’t always easy for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he played less often Sunnyboys than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or the desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slippage and his rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensibility.
His 1968 novel Rachel, based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence, starring his wife Joanne Woodward, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honors that erupted over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift, is now going there.
We have probably often seen him stand with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although we still found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the point of being shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: “Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, negotiations begin in the criminal trial against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
In particular, the accused are accused of involvement in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent harm and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including falsification of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds lucrated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often documented with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are supposed to have flowed partly into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, when obtaining the tender money, fictitious invoices were submitted, and the clubs should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, a large part of the bills were counterfeited.
The bill blocks were bought at the Józsefváros market, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados was sent by János contract.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He demanded consumption invoices in order to be able to issue invoices for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the Budapest self-government.
The majority of these bills are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer restaurant.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the head of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently no limits set when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company whose accounting records of clients Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá did not appear at all, according to the prosecution.
As CEO Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that they were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the public prosecutor during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly affixed to the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people, after having a total of eleven rooms that offer impossible space for so many people, was also wrong.
Food was also mentioned on the invoice, while the restaurant had not been in operation for a long time.
The frequent counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency targeted by them only offers trips abroad, and so they indicated Hungarian trips on the cash invoice, which also contradicted the accounting practice of the company.
As the investigation has revealed, they have also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, since the company invoices only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the employees issue only machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "invoice handlers" was that in one case they had indicated "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the investment consulting company, the prosecutor's office said.
Further form errors - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, as well as to XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeit.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors confirmed that they had never issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been committed by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza: This company was in dissolution at the time (2001), namely just when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was said to have eaten there - the mass administrator consequently stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously Fake
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware of the fact that they had to lay fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
The Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said not to have provided the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was also no payment transaction, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the parties had forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company that can’t be found there.
In the period from October to December 2005, the company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components worth a total of HUF 18 million.
According to the investigating authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, who was also to receive the company documents from Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigation, Kubatov confessed to having issued invoices in the name of the GmbH. to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány and to have collected their equivalent value himself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian masons on the express wish of Iván Kubatov.
In reality, however, none of these companies were active, which was allegedly due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company’s founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the surcharge, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices in total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT each.
Kubatov even allegedly misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but they did not use these amounts for their own purposes.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices of Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to confess to the procedure of the counterfeiting of the accounts, as they were already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János decides to make a full confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether, in return, Zuschlag is willing to assume responsibility.
It is quite possible, however, that Zuschlag now plays the "insulted" after his requests for the mitigation of the imprisonment and house arrest were encountered on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not compensated them, are on their own, or at least under house arrest, supplement is denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Overbidding – Or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people don't want to give up in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases the subjects' active brain regions were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
In both games, participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain bark, was measured in auction losers, in which overbidding the opponent plays a significant role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally carried out investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised a $15 reward in case they emerged as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on the one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to higher stakes than those in the control or "win" group.
“These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have justified the behaviours observed at auctions so far only with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated at one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver disease caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to vaccinate against viruses A and B, in any case, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur about two to three weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
Afterwards, the jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die each year from the much more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten people infected is on drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is therefore essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooists.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banning the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this virus-induced chronic liver inflammation, its formation and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious belief acts as a kind of “pain medicine” that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been studied to what extent faith in God influences human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the test, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electroshocks.
Participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would provoke a kind of religious trance among the faithful, while choosing da Vinci’s image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as reassuring.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electroshocks in four stages during this time, while they were to view either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were “cared for” and felt “rest and peace.”
While viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that you could also evoke similar effects with other, powerful images also among the atheists, you just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," he said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains, what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of its tenth birthday, Google can rightly say: it is found in people’s pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of Google.
Towards skeptics plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he directs: These would overlook just the essence of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “sorting all the information in this world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of collecting information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What job is really right for me?” but software programs were not yet able to do so because they did not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later to use it, so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data misuse - "If you look at what I am doing" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that has arousal of fear, and less the sense of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the contest against the power that many Internet users reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also made it possible to identify the pedophilia.
However, users concerned about personal rights were able to breathe in in May, when Google successfully brought against the FBI in court together with the civil rights organization EFF: accordingly, Google can continue to be forced to release information to the FBI on a secret request without any point of the Constitution in the future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but the list of individual users, or their list of web and search terms, was withheld for two months retroactively.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: Those who reluctantly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services scourge the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture" that is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even though they are both fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require its users to identify codes, and provides its services free of charge, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package seems far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the software giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the fore, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, i.e. users deliberately leave tracks and take advantage of the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teen can manage their profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, they can connect to each other through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and they can finally integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and they can also run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries, which are on Flickr or Picasa geo.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove it: when looking at last night's party photos, the friend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is fired because he is only too honest about the management of his blog - one thing is for sure: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals of himself - in this way, about, one could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can gladly do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that does access Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people intentionally do not register on community sites so that they cannot be found, but Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
Public opinion is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the ever-increasing services provide not only Microsoft, but other software developers as well.
Critical viewers, however, also find the troubling counterpoles: for example, the corporate management has completely rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of the company's kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management said that the multiple meals of the employees was too expensive. But all this seems to be almost mildly against Google's anti-filter in 2006, the regime was in favor of a good agreement, and even those were in favor of the K.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could turn around a lot more vigorously: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, so others are completely aware of the problem because of the system.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database is already providing the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance - for example "Scroogled", Cory Doctorow's famous novel depicts in the best Orwellian way a future in which a human being becomes appallingly close thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two young people help the double killer of <0xC3><0x93>zd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of having helped in the removal of the traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were decent, they are currently being charged with aid.
According to the news agency MTI, they are two girls who are defending themselves on their own.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of having intentionally murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old owed a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor last Wednesday to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the crime by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Announces Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, has been offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell more than 60% of the shares in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily "E15", the offer of the Poles contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kronor.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers on Tuesday already spoke of “September 11”.
We owe the global financial catastrophe to the American president, for example, “La Repubblica” said – the president had not even been able to put his own party behind the bill that should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second 9/11.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not have any political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Day Indicator" says.
While some states could still provide their shaken financial institutions with bailout packages, and save the banks with taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are going to fail, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "Der Standard" recalls. Moreover, according to the newspaper, the concerns are increasingly realistic that after the Americans, European taxpayers now also have to reach into their pockets a little deeper to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the “saviors” would not have to “whale” with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies for accident prevention, if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented that inspired bumblebee’s Nissan engineers to create new accident-preventing systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C auto-robot-controlled biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval “private area”, which is very similar to our own “protection shield”, Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of view within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-preventing process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the auto robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by rotating the tires at the appropriate angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the robotic vehicle wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Vehicle Project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the avoidance, unlike the bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the tires.
While there are infinite possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use rotary motion, or acceleration and deceleration, in the auto robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It does not have to store them or produce an intuitive, logical response from previous maneuvers, so it only requires a handful of KB of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte of memory.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to the destination.
A Name for the Sinful Child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion bailout package law, which will be applicable in several stages and aimed at buying the banks’ bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended Saturday after midnight local time on the East Coast, congressmen after multi-day debates to reach an agreement on the $700-billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We've made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the deal should only be put to paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package was supported by both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will have an impact and it will be efficient, but we need to do even more, not to save Wall Street, but to tear the economy down.”
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first votes on the 2008 draft law to stabilize the economy, then the Senate is in charge.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion be spent at once on the purchase of lazy, loan-laden securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion will be spent, with $250 billion available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday, which will be spent on the purchase of credit-burdened, bad securities, and the next $100 billion will be decided by the president.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: It can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As the responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrisome funds, and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the means necessary to provide up to $700 billion in emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now dependent on state aid can expect that their clearances, which are called "golden handshake" in the overseas slang, will be cut by the government.
Salary cuts will only occur in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance is helping each other.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, then the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the destitute banker is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managerial salaries are not overstated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not being changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that managerial salary cuts are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for the taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank are better off.
The bill requires the president to make a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how to get taxpayers back their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect of us, the plan is not protecting taxpayers’ money at all, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, down 3.9 percent from the previous year.
Due to domestic and export price changes, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices have increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 percent.
Also, the selling prices of the manufacturing industry have increased only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 per cent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 per cent, for footwear prices rose by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials have driven up prices for chemicals and productions significantly (1.6 percent).
Prices declined in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in the paper industry, as well as in the publishing and printing industries remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
Looking at the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
Price declines were observed in the textile industry (2.5%) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3%).
The extent of the increase in other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water were up 18.7 percent year-on-year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in August in the investment goods sector (0.7%).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sectors they remained the same compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and reuse sector (16.8 percent) compared to the same period in 2007.
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, there was a price increase of 6.8 percent and a price reduction of 1.4 percent for investment goods.
Export prices of the industry measured in Forint rose by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, but there was a 3.9 percent decline year-on-year.
The domestic currency grew by 1.7 percent compared to the euro, 7.1 percent to the dollar, and by 7.5 percent compared to the August 2007 rate, even by 15.9 percent compared to the euro.
No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around Jan. 12, the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In her view, "it now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in time."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her the "Middle Cross of Merit with a Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the finance minister's resignation.
Congress and government officials have announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the bank bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s Hoch, which gave him the presentation of vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, has also melted down.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would swiftly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and be responsible ... - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are under threat," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to describe McCain’s economic visions as “obsolete.”
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We’re all going to have a hard time doing this, but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control committee for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definite role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within the camp became more confident - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co. are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's revolution destroys her fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over its offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epochal break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already pretty exactly ten years ago: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU reached 47.7 percent and fell below the 50 percent mark for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, still in the much-cited Stoiber era.
Consistently implemented by the CSU in the federal state, the modernization has finally wiped out their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time estimated themselves considerably at the pace, but without impact the secularization, the educational successes, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria to the loyalty of the CSU voters could not remain.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact – only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classical citizen groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with high school degrees.
Here the support of the CSU dropped to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily newspaper reports in its article "Who with whom? Party leaders restrained in coalition issues" on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it’s all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly let them look in their cards.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as vice chancellor, Faymann left open.
As he said, voters would have voted out the Schüssel-Molter course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, however, has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes in opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally at the ÖVP.
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Equal Opportunities Summit began, which will be hosted this year by the country of the Presidency of the European Union, France.
In her speech to the plenary, L<0xC3><0xAD>via Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People’s Party, drew particular attention to the issue of education segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that affects Roma children, and it is also the greatest obstacle to their need for enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency of the Council, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and citizens in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would be displaced mainly because of their low educational level from the labour market.
"The vast majority of Roma youth do not have intermediate education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher education degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that has a key role to play in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
In the view of the MEPs, it is important that a widest possible circle - that is, Roma and non-Roma - be aware of this.
For the earlier a Roma pupil starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and by means of income and sales tax they make their contribution to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be stopped," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a common, objective and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of de-segregation in the education sector and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
“We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully entitled citizen,” Járóka said.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace in Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are rolling at the moment, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the personnel debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their posts, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic loss of 17 percent of the vote will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party congress.
The much reviled duo, however, already showed that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
With this they want to appease the annoyed faction and the party base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a “single-ruler” in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the Conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the party internal restructurings, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which leads exploratory talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing "free voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
It is an irony of fate that with the list of “free voters”, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stoipers first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo in order to mercilessly dismiss the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, is playing an active role in this transition process, calling 28 September the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU deserved far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to success at the national level in 2005, is not put back on its feet with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment at the fiasco, believes that the loss of CSU terrain will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MP was able to enter the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegal counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature of the 10-million-strong state has been without opposition for decades, the opposing party, which has gathered under the name "Unified Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections, earnestly hoped that Lukashenko, who in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "release some of the president's mandate" for the fourth time.
That is why the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent thanks to the rising prices on the import of natural gas from Russia. For the alleviation of the price increases, even loans have been taken, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country, to the Russians. So in the background of the expectations of the opposition there was the hope that the Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU because of the anti-political opposition.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD’s election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was on the positive moves rather than the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report criticized the campaign - according to which opposition members are not expected to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper forms an independent federal state, has considered the two territories as a month.
“We have taken two steps forward and one step backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave even one oppositional in parliament".
The opposition does not plan protests in the light of the results, but rather tries to make the need for economic reform clear to the voters.
"We are struggling here with many problems - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the way of distributing stones, but nevertheless I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said, referring to the fact that not even the most supported stratum of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only safety is production.
“Thanks to the country’s indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the ‘social security’ warning the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe in deeds, not words." The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are revolving doors for the entrances and exits of officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those sludge eggs that first stamp and then go to drink coffee during working hours.
The new “anti-fault” law was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
"Rollable doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
“A new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,” Brunetta stresses once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the installation in all the buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of revolving doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissants.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Higher Committee on Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announced that "within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 more people are present at work per year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
According to the minister, “their wage dynamics have been twice as large as the private sector over the past 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate.”
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the Codacons-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles himself with figures on lower absences at work - so writes the Consumer Central - the people of 'active laziness' are growing uninterruptedly.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the Decree.”
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) fights for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2,500 accidents occur at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th National Day for Victims of Work Accidents in all the provinces of Italy, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace is," confirmed the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to the protection of injured workers, to aid the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outraged 'Basta' has arisen on this; understandable in tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some vortices in the media and participation of the public. But the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness in school settings by young people who feed on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness. A legislative norm must be put in place and improved.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency that offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data on workplace accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasizes Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you think that you are basically doing too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting out in school.
"Another effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is required.
Mercandelli also spoke of the "progressive deterioration of the protection of victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system that we have been fighting against in recent years".
The aim is therefore to provide the worker with a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not become dependent on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislature.
MP3 Player Under Charge: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time using portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing impairment.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the EU’s Csrseri (scientific committee on current and recently identified health risks).
“It is clear from the report that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than an hour a day are at risk of permanent hearing loss.”
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people, who usually turn on portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings - it is said on the part of the EU - there is a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise awareness among consumers and to make this information a communal asset.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"The scientists - this is the conclusion of the EU communication - confirm that one is rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU Members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to be able to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise.
These damages can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise setting.
In its report, the scientific committee of the EU points out that if users of portable music devices only listen to loud music five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line of music risk complete hearing loss within five years.
This is 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start of the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, we're going to take stock in June.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome, which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Caracalla Baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it", - stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains with the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no reallocation of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a certain end point in time.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
If you question the Commission's competence because of its lack of commitment, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will do and the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective.”
"This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to enable our city to make a leap in quality – which it really needs – and thus to take a joint step into the future.”
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself within the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician who is keen to be seen as independent has written: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the U.S. economy and maintained ties with the enemy Islam (and still does so as a private person today).
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, right now that the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very brazen: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!
Actually, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win with a great advantage.
Also in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a US mentality that was kept hidden until the last time.
“Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our creaks, whether for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people here who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now when the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the ultimate weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains Bush’s weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nonetheless, they did not say that they were really concerned about the general credibility of the information concerning those responsible.
You don’t feel as lonely as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the journalists interviewed – if you want to prevent traditional journalism from shrinking substantially, as the large public understands it.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and senior executives of the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, executives are even at 65%.
Printed vs. broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is heading.
The major publishing groups are paving the way for the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to wanting to join the new technology in the hope that "it will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editor-in-chief at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work".
The company managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
For journalists it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", note d. red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations, and internet operators, employers offer it as they please and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors in chief often receive very high wages, while the editor can sometimes receive only 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing gets complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach after a certain number of years 15 holiday days.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" throughout the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a mandatory stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the prosecutor’s office had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to obtain indictable evidence from him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion savings package of the White House: a large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s issue of the New York Times, which reports how the ongoing crisis is dividing the Republican Party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to “those in Washington” and the financial world, and especially the central and central states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example just mentioned, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake heralds or even represents already: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond, will be affected by these.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events, which are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unprecedented renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage a tremendous amount of the assets of private households residing in a single state.
This represents an immediate political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis thus appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen into disrepair and lost its right to speak: the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two not to be overestimated prerequisites – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization or market will be able to resort in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the national-state element, is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, just now, when we were so convinced that we had long since entered a networked world, a world of ever-differentiated technologies, of the immaterial, we must at once determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place in the world to another, they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Hence, the person who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a land free of oil or water or in a land without crop yields.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief introduction.
Whoever says territory, whoever says government, whoever says politics, whoever says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and in a sense still troubling aspect: a loss of trust, a lack of patience, an image of inconvenience, a feeling of distance, all directed at a whole class of managers of Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large sections of the population that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is represented by the majority as becoming more foreign and more outdated.
The demand for leadership, therefore, subterraneanly nurtures a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in the unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden change of the right of the collective state of mind of recent times, perhaps by the United States of America (beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Germany and the United States of America).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, have more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening today in the lower social strata of the West and is further reinforced and pushed by the financial crisis to superdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “rebellion of the masses”.
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that goes up on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which has now apparently almost reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already in use, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a row of spaghetti tubes arranged in a stack,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the geckos’ feet, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
Tests using various materials, such as glass teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability of reptile feet to hold and at the same time "easily remove from the wall," said Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe it is, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further applications could fall into the field of space travel.
For now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER WAY OF RESEARCH – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new kind of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that cleans itself from dust by moving like hair on a surface, always maintaining perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed especially in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage when taken with certain vital drugs, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of packaging and fresh fruit juices associated with taking medication. He again raised the alarm that a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medicines and to reduce the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthma drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
In a report two years ago, the same drug agency warned doctors and patients of the dangers of this mixture, and stressed that they should be careful about what is being drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepam or methadone.
It’s not just a GRAPHIC – according to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, director of the Universit<0xC3><0xA0> Statale di Milano, said: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, do not be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor, "emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to US history than the attacks.
A prediction that received not a few polemics in response and was presented to the economist even years later, but today proves to be completely correct.
“I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist” but also a banaliser with a “very aggressive style, especially directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package will be released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new open office is now presented to the public with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more Spartan-designed initial menu, a compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x has finally been achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the new standard ISO.
Eight against was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which, for example, makes it easier to send them via email. This includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, it is now possible to generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple hands by different users, which avoids conflicts when changes occur; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a fraction to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are in the process of publishing various OpenOffice features on the internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result is expected to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Apart from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
While free of charge may be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is precisely in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims at a displacement of Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases in place of the more familiar access; and lastly Draw, a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case is opening up within the framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is third-ranked and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver to be tested positive for Cera, the third generation Epo, previously the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-tests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and according to the Associated Press also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME INTRODUCTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION: IS ITALY RASISTIAN?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a lengthy article devoted entirely to the subject of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he stole a package of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the “paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those with “the most integration and job opportunities” and yet “the highest level of anti-immigration sentiments and the greatest support for the Lega North.”
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also underline the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of the up to 900-euro per room high rental prices
The student housing market has no crisis.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits, with large numbers of students actually losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level," said Laura Mariani, head of Sunia, "in these cities, the high demand on the part of the students leads to a distortion of the market, which has also harmed the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, illicit sub-rents.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices through a revision of the taxation.
If you take a closer look at the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed around 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends at 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera districts or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping space costs on average 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros are for a bed of necessity, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>.
Only those who dodge outside can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: renting that is 25-30% above the average is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historic cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image by director Giuseppe Tornatore is an effective description of what is currently happening in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means in the long run death for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend with whom you’ve covered a piece of street full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, which won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It’s the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia for living in a world that is probably lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the enormous number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these miners paid for the majority of the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The regions most affected include Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has evolved in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures are also created, but the first is the preservation of the already existing, because if a hall closes in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here still remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from an ethical and moral point of view that the government fails to observe the existing laws.
To maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be necessary.
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, due to fears about the old cinemas, decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy that aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax provisions for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public with regard to local transport: it will be possible to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a welcome initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
Of course, we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of multiplex rooms, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside so that I do not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group.
The accusations by the Calabrian Anti-Mafia Lawyer against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia businesses, are serious.
In handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for advisory activities."
According to the judges, this made it possible for the mafia group to officially enter the town halls and to participate in the policy of the public administration.
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who keep a white vest."
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the Piromalli clan was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, has been elected as the head of the centre-right coalition after the vote in May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He sued Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges say in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an interrogation action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur, known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has been shown – thus making the actions of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the big ones run up.
It is a non-fading source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now do the world’s big energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be met by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would be equal to twice the amount of energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are also the currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in the north of Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy sector are now relying on marine energy generation.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesman of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is weighing the possibility of collaborating with us.”
This is about obtaining an authorization from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that the U.S. continues to pump oil in Alaska, and President Bush has only recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York-based Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey-based Ocean Power are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about increasing interest.
technologies that can be improved.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in the making, not least since the last doubts from environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are rather small in size and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats by means of pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval, and some of the energy obtained could also be used for military installations.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using subsea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator as a result of the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, special interest deserves at the moment the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely tidal energy that has led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
