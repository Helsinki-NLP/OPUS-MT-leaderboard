Rapidly progressive cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare further for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8am.
These data were used to assess trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported from each country by March 15, 2020 at 8am, and compare it with Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
By 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy three weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being in different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their peak capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a 90% higher risk of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available in the Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes Nomenclature 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s example and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical assistance, mainly intensive treatment, as occurs in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to an mitigation approach, as the predicted rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their actions properly, if not implemented anteced.
Rapid risk assessment also outlines public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which develops rapidly.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to be confined throughout the holiday and for several subsequent weeks due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus bears great resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the respective disease was named CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients killed.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number one,” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 with SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we find twice highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third epidemic of CoV in documented human history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the contagion of health professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transport disrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the site of onset of contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has spread to China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation rapidly worsens, the scale and final severity of the epidemic must still be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed patients with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age range 30 to 65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 was given an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike glycoprotein (S) binds to its angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and subsequently membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the same original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was found that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the human ECA2 protein weaker than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of human ECA2 of full length at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the virus from bats to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated-snouted mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-Co-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are expected (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are efficient in deactivating the virus.
Overall, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Overall, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host’s innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptor (TLR), type NOD receptor (NLR) and type RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in cell defense.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including complements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the onset of symptoms in a group of people, more affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential for health authorities to adjust the actual quarantine time based on the most precise incubation period, thereby preventing infected people who do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As usual, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended by 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis by imaging of the lung, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilatory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which consists of the highest mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnoea (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilatory support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality up to November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the basic reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and with SARS-CoV regarding its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually happens in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzyme and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of the D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and have bilateral irregular shadows or matte glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest X-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumotic peeling, hyaline membrane formation, infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was not derived only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to arrive at an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a complex measuring rod at less than one hour.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while at the same time trying a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviating symptoms and saving lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an alternative modified cardiopulmonary technique used for the treatment of severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine cascade results from the exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat the cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulating the immune response directed to T cells; blocking IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibiting JAKs, blinatumomab; suppressing cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, drastically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of corticosteroid treatment at low to moderate doses were recommended for cautious use in severely ill patients with COVID-19.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-band RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China to perform some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are long-awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have healed from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, cured patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19, and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is large to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat an epidemic of global proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend greatly on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, obtained the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and co-workers published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the times required for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and for hospitalization were considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated by Western medicine alone.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated by Western medicine alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated by Western medicine alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still await further properly controlled testing at larger scales and at more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
What’s more, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychosis symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people with suspicion of the disease and people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain from animal and infected reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before the start of a clinical trial.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the VOCs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical progression, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-deficient areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not require intensive care (mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive treatment are more likely to suffer an acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ECA2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammation or lesion in the tissue and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also aid in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressively present in various organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Primary clinical symptoms: chest X-rays and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for the prediction of COVID-19 outcomes/complications.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants normally used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dosage and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from elevated stress as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the death of loved family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early phase of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring at the initial stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of stopping transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the deceleration phase will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle horn smears of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified could become a cyclical flu-like episode.
However, promising indications have occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
It was originally predicted that Ebola would cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the rigid quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in terms of infectivity and at some point become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS can be found below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being carried in the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of virions of 10 nm to 80 nm size, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, and the two are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should wear insulation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when serving patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay at home in isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
One meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major alert for China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproduction among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
That message left people more relaxed, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for curbing the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was missed.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public pronouncements, as everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to publicly targeted health care responses from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal statements from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic and periodically targeting the public at its earliest stage.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of SARS return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women, and severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which results in greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic counterpart has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission effectively, and the epidemic could reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or have seasonal recurrences like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild illness, such as a common cold.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics have changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put CoVS in the spotlight again and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of enormous use.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigating the interactions of the CoV host in animals can also provide important information about the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is what we do of comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current CoV disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positively polarized viruses and single-band RNA.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses have been called "CoVs" due to their corona morphology when observed under an electron microscope.
As for structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the genus betaCoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have steadily crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the coryza of patients with a common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating today and has infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well-adapted and non-pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trend of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of strain B814 of HCoV-229E from corita from patients who contracted a common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiologic agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the onset of the peak viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of patient zero traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The symptoms of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore quite peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases, of 34.4%, which has made MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the lethality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the lethality outside this city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as do SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of progression of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit seasonality, as in the case of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and people who develop serious illnesses of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have circulated in human populations, causing common colds in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seize the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired on a community basis.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediary animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a direct-relationship ancestor, sharing high nucleotide sequence homology.
The ancestral virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts the HCoV in a continuous and long-lasting manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt adequately to the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then transmit it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection stopped if it fails to sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm vines (Paguma larvata) and a guaxinim dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was reported after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild or farm masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the intermediate amplifier host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate host amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV named Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, with the exception of the designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from fecal samples of bats uses ECA2 from bats, civetes and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of convalescent SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor with the closest relationship to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to homologs in bat betaCoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, much like camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal smears, adding to the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that the symptoms usually mild, but with massive transmission of the virus, were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus transmission in bats.
However, responses are still lacking, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be plausibly attributed to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be configured among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They group into SARS-CoV-2-like virus sublinings in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In huge contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently, there is no evidence to confirm the direct origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to the divergence in sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related betaCoVs.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of pangolin betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A contrary argument is in favour of the recombination between betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (CoV of Appalachian Ridge) detected in the North American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also suspicion that camelids are its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs from closely related HCoV-229E bats have been discovered.
Among them, there is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs from HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alphaCoVs from alpacas have caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas obtain HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV from humans cannot be excluded.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by later results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV in dromedaries dates back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a mild disease and sustains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus by slaughtering and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in the virus are important in facilitating COVs to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-band RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the CoVs can be considered from "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even infeasibility.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir suppresses CoV replication by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is low, apparently, suggesting its higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, tape exchange often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as SL-CoV of bats and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of SARS-CoVs from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
Overall, the DLR on the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in amino acids 318o to 510o in fragment S1, which binds to human ECA2, as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and guaxinin dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from the human and civet viral isolates in DLR, and four of them are located at the receptor binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of its protein S to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electron cryomicroscopy indicates a 10- to 20-fold greater affinity of this bond than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other co-receptor may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and the natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp the host dependency factors and subvert the host constraint factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Non-tendentious genome-level screening of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology may yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: back to zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A feature of exclusion of nucleotide 29 from SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with lineages of alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, in most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV went through recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of selection pressure exerted on viruses, such as host immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpaca alphaCoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure on their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural exterminating cell inhibitor receptor, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exorribonuclease review, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of proteins or new protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or at most cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without eliciting a high immune response from the host.
This document explains the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from VOC replication.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the inflammatory syndrome NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While bat betaCoV has been found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals on the markets harbor SARS-CoV-identical viruses, the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is accidentally or intentionally man-made.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in these markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple pangolin betaCoV strains closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and the mode of such transmission.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are nearly identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and constitutes a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a commentary on our guide and provided the latest "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" diagnostic criteria according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called the coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the constant discoveries of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven issues with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a commentary from Zhou et al., who presented a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your significant work and express our gratitude.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an item of epidemiological history elements with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 last symptoms (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms have been confirmed in or from Wuhan areas of the city
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features for COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count exhibiting normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspicious case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome four times exhibiting high homogeneity in relation to the new known specific coronavirus recovery; (3) positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in the serum-positive or SAG-positive phase above the serum-CoV- or anti-positive phase; or any alteration of the anti-positive to the serum.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (January 27, 2020 and February 8, 2020, respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasingly evidence that reminds us to pay attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we look forward to the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and obey the latest guidelines from your home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest number daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported yesterday that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11.
A hospital agent told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, the Bengali minister of road transport and bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide has risen from one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
That milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said by Thursday it was one of the few countries left free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. in Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced tougher measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the duration of the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day, previously only from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand plans to roll out curfew from 10pm to 4am
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Shops in Australia Reduce Limits on Toilet Paper Per Transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and one package per transaction at every store in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a one-packet limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases with home delivery to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction on four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still depleting stocks in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales saw a "slight increase" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
Costco’s Canberra store also limited the allowable quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra inventory, while ALDI made stocks available in advance of a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local board restrictions on the frequency of truck deliveries make it harder.
He expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to carry out the promotion on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the sense of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if there were an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be [bought] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain supply, according to a report by News.com.au.
Real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to first bidders at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers coming off on the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday issue of NT News, a daily printout of Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be trimmed and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — to be a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only indicates the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and severity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “outside of influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from emergence to continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that “we had never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus.”
“We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO’s January decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak “will, in short, get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering mouth when coughing, keeping distance from people, and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese people, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was started in early January 2020.
The cases were largely related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is believed to have zoonotic origin.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person known to have symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections to the later group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases first reported, new cases had declined in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases from China had increased.
There may be significant under-reporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s top scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection in 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic typically refers to people who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who have died without having taken the test, for example, who have died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know [the official death toll] is underestimated,” a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2020 H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death in January occurred in Wuhan.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths outside China had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given range.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) by April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the fatality coefficient fell from 17.3% (in people with onset of symptoms between 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the lethality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to a disease, and the lethality rate of infection (IFR) who are diagnosed due to a disease.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific infection population through case resolution.
Some scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall lethality rate of infection to the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said, “Without proper control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then go into decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will occur.”
The Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, said it “can end by June” if all countries mobilize to follow the WHO’s recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue in circulation for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible” and “that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year.”
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (catarrhoea), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and blue-colored face or lips. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, septic shock syndrome and acute respiratory distress.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic with no clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, the researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be closely monitored and examined to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between onset of infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, being the close contact considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause the droplets to reach from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets may also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets can land on the mouths and noses of people close to them or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in airborne spread.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread to the stool, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, British authorities advise washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of related coronaviruses in its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity, across the entire genome level, to other coronavirus samples from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
Comparison of the entire genome so far has found, at most, 92% sharing of genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “TC not be used for screening or as a front-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by real-time reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal smear, although throat smear is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had been shown to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral matte glass opacities and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other adenovirus infections, images without confirmation by PCR are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to those of PCR and showed that while the image is less infection-specific, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a tool for research in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed for the detection of features of X-ray and CT images of the virus.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper scarf, and putting this scarf directly into a waste container.
Anyone who has been infected is advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that health professionals who care for individuals who may be infected use the standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
Governments’ use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing their nose and rinsing with mouthwashes, which has already proven ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working on the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO advises to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2–7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in the event of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or day care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of displacement of expiratory droplets when talking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that wearing masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear a face mask when leaving in public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone who enters supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks starting April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use a face mask when going out on the street. At the same time, it was recommended to produce masks at home for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Methods of social distancing can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings and keeping distance from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in one region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a higher risk of serious social illnesses and physical complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic, "replaced" by the WHO and others.
The use of the term "social distancing" led to implications that complete social isolation was needed rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended autoquarenten for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive autoquarenten instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with large-scale transmission were advised to do 14 days of self-quartering since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to slow down the spread and reduce its adverse effects on the health system, as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
Suppression demands more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic at a basic reproduction rate of less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. This is called "epidemic curve flattening".
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of a pharmaceutical nature and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-quarantine; community measures that aim at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events that lead to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to stimulate the acceptance of and participation in China have been more
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, has presented mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government has issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, those who were infected received financial support when they performed the autoquarentine and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, increased production of face masks occurred and those who stockpiled medical supplies were punished. Simulations conducted in the UK and the United States show that reduction (the slowing speed of contagion, without stopping with the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e. the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present great challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, overburdening health systems at the same time.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, the transmission reoccurs as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. There are, however, efforts towards drug development, which include testing existing drugs.
Using cold medications that don’t require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids can make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some “homemade and traditional” medicines can relieve symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs brought about by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control Training, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to shift, at various levels, their resources, including the concentration of available laboratory services in addition to the number of personnel care facilities for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-mandatory procedures and the positive COVID separation and isolation of patients.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case in the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in Hubei province, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, at the Wuhan Provincial Control Center, and the Wuhan Medical Center. On the next day, the Wuhan Provincial Control Center informed the hospital.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, on December 31, issued a statement to the population and informed WHO.
Enough cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub, as well as a major rail connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The reactions of the countries included containment measures such as quarantines in the United States (also known as home confinement orders, home confinement orders or lockdown)3 and curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are confined in some way in the United States, more than 50 million people in South Africa are confined in the Philippines.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case, November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, in samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a coronavirus of the SARS type.
A statement to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed the same day.
When these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed there was no “clear evidence” of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a “people’s war,” to curb the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a sanitary cordon was announced on Jan. 23 to interrupt trips to or from Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 have been canceled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to serve more patients.
Along with newly built hospitals, China has converted 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On January 26, the government launched more measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health statements to travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions on travel were carried out in Hubei and outside it.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
The control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have undergone some kind of restriction of exits. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in this case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. China’s Foreign Minister announced on March 26, 2020, that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details as to when this policy will be terminated.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial stimulus packages to companies. The State Council declared a day of mourning, beginning with a moment of three minutes of silence throughout the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their physical tributes to the on-line COVID, observing
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
It is suspected that Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported having symptoms. South Korea declared high alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of population screening for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who contacted them.
The screening methods included the compulsory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international trips through a mobile application, test of the virus by drive-thru, with results available the next day, in addition to the increase in testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment under the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that from 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should be quarantined for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Feb. 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantined areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on February 28 indicating that the extent of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members testing positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there was a higher risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak began in the country.
At least 12 current or retired politicians and government officials died as a result of the disease by March 17.
As of March 23, Iran has had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there are expected to be five times as many cases in Iran as are being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased on the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In outbreak areas, people are forbidden to enter and leave.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government requested the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, have to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resurrection and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics regarding screening protocols that could be employed.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had had the virus up to that time may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the interruption of all non-essential and social contact trips, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers’ wages up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing accompaniment to the necessary minimum and restricting travel to more than two people.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions have been reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and dispersal of agglomerations.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses considered “essential,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and auto repair shops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control — the U.S. government’s leading public health institute — announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite having done so, the United States had a slow start to testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
Testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (from academies, companies, and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested by the beginning of March (a medical application was subsequently required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

Belgium has collected 100,000 unusable masks, supposedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China’s aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the Chinese authorities’ efforts to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government “provided regular updates to avoid panic near the Lunar New Year festivities.”
On January 23, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the sixth WHO epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On January 30, after confirmation of human transmission in other countries, the pandemic was confirmed in cases outside China and the increase in the number of influenza cases.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked because of the “risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel.”
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparedness in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency of assisting those countries that “do not have systems in place to detect people who contracted the virus, and even if it arises.”
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "to invest now or have to pay later". On February 11, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide the “power of the entire United Nations system as a response.”
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated as a result, enabling the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO states will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic realm and development implications resulting from the outbreak.”

Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready,” insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan further stated that the current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was “deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO faced much criticism for what was seen as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts declared that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group emphasized that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, people with mental problems, the homeless, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, people imprisoned, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo Bolsonaro for managing the pandemic, which began in Hubei province.
Provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary general Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, have rejected an early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” saying that China’s censorship “overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was in turn condemned by some critics as racism and “a way to deflect the administration’s failure to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast managed from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication ploy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as "This has everything to do with China.
It was advised that we try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of a propaganda for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is “a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased viewpoint and ‘politics of generosity’.”
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China has also asked the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And it hears mask-related disputes reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s lack of solidarity with those affected by the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-level political source” that 80 percent of Russia’s supplies were “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
Lombardy region president Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are at a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary.”
NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States’ public sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, high child care, and paid family leave.
Political analysts have anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts, after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be impeached in relation to what they have called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections, and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the government’s management of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply shortages, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-motivated purchases, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier disruptions.
Several locals also experienced the panic-motivated shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has been warning of delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that it would put workers’ health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared from an acute food shortage.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illegal trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortage that has been predicted in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural output did not see a large reduction, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could outpace the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world’s supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have “confused” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on Feb. 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed their most significant declines since 2008, with the Dow falling by 1,191 points, the biggest fall in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All other three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China’s sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop on March 16.
Many consider it a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel restrictions, closures of public places including sights, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry was of an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel station associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year’s festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen by this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Reseller visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Dealers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
The operators of Shopping Centers around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in inland provinces or imprisoned in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32% in 2020, according to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India has left tens of millions of migrant workers in Spain since lost some type of unemployed workers (who are paid through daily wages). A survey of the Angus Reid Institute found that 40,000 of the families in the country have passed through Quad.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Nearly half a million companies in Germany put their workers under government-subsidized short-time work programs known as Kurzabeit.
The German short-time remuneration programme was adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as people – both employed and independent – worldwide.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists when possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have occurred to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attend mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television, while others offer drive-in services.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and the empty St. Peter's Square without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public agglomerations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran’s health ministry announced Friday’s cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as their residents from holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not later than summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and face-to-face poker tournaments have also been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streamed shows or creating online “festivals” for artists to perform, share and disseminate their work.
Online, several memes on the internet about the coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism targeting people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and people from the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving of the virus or being given fair punishment for what they provoked.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is aimed at those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak in new focal countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressing the ban on the entry of Chinese conter into their countries, in the attempt to
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter’s Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has come under fire for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term considered by critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which borders China, and students in India’s major cities have reportedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the unit in the state of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is the reason why God turned against them."
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called him "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign garbage" and targets of "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid access have removed them from some or all coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS virus - CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or who became asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability probably still substantially affects the mortality rates of registered cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal smear is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively, sample material can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or sputum-expelled material (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the “E” gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use from China’s National Medical Products Administration for the SARS-CoV-2 distribution panel based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the first to receive approval for emergency use from the China’s National Medical Products Administration for the distribution panel for the distribution panel for the PCR.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive failure reagent testing, and one impediment to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories authorized to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made tests for COVID-19 nationally available from March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a period of 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (US) for Abbott Labs for a test on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology, rather than PCR.
As it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and particularly binds it to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "chest x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobe opacities in matte glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals started 7 days ago or soon after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. Trials can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
High productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and from now on they are able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an authorisation for emergency use. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were adequate enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspicious patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sampling tube to the patient", they must expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a professional test result shortly after. The British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they go to the hospital.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of a country’s fastest and most comprehensive tests. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 having been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in testing has been offered in several major cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that from the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 10,295 samples were tested by the B-sample in the m-sample in the 12th week of 2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the hospitals Technion and Rambam combined developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously.
With the construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling revealed that the cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had not had online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily yield was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were launched as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, shortages or insufficient amounts of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the UK and the US.
This led some authors to study sample preparation protocols involving heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was disclosed that the United Arab Emirates is now doing more per capita testing in its population for the coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the test level and be on track to achieve higher levels of testing.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capability, and acquisition of a population-scale mass processing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its “Huo-Yan” emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world on this scale to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods for different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany’s method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that have no resource to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was delay in testing made available to the U.S. and to China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of the test kits well at the onset of the outbreak, in addition, these countries near Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing made.
On the other hand, experts say South Korea’s wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private-sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated strengthening testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of cotton swabs and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the particular tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure to collect samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister said he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and would not "use them". The UK acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The testing, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive people had contact, had positive results.
The researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two testing steps of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the displacement to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions for the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales outlets.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened within schedule after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed the most tests, relative to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are better able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only people admitted to hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's butt or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, franc or fish.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be sanitized with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand sanitization:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of washing your hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that best practices for hand washing can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to areas in need.
48% of reductions in diarrhea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
Turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into an entrenched habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin peeling and irritation condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child’s buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of households had the habit of hand washing in countries with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing in developing countries with 97 percent; the United States near the average rate of hand washing in children with 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of hand washing with 23 percent. Various methods for behavioral changes exist at present to increase the acceptance of hand washing in the habit.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
Deworming twice a year, complemented by daily hand washing with soap, daily tooth brushing with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated bar soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic commands for dosing is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no indication that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protecting agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera containing antibacterial diseases, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health's effective saboes are as effective as saboes in antibacterial and antimic acid.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37oC).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous base hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous base hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antiseptic hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a humectant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers that contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisten or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their ends are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The tips of the fingers should also be thoroughly washed and rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause drying of the skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lesser tendency to provoke irritant contact dermatitis has become an attraction when compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has fallen far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, other than alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities can’t afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the earth or ash is contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct handwashing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not seem to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily re-infected. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and shattered enamels can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or care with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for storing water, such as "improvised taps" and other options.
An improvised tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that paper towels are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by paper towels, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying their hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the area of the palm near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying their hands with paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also conducted tests to define if there was potential for cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment within up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms to up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Towel papers did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Washing hands with damp hand sanitizer handkerchiefs is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the intertwining of the fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a newsletter demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and hand friction in the health system sectors.
The organization’s hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this website for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines “Five Moments” for hand washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap ( "medicinal" or "antimicrobial" soaps) confers an exterminating action to a handwashing agent.
Such an exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" the hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with cleaning instruments underhanded, some antiseptics of chlorhexidine or iodine, sterilized towels to dry the hands and is to wash the hands.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not drain to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are washed with a sterilized towel and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after meeting a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the frequency of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Washing with ordinary soap more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced an antibacterial contamination by 26%.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce influenza A, H1N1, and Clostridium difficile spores in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital settings may involve staff awareness of hand washing, increased availability of hand sanitizers to verb and alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most efficient in different health establishments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or handwashing resources in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for achieving the universal practice of handwashing.
For example, in most rural Africa, taps for handwashing near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of rooted habits and not the absence of soap and water.
Encouraging and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and bring about a long-term change in population behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF’s “Three-Star Approach” which encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands in between hygi, sab.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to three maximum stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of promotional handwashing campaigns carried out with the aim of reducing disease and infant mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign trying to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has released the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries compared to the DALY classification.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of the nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health care-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect yourself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "hand-washing techniques" were hung next to hand-washing sinks in public restrooms and in restrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term “washing hands” means declaring a reluctance to take responsibility or to be conniving with something.
It originates from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a more general phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually give more importance to handwashing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning" such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe handwashing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water but not soap, for handwashing is part of a ritual handwashing characteristic in many religions, mainly Bahá'<0xC3><0xAD> faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of the hands in the agibulism, and Christianity.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow hand washing after toilet use.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam authorize handwashing before and after meals.
Workplace Hazard Controls for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies to hazard controls for the prevention of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual worker risk factors, which may be vulnerable to contraction from COVID-19.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), functions with lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a respiratory label, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Functions with average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of being infected by COVID-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or having traveled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and in the large-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with used high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and the provision of personal protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system and morgue workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens from those people.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the job performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have a number of workplace effects.
Workers may be absent from work because they become ill, have to take care of other people, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of acquiring those products (such as making purchases outside of peak hours or for delivery or drive-thru services).
Finally, the sending of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped. An action plan and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and risk factors for individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls needed to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparedness plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people who are most at risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the actions taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, ultimately, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without counting on worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in policy or work procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, properly adjusted as necessary (respirators, for example), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, stored and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, and the use of the respiratory label, including covering sneezing and coughing, preparing other cleaning containers for handkerchiefs and common garbage, preparing for teleworking and staggered work environment, and dismantling tools and shifts.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they have no more fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of these family medications to reduce fever or alleviate other symptoms, and recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain at home, and recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, and allow for a sick leave policy to be flexible.
According to OSHA, work at average risk of exposure includes those who require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people about whom it is not known whether they are confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19 but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission at the company’s location, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with high transmission of COVID-19.
These include protection workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers, protection workers.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from others for a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him or her a face mask, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The crew must wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient presents with fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for biologically hazardous waste, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected then. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other vessels with passengers, hazard controls include delayed travel by the sick passenger, self-isolation, and immediate communication to the onboard medical center if someone shows fever or other symptoms during the journey.
Ideally, medical monitoring should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical education classes or choirs, or meals in a snack bar, increasing the space between tables, tighter arrival and departure times, limitation of non-essential visitors, and use of a separate health care site for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school dispensations may be considered. For law enforcement authorities performing daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medicine technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers should clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow the standard operating procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Functions at high risk of exposure include drug delivery, medical care, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens from these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations or invasive specimen collection.
Work in high-exposure morgues includes workers involved in preparing bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of their death; the risk of exposure makes it very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including when procedures are progenitors of the disease.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some morgue scenarios and in the health area.
Specimens should be handled with biosafety level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspect case for COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 particle filtered facial respirators or superior quality respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend wearing overalls, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct patient care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient’s mask, using only the PPE needed for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing the same ventilator’s diagnostic and coordinating them while treating multiple patients.

We find ourselves in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The companionship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings we have the privilege of working with.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol it is that this essential resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible as you keep workplaces active, pay our co-workers, and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an action appropriate to what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to be away for a while, it’s no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you are able to work at normal hours, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, buy groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedule.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule would not even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No attestation or paid leave is required. Just let your manager know to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification industry so that his industry can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
Employees who work on an hourly basis will receive full payment.
We’ve said that before, and we’re committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and hourly employees.
Everyone will receive their wages based on their normal work schedule under normal circumstances.
Wages are independent if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to let your manager know what to expect and we can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to do.
Site Reliability, HR, Reliability & Security and Fundraising (among others) teams perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of “working folded to recover lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
In order to adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for budgeting, and for employees to prioritize essential work, personal care, and care for loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a shorter journey in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the Annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Office status, exposure and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our co-workers in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance lobby and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own protocol of care duties using products that are safe for its visitors.
We are relieved by the fact that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all Washington employees.
Last week, our office in Washington moved to a totally remote setting, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we’re also arguing about renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider dividing them into several days.
Define the meeting, have a schedule and send materials for reading in advance.
Use videos as standard, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easy to collaborate and connect in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor questions in chat and attendee list, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community aid to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares an end to the pandemic.
We advised you that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete your agreed-upon grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be saddened by the paralysis, but also relieved by the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying up-to-date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with employees.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees who live in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a core workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify it and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, an acknowledgment that at this time our work and obligations will probably need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support it needs, and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and make room for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months, that follow.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that you are in your best condition when you need it.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!

The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the angiotensin-related enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and elevating Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug aimed at treating cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also functions as an entry point in cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter and colectrin domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of the ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to the ECA.
The ECA cleaves the hormone angiotensin type I into angiotensin type II causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates transport by the membrane of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the primary entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the spike protein S1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme in endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host serine-protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing levels of ECA2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitory standard and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia relative to controls."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at elevated risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. rhACE2 infused has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Applications about COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various frameworks for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person with COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be ceded to the government. North Macedonia has launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was at an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand foresee applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if app acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to their App Store, limiting them only to “official” or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should prevent the escalation of discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of systems that preserve privacy have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a unique app, the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message warnings for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to sweeping changes to information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized one.
As of April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracking is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific literature dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile ContactP.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or cross paths to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication “Apps Play Dirty: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a hub that develops privacy technologies and originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and those responsible, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the achievement of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government application, has become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system envisages implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications while preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to address persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system for running system updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repositioning, reperphylaxis, reassignment or therapeutic substitution) is the re-proposal of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than the one for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research targets include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design of antiviral drug development effective against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds that he then perfected and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in his preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine from the state of New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and is authorized through the AUE only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive the treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to stockpile it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to reproduce drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against phylum, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some early pre-trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin’s Alvesco (Cyclesonide), which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The goal is to treat presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients being recruited from among severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
At the moment, researchers from the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
They were not included in the tests for pregnant women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on the use.
A multicenter study with 300 patients is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has been considerable to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as capable of receiving a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19 patients:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical trials completed, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five candidates for the vaccine were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI, stated in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 diverse technology platforms being researched and in development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the larger platforms that have advanced to the Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being designed).
A Phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while at the same time monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (following preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular staple, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary company of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans "in the next 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington at St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and the Army Research Institute Walter Reed at Silver Spring, both in the western Maryland region, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for pre-clinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India’s Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated pace, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in research in the lab, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian stated that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could depart for human testing in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, driving CEPI’s total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing animals for six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the test of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "The MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that elicited potent responses of antibodies specific to antigens [in rats] that were evident to be started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specimens of COVID-19-specific animals, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for Tier 3 biosafety containment measures to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested in non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became predominant, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed phase I of human clinical trials, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectorized vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectorized by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as the SARS Coronavirus.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have already healed. The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced on exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces instead of remaining infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although dissemination may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspicion of the virus and for those responsible for its care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend not to use, some recommend to use and others oblige to use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease was recorded in most countries by all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms, coughing, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease can develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop the symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The role these asymptomatics play in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sperm and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking loudly releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside people's rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore airborne.
Although there is concern that it may be transmitted through the stool, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic. Although there is a possibility of transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually a person infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with recruitment of IL-6 secreting inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in the necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample may be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests using antibodies (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The experience of the Chinese with testing has shown that its accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in bilateral multilobar matte glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the onset of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thickened lobular septa with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, atypical large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands without washing.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering your mouth with the inside of your elbow if the handkerchief is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Strategies of social distancing aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restrict travel and cancel large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include that people be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart from each other.
An effective drug for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to decrease the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve flattening".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptic with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity occurs through ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have gathered treatment recommendations from various agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risks of virus transmission, especially in the health environment, when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation from airborne infections (AISI) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blanket, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to wear respirators rather than facial masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (US).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive airway pressure on two levels.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits aerosol particles from spreading compared to the high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in the elderly (those over 60 years and especially over 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per capita, limiting the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of severe COVID-19 cases enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high PEEP level are required to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High levels of PEEP may not be available on older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are underway with several antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, many of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced phase of testing.
Antiviral medication can be tested in people with various diseases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that volunteers participate in tests for the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has given temporary authorization for the use of plasma from convalescent people as treatment in cases where the person’s life is seriously and immediately threatened.
Clinical studies have not yet been conducted to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to provide their name and ID number.
The app can detect the “near contact” using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people they have had contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people allegedly suffering from coronavirus.
The measure has been taken to bolster quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who is failing to quarantine.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he had been informed by cell phone operators that “40% of people continue to circulate nonetheless.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackaton over the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a mild progression, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness can take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospital admissions with COVID-19, whereas renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early-case study, the median manifestation of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The scan of the lung looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized patients had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The underreporting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to nonsmokers. Concerns were raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority has seen a 20-30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who have recovered from the disease, and lung tests have indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of the onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of symptom onset as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global lethality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2.240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case lethality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying of a disease, and the infection lethality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying of a disease.
These statistics are not time-restricted and track a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed death from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the difference between the sexes are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immune differences due to sex, lower prevalence of female smokers, and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mostly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is from "crown", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in communications to the public.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as the "Coronavirus" and "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended “2019-nCov” and “acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV” as interim names for the virus and the disease, according to the 2015 guidance against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal spiders and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the required schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread across the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is underway in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY Trial” to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with the most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to elicit a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spine protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of either of these strategies should have the safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a possible challenge to the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been more than 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report in late April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of COVID-19 drug and vaccine candidates was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir by compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for parity review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorization for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after having demonstrated low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spine protein in preparation by serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokine. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the conclusion of a small study.
A non-randomised phase 2 national level trial is underway in Italy, having demonstrated positive results in people with the serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-induced cytokine-release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people in need of them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
