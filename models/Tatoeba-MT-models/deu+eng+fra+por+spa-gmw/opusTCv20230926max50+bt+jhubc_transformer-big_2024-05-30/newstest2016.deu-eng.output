Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been eager for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-advertised deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of the Republicans, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before Congress, which was partly regarded as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly shrill voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block: “I’m so sorry, I wanted I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me,” according to the authorities in the letter, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office, according to police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police imprisoned him.
A day after the university shooting, students and faculty forced to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he was dealing with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the doctorate that Lamb had worked so hard for would not guarantee him an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr. Lamb’s imagination.”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from campus, police later found Lamb's trail as he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a home about a mile south of his parental home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the women’s swarm at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there was no record of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that adjoined a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’s ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had stayed friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was totally devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of Sept. 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelight memorial service.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call did call Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the employees and seasonal workers currently employed with it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, while 45,000 workers were hired in the Christmas season of 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start interviewing this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, “Back in Time.”
The movie begins, and it comes to mind that I’m a simulated yawning and an arm’s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back for the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “controversially the biggest time travel movie ever shot.”
“Back in Time” will be on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-old conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council – the US, Russia, China, Britain and France – on the sidelines of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers “make this situation insoluble.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in tackling the crisis in Syria.
8 Poll Values That Show Donald Trump Is To Be Taken Seriously
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some are beginning to seriously question what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s resilience and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate mogul isn’t just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers hold in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as their candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).
The next one in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angry” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish Republican-minded voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first pre-electoral state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively carry out his office, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
If they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the final cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to just 28% for finalist Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters see Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters backing Trump say they have firmly forgiven their votes.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change their minds.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in the 2016 public discourse.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will do as well.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post’s new Monday poll that they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “hellishly upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea watt.
In the street, a square meter of a paddock house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"In Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited," the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student office in Munich is not really a little.
In contrast to Germany’s top residential locations, however, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, note.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is exceptionally not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goaltender in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A happy goal by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witchcraft boiler of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's score (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to take the Henkelpott to Munich in the third start.
On his 28th goal in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership, Müller was kindly assisted by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who let a shot of the world champion pass as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed imagination without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home matches in the royal class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
But the Bayern, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They went bravely, but in their offensive efforts often too unimaginative to work.
The attacks were too often initiated by relocating the game to the left-hand side Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flank struck from the right half-field in the upper left Toreck.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best chances in half one.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct acceptance, the goalkeeper Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needlesticks.
But on goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was relied.
So, for example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the lattice (56.).
Before New, Guardiola had a four-piece chain defended with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, was initially sitting outside.
The World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training, sports director Matthias Sammer told "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, this is already malicious".
Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the battered Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller put another on it on the penalty.
Before the game, there were riots in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mummified Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich supporters with batons.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and transported from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth.
Smoking damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk will go down quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of losing their teeth prematurely.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is unclear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the danger to drop back to the level of non-smokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE explained: "Smoking shortens lifespan."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by dental insanity, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remnants from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rhine boulevard, archaeologists at the Roman Germanic Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil memorials.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always used as a specialist office for the maintenance of archaeological soil monuments.
In the third stage of construction of the Rhine boulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It had already been known from text documents that a fortress stood on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 tombs was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman crashed at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
On early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 am the woman crossed the tracks coming from the direction of the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train that came from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she suffered the most serious injuries according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on the spot by ambulances and taken to a hospital.
The investigating officials have no information on the reason for the young woman's overnight crossing of tracks.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or local residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information on the cause of the accident can be given by calling the Federal Police Hotline at 0800/6888000 or any other police department, which is available 24 hours a day.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To ease the dispute over the proposed transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its operation corresponds significantly to more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion of recent months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The Investor-State Arbitration Procedures (ISDS) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitral tribunals are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel judiciary through which companies can sue for damages at the expense of taxpayers, overturn national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as insufficient.
It was criticised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform that Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel and other EU trade ministers worked out in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the possibilities of action of the economy by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized companies could be at a disadvantage, it said.
The talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been underway since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sat on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart, on which the shy-looking folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken over by Steven’s lecture.
He tells from various places, which he repeatedly inscribes on the map, what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs tell us about.
Where they were born and what it looks like there, in their homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that harmoniously snuggle very close to the American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive expectations.
Reduced, Stevens appears here.
Live is enough guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
In 2005, "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") was released as a widely acclaimed masterpiece.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is on the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any of the yearly charts of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic offset pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth neat studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long time out of the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark kept Hamburger More!
He is currently presenting Carrie & Lowell, which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and folklore.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians performs through the broadly enriched album.
From the audience one hears: the lecture is "more opulent" and one can thus "throw away the plate basically".
Only to an addition, Stevens thanks himself modestly, plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bows under squealing applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut has been eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister’s question time.
The new Labour chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut at the prime minister’s questioning session and will be confronted for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being reviewed by the media and the Labour MPs closely.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn’s leadership, as he comes to the shadow cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several front page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stand in respectful silence" and had acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also “stacked” within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn’s remarks on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is introducing changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later Mr. Smith, the shadow labor and pension minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against government plans to lower the cap from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman to whom David Cameron, since being Tory’s head, has been standing across the dispatch box in parliament for the past decade.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s questioning hour is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “strike dexterity” and quarrelling with barbs, and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought into discussion the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theatre", often linked to the Prime Minister's questioning hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the questioning hour with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader's verdict and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': Homeless young people trained to become photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply following data showing an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most accurate estimate of the timing of an interest rate increase since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20% jump after a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed sales in China – a key market for Burberry – reported growth again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it took $2.5 billion from a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs set its rating rating to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On the Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappish 21 years young, a pennant with a sleek frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair weighs 100 million euros.
Rather, more so.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is turning around.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton" before.
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 o’clock in the morning, however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: This is where your idol lives, whose posters hang in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much per day as her mom Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "My Wiktoria actually would have to be in the tenth grade of high school."
“I’ll fulfill a dream for her.”
Compulsory schooling?
Who's juckt's?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising in the Superbowl's advertising break, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company rinsed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and walks over the table, Bieber also collects.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you are amazed at the window.
He is said to have plundered more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally at number 1 in the US and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Field Idea
Potatoes or Döner?
Both are possible - and that is in the potato fielder, which the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a skewer.
The idea came up with a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Cartoffeln statt Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a grill skewer, stuffed with meat and potatoes, has been spinning in his shop.
“This is multiculti for the stomach,” Alhay says.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the skewer contains.
Just so much: “It tastes even better together,” he finds.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches ground-level campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a down-to-earth campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA Supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like ice cream maker Simmo from Dunsborough distributing samples at IGA stores and store owners selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on Sept. 29 as the food, alcohol and appliance wholesaler conducts its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will snatch away around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve revenues of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s revenue in the food and grocery business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and grocery trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while putting pressure on revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting back and investing more than $150 million to align selling prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores through fast-growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash’s chief executive, Ian Morrice, says price adjustments and store refurbishment programs will increase, hoping that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the “collateral damage” in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior, according to Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as the "Special Ks", came into the spotlight through Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racket after a spasm defeated a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
“One thing I’m getting pretty excited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi got pulled into the fight a little bit,” Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost to a bump in the U.S. Open, but he’s not the first player to break a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well at the US Open, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He’s got a great team around him, he’s got a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing room, he trains hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man of returning to the team as a long-term permanent component."
“First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick made the ascent very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time out of the spotlight, I think it is best for him to think about it, and it is only in the light of what he is doing.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency, locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those trying to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed on the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man country and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustration increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted “Open the border!” and shouted insults against the Hungarian police on standby.
Some rejected food and water out of protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more migrants arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There will have to be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually – next month or by the end of the year – an agreement would be reached that EU countries would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are in search of a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime, and also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
“Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to agree to the military’s expected deployment next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers carrying vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, state security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a barbed wire train arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would deny food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is certain which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but those advances have diminished.
Their support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has vanished, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
Clinton still has a strong lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was two-way ahead of Sanders in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
About half of Democratic voters in the country’s pre-elections say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic pre-election voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked on an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
Consent to dealing with the problems and selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidency into the balance, 57 percent of Democratic pre-election voters want to see him in the race — even though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters in the pre-election are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped by 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the “most selectable” has risen.
Nevertheless, when asking what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these voters in the primaries.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well on some important characteristics of voters in their party's primary.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden scores best in honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the pre-elections generally also view Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters in the pre-elections are satisfied with her statement of the matter and say it has not influenced their views overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their overall views of Clinton, though 36 percent said their views of her had worsened.
It’s mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters altogether: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush score best in honesty.
A majority consider Sanders to be honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson gets close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others dramatically lose hold
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, up 23% in the most recent CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, up 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is well received by demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson is on the rise in polls — he lands at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side-slashes for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for swimmers to find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees should be a rather short pleasure.
Many people no longer go into the sea: a maximum of 18 degrees Celsius is in the North and Baltic Seas this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood members burdened with death of Baruch College novice
Nearly two years after a student died during a harassing ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to approach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng fainted and were reportedly waiting an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the Brotherhood fundamentally above that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with blunt force to the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood’s harassment; at least one student has died of harassment every year since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and forming a criminal association.
"We not only want to hold the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the uptick will be shaken, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
As a result, Central Bank representatives have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement about an interest rate increase may have been exaggerated.
“The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some sectors of the economy might respond based on historical trends:
As the market has seen last month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a trend that income will be stifled 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy,” German bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike, quite flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return on the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment manager at Nu Doll's Investments.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the rise cycle and the return begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is noteworthy that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point if the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal GDP of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question “whether this time is different,” Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a year-round Fed interest rate hike, and all eyes have been on this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all the increase cycles from 1950 to the present took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and overshadowed pre-recession levels very quickly after recovery began,” the report said.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
With bonds, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields drop immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to shrink closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-income bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, although “we are still cautious about expecting higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says, markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit margins have widened and volatility has risen – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
Overall, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with high debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to respond overwhelmingly positively three months after an initial interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low stock volatility also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher earnings, even if experts disagree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of parliament criticized the station for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" into Classic FM, a leading member of parliament claims, raising new pressure on the station to prove it is doing something that private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station is “dumb” and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like using the word ‘stupid’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something else — these are two spontaneous examples where you’re actually just mimicking what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
BBC Director General dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music making that’s truly unmatched.
“And Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new works is also really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that work needs to be done harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for kicking the commercial rival on its feet.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in a special BBC way".
He added that he wants the company to “find a hit from our in-house stable” when it launches an entertainment series the next time.
However, he refused to opt out of ordering further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend the fee payers’ money on other entertainment formats.
Internet revenues rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago with the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now that’s commencing, and we may see growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe buyers are holding back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers struggled over bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried dead in crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia Partially Charges the Collapse of the Huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed at Mecca’s Grand Mosque.
The mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the stretch to pay their respect when the first of the dead made their final journey to the Al-Moassem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Site, where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crash of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of cranes, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for not taking up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking on larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crane crash came amid strong winds and rain, just days before millions arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured people receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says the time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons are laying down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen performing the work in their home.
If you can skilfully handle painting walls with a hammer or brush, you seem to be a minority nowadays.
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to do home improvement jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the DIY chain, said a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices is now outdated.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, because eight out of ten buying decisions at the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are predominant among the employees.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: “There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions made about buying items by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a leading UK company listed on the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group blamed the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
At the state court in Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants used funds from club accounts, through which they were allowed to dispose in their functions, for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was dismissed by the President of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
On the rejection of the infidelity, the defense showed that the association did not at any time have an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials would have only paid compensation for expenses and removed the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, from the debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 Schilling (approximately 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: are we going to continue running the club or are we going to lock up?" said one of the defendants, a large-scale auditor of the tax office.
Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
“We’ve thrown money forward, put our life insurance as collateral at the bank,” he said.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
In addition, if financial success is achieved, the payment of the compensation has been decided retrospectively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the compensation was not paid until years later, that is, from 2003, when a plus had been in the account.
Therefore, flat-rate and not detailed debits appeared, the former officer explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been disclosed to the club in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial situation, the only important thing was the debt freedom, according to the answer.
In 2011, when an official began to be investigated for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
This was the case, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The interviewee did not know an answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he thought this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about that money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The co-defendant was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer has been formulated as a "compensation for damages".
Why do you want to pay the damages?, the judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this wording because the club had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor."
“Am I a lawyer?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said that he had never received a cent salary, he only paid mileage and diets.
He charged the club 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
These were no longer stored after an operational audit in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant was also charged with mileage.
All corrections were made in cash, for this he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the Bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The trial will continue on September 23 with the interrogation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year staff cut, the computer giant will cut further jobs in the process of splitting up the company.
The job cuts at US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) have come to an end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion) in costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs in the last three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still had approximately 302,000 employees.
After the stock market, the Hewlett-Packard share fell 2.3 percent.
The Palo Alto-based group, which has grown up with printers, is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business is to be bundled into a new company this year – separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data stores for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business will be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services recently led to the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
Revenue decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job cuts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, reacted lately to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more stores online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans foresee the total dismantling of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly be rejected: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
Twenty-four percent are against interfering in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is opposed by 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent in favour.
29% were unable to decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Connecting Mobility" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: An outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police on the Serbian border at Röszke used tear gas and water launchers against several hundred angry refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had formed behind it and a water canister was ready behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
Officials initially used pepper spray uninterruptedly.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This disbanded the group.
The refugees have now retreated a little while.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees sacked in themselves and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokespersons also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide on interest rates for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is watching the U.S. Federal Reserve meet on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half who were still thinking last week that the Fed would do so now thinks the Fed will hold on for a little longer and keep interest rates at the current 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero range and starting a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior executive at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small amount of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
Death Sniper at Delta State University Leaves Apology Letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before shooting and killing his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was “sorry” about the first murder and wanted to “make it unhappy,” authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number at around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency room worker that police had to send police to his home.
He said, “I shot my wife last night” and he also mentioned that there is a “sweet dog” in the house but that “no one will disturb” but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
As police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “of course there was something in Mr. Lamb’s imagination.”
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them “he’s not going to jail.”
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as indicated by his life style on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this certainly takes its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the company.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the Group’s jobs.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is renovating its corporate structure and is upgrading its Eurowings airline.
The aim of the reorientation is a contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a board of directors for passenger business at Lufthansa in the future.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the management team led by Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the future.
With the new line-up, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of annual revenues of 30 billion euros.
New Negotiations with Pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilots' association cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the judicially stopped strike on Thursday.
This was announced by the union.
The topic of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
The cockpit aims to achieve “sustainable results in a year with a predicted record result” as soon as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, the savings concept "Wings" is the background.
In the fight against competitors, Lufthansa will outsource routes to the group’s own low-cost airline Eurowings.
Under the title "Morgenzug in den Süden" can be seen paintings by Leena Krüger in the Künstlerhaus.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Manchester Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left winger cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be relocated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the locker room he had an oxygen mask on.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very serious injury.”
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the court, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing himself very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how hard something like that can be.
I feel very bad about it. I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues, “funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I love to read to my kids because it always seems to give a picture or message we’ve missed so far.”
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a statement of content from the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"Amidst the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one. However, a love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seus's unstarel.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough yet: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins as follows: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears as the local environment through the greedy, tree-falling, Thneed knitting once-ler despite the protests of the naming Lorax, a squatting, snor-beared being, "speaks in the name of the trees. "
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s staff, but gave no further direct comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with expulsion from England's team, but it's still hard
Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad England selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t carry scars from 2012, just a teen-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared towards results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because – and I said this earlier – players are their own best pickers.
Long ago, Lyth's career would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he makes more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had the chance to play home and away.
The only accusation that can be made was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but this lost chance now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I highly value.
He’s an X-Factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us a lot.
He must get at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the squad in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a striker can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me very much as a young man.
People might look at his stats — on average 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a point, but there’s not a large number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as an advisor for the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what has been said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not on the one-days, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Some won’t agree, but coaches and team builders don’t set the schedule.
And you have to keep in mind that like with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit stockpile (Brexit = exit of the UK from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy goes into a slump by 2017
David Cameron’s unbridled re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to become the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely fighting over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always out of their own fault, are fed up with Britain’s own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it when it threatens social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greats, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Germany’s cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the exaggerated long-standing perseverances such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks forward to his re-election or replacement in 2017.
It is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to tear out a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK — something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bankruptcy" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You may remember weakly Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as a “EU Straight Banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
These included the medley of tax-fearing rogues, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-nationals who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him, rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum swirl, because Blair had set the principle of the unenacted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he didn't need any more time for me to waste -- seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott of Murdoch's strategy of the '80s, a mistake then and today.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I kindly express it - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue-colored trend and the wilder terrain of Tory’s petty Englishism can probably say yes to it.
It’s what Hilary “A Benn but Not a Bennite” Benn said on radio and television this week when the Scout struggled in him not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father on television tried to be disloyal to his fellow Labour cabinet members without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “under all circumstances” — Benn’s expression — wasn’t what McDonnell said, nor was it what JC told his fellow fighters and MPs after all reports at their Monday night exam session.
Whatever Corbyn’s touchy bottom-up image wants to convey – remember that it even touched me – news discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and above all in the whirlpool of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right to not give Cameron a free ticket for Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the Tory government’s cost cuts in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “basic report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
But some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims are “based on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing directors are said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said they would receive funds from an e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state an industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco management.
The group’s research “significantly admits that there is a lack of “hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE’s claims that “there is so far no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had been responded to beforehand.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die annually from an illness related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC to give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would “give their right arm” for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard-fought time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully for six years in his time on Channel 4 to get in touch with the BBC.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programs that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programs that others don't make or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s nonsense, of course.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program finances that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I’m trying to see how this is going to be public television.
I don’t think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews “because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support.”
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows reflect what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more public niche programs should “go to BBC4, where you can’t quite measure the audience, but they perform their duties, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion broadcasting fees, “Well, of course, we’ve created all these obscure programs that no one has seen.”
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcast fee, Johnson told the committee, “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of terms of who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a big value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s right, because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to “inform, train and entertain”.
He said little of the BBC's production would now officially be classified as education -- he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio -- and it should take an example on the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this by "informing, educating and entertaining".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Proms, of which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial channels to make everything available online.
‘Sonogenetics’ Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The pulses work by turning on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the micro bubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to ultrasound signaling in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertisements Shame on UK Arms Trade
Watch Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Trade Fair Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle crushing legs!
Streubombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s readiness to deliver weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on subway trains that require a second look.
"Important Announcement: Do you travel with the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute it in London and used “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of inbus keys claimed to “get access to around a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet.”
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements, noticing that they have to go outside into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon-trafficking posters greets commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the weapons fair – through an empty part of the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertising, but "by blowing in with bright colors and animation it remains more adherent."
“They’ve done a fantastic job of helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a British government intervention and a guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a U.S. Army order for "the AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped battlehead that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target."

Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a dormitory, still believing in Beret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed—and the numerous, long-breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to gossip: people tell you where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and communal meeting places, but they’re also the places where people dress up and pull their underwear.
Related: Don’t Think About Starting a Relationship at University
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student dormitories form a room-to-room buzzing culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I’ve spent interacting with you.”
Try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from sociability — and text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Do it.
A guy in my dormitories had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
As you begin college at the height of the back mania, knocking on people’s doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s greeting “Welcome to the neighborhood, I’ve baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.”
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to chat and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, the clawing of chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
Chances are they say they serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my roommate, who added a dishwashing agent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
They should not make noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the proverb, one of the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they care about putting drum and bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before she let her own music blew, closed her door, and went on to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be profoundly embarrassing to think of a roommate as your future spouse, get close to her, break up and then see her every day, and maybe watch her move all the mutual friends over to you?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your abdomen a little reason.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unclosed room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it only takes moments before it becomes a boomerang.
By hiding, teach a valuable and amusing lesson about safety – but never spoil anyone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not tack their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Semi-detached houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses in the central Frankish Eckental for people who don’t have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income earner."
“I’m showing you how you can still build cheaply and well today,” says the 44-year-old in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: he builds row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In the face of the refugee flow, we still need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very trivial, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I have carried out my project correctly.
The imminent Damoclesschwert Sonderbau and the Stellplatzverordnung always make it particularly complicated.
Scary.
It is still assumed that if you create three apartments in a terraced house, you need at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is there a lack of space.
Refugees and asylum seekers don’t have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don’t you exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It’s true: We’ve had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low-income person.
I show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to Get the New iPhone Operating System When Apple Update Is Released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message saying that "Software Update Failed".
To get around the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will take you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make space – but Apple has made it more unlikely by slimming down the update, and it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a termination of the update.

Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The World Cup runner-up stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the runner-up ahead of the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also taking on the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brit won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a haze bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who visited Bad Kissingen more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st Class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to accommodate chess players who cannot raise the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Neighborhood office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined forces under the cloak of the Social Foundation and have opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city center.
More specifically, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and counsellors will now receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or benefits from health and nursing insurance companies.
For years, we have been finding out with our outpatient care service that caregiving relatives are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Many services are often not used by the cash registers, because the complexity of the insurances is hardly understood," explained the new landlady Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Citizens' Hospital as well as the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapy treatment.
The offers of the Senior Center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Seniors' Center for Care and Care," explained Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is the demographic change in particular.
This makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to loneliness in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In doing so, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The Neighborhood Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs. Würzburg Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third leaguer Würzburg Kickers had not yet been fixed, now the 6th of October has been fixed as the date.
The meeting of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third league player FC Würzburger Kickers has now been definitively concluded.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 pm in the Bamberg Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy that we now know when the game is going on stage, now we have certainty of planning," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now-launched pre-sale of tickets.
“It’s special for our team to play against a third league player.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg entered the 2010 round with victories at 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Title defender is third-league descender SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the deans of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after World War II at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but also as a teacher, writer and director of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983, he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in Vienna’s Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese throws police officer with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
Once a footballer, Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and committed to Bremen and Hoffenheim, is now a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not increased.
Meadow was just getting his hair cut in Bremen city centre when he saw a parking lot guard putting out a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Grass then stormed out of the shop, insulted the officer and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination," the city of Bremen said.
Only then will it be decided whether the meadow is displayed or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.
For the past three days, the Panamanian authorities have been ripping off the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 pm, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and urged them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft petrol station.
There were also three people on the site of the gas station.
One of these men shouted at the young man and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a rupture of the nose and bleeded heavily from the nose.
When his two friends hurried and appeased the baton, it initially departed from his sacrifice.
The injured young man was now taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket is said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in jeans and a brown-and-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and whistleblowers to call at 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests €310000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Bernd Bormann, Mayor of the Samtgemeinde, Uta Seim-Schwartz, and Heinfried Kabbert, Mayor of Asendorf, are also pleased about this.
In many places in the country, doctors are lacking - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will continue to support his successor in the coming months with half a place.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopened the practice on 12 October, until then he invested €310,000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and also wants to enter the practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it was time, I just called her.”
Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,” says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to get to know and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees it as an advantage to soon be his own boss.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller, a two-time family father, grew up there, and his medical studies in Hanover followed internships in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, he was also appointed as a senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and volunteers in the DRK preparedness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as house doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of a total of 50000 euros as part of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," emphasises Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, around 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, while the average practice in northern Germany is about 500.
In Asendorf there is another family doctor's office.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller’s takeover of the practice: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who visit Müller’s office continue to look primarily in familiar faces: the seven medical specialists and the cleaning staff take over from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen, smiling.
A little sadness will be felt after a long time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and many patients will surely still see many times," says the internist.
Her husband adds, laughing, "We have a 6,000-square-meter plot."
“So far I’ve always been pushing for gardening, now it could be different.”
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"The border controls are now also being lifted at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain in place in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The provision and safety of people is paramount.
But it is also clear that “there needs to be clear signals,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
We need a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel further towards Austria and Germany and possibly also build corridors for the refugees.
But that was not what Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar saw in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will intensify border surveillance - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to erase its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work,” Znidar said.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to enter eastern Croatia at the border crossing between Tovarnik and the South to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to catch them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees are constantly arriving in the Croatian city of Tovarnik.
These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in operation.
In the coming days, his country is expecting about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be rerouted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was instructing people to take certain routes: “We cannot, nor do we want to do this,” it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early morning, and more buses were expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometres away.
“We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
Thus, the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, already predicted by observers, to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"
Croatian Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a heavy influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently provided good evidence of the country’s standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down early Wednesday at a local eye ticket in Horgos: he considers the debates on alternative routes for refugees premature, after the Hungarian border is now closed.
At the moment, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It is not yet clear whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless: in parts of the border area there are still unclear minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hacker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information captured is said to have been insider trading in the financial markets.
In this way, according to the investigators, a total of more than 100 million dollars was raised.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around Mannheim Paradeplatz there is lively operation.
People do their errands, sometimes fast-paced, sometimes leisurely strolling.
You will drive to the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at the Paradeplatz.
Keep the city railways.
Pulsating, bustling life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tables each with the headline "Before I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid has drawn attention with this action to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of Ecumenical Hospice Aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously pick up the chalk and add to the phrase "yes to my life", "can read", "drive through the US with the camper", "stop the war" or "not suffer for long", others stop short, read, say phrases such as "I am not yet so far" and then go on.
Again and again small discussions develop on the fringe about the action itself, about life, the handling of dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come to me at some point can I live responsibly," says the director of the Diaconal Work of Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the sponsor of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this publicly effective action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The topic of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening up of people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid sought out volunteers, it had immediately contacted and had been involved in the founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected person and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the St. Vincent hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
“I see life from another wait, I think it’s precious and I appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of denomination.
The financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There too, other personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx Results Mixed, Financial Outlook for 2016 Lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its full-year earnings outlook due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it made a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, which average 4.9 percent and will take effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large parcels, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase year-on-year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “provides solid returns by considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused sales in its unit to stagnate express shipping.
But the boom in online shopping has increased results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger parcels and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it’s time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening above them is a mural of the United States at one end of the ornate, two-storey meeting room.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned by the unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by raising interest rates on federal bonds – even if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the job market and inflation will be the most important thing they are seeing,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is inconsistent with the financial market.
About half of economists polled recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far from it.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the rates at that time,” he said.
If it does, “it should go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets so they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world tumbled at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% below its peak in May when investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy would stifle global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be taking the reins in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better control the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “tighten” its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is advocating for an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia prompted the Fed to lower its interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings “despite limited noticeable effects on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
Recent turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of a rate hike because markets are getting upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and doesn’t mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should move ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the checkouts and has various take-away options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork bowel, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Straße.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a real school.
Brazil’s Rio Grande Pediatric Society Promotes Nutrition for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar installation.
The plans for the long-awaited gym building at the Bernried sports grounds are progressing step by step: At the recent municipal council meeting, the drafted building proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had decided among other things on a request for a building law "exemption" or "exemption" from the valid development plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form of roof construction.
Accordingly, a "sattel roof with non-middle first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This brings us together a wonderfully large south roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the roof inclination, which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - contrary to what is prescribed in the building plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was necessary because the building plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roof slope - whereby the Bernrieder Gemeinderat usually proceeds rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, the construction of gyms is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent", says Steigenberger.
The building of the gym at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from school and broad sports funding.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau with them.
This is envisaged by the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by the county councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, September 23.
Should the plans be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with Fischer and the existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
Employees who cannot come to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should take over, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrading" and a widening of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
As a transition for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to run both houses, until next year the former hospital of the shortage, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the hospital Weilheim is complete.
Councilwoman Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, has been opposed by rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Knappschaft, is to be used as accommodation for asylum weavers in the future.
As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatric clinic.
"What could not have happened to us, such an opportunity does not come again," said Fischer about the quasi-movement to Lech, which had been received by the employees "positive and very understanding".
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by colleagues from Schongau to take over the position of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg hospital (once 100 beds) was repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades, departments were closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (20.15 am) at the Bergischen HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvest on a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were in action, police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident happened was not clear at first.
The criminal police investigated.
Missing 16-Year-Old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violent Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of the missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the youths and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old woman from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, according to prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who according to the crime confessed and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning, after she had not come home the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
When searching for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal belongings of the victim.
Interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing finally revealed a suspicion against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee admitted to police during the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the judge on Wednesday, the investigators put him to death.
Further investigations are expected to reveal the circumstances of the incident.
Refugees need housing: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing towards a market that is already overcrowded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the "Social Housing Alliance".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then bump into the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also shows significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing ahead with a housing deficit that grows year after year.
Currently, some 770,000 housing units are already missing in the metropolitan areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professional workers therefore lived in large cities, forced to stay in flat-bedrooms.
Young adults stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slump on the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are to boost social housing.
Thus, the property tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a limited period.
In addition, according to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The funding programme for refugee shelters of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with 184 million euros, more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been retrieved on Monday evening.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
There is virtually no way through to Hungary, as more and more refugees choose their way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian interior minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian interior minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: “You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity.”
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it is people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia with the EU-neighbour Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they had tried to reach Croatia on foot over the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
But the border strip poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearers should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, hardly any more refugees arrive in Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people.
Shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
In the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated.
Those convicted face imprisonment of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
However, practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In the Hungarian view, Serbia is a "safe third country".
Rejected asylum seekers should be deported there.
In front of the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the side of the road in recent weeks.
Blocking grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria reaches only a few refugees.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
Around 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Trains from there to Germany were stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
The mayor drove the “stranded” across the border.
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffed the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the near Passau.
Previously, we first served the unexpected guests, with snacks and drinks.
We said right away, we'll take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the OÖN talk.
You were very grateful.
One man did not hesitate to donate a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
“We were very pleased,” said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany was stopped, but still across the border.
The regional train was stopped in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border travel is generally high in price.
The Brückenfest was a sociable event with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately assisting in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp, our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the fog of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the “promised country” that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in the face of the ongoing refugee flows and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for protection seekers.
And there will be an even bigger one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has all his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having weight in his word.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the first reception center in Traiskirchen has already come under control of Konrad.
“We don’t have homeless people in Traiskirchen anymore,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also without much turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organisational "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects to have a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more housing will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a barrel without soil,” Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the state leaders.
They promised him that they would also provide quarters for the coming refugees.
“In Upper Austria things are going well,” said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts high expectations in the ORF action "Helps like us".
On the platform, private individuals can easily offer accommodation.
In addition, you are hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it could not be that accommodation providers have to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or size of the skylights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" would have to apply.
That he, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, is more successful in housing, Konrad justifies with his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told the falsehood.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not charge the Republic any cost, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
So far, the search for our own quarters has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips-Arena and the Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, since the affected people could be accommodated at the moment without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in case of an emergency, further locations should be checked for their suitability.
The city chief is critical of the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute.
Seehofer: "Borders are not locked"
In a lengthy phone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed to further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
Refugees can continue to travel to the Federal Republic of Germany.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" of the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general refurbishment of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz Industrial Line is officially completed.
The publicly traded IT group S&T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, with the rest (2,700 square meters) to be rented out to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
“In IT, smart minds are our raw material – and we have to try to get them to work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring some.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros by the Techcenter, which is each owned by one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30% of the remaining 2,700 square meters of space in the building are already rented, for another 40% there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project shortly in the pigeon market arcade: finally, she has now received growth in the form of another business location.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where it sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything is now about women’s handbags of the Furla brand, purses are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, it was rebuilt for several weeks.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another store," Breit says.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also fascinated by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the greater Linz area to sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been cradled by her mother Breit.
I am most suited when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get enchanted when they see a beautiful handbag, the expert woman can not answer with the utmost certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag adds value to every outfit.
The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This attribute also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for thrillers.
Whether he is xenophobic, is rude to journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is stirring up the election campaign vigorously.
And do it well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate town of Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire came from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a term for many in the wine-growing village on the wine route.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant town is more than -- ten corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed with their Kallstadt style," says Simone Wendel.
The Kallstadt native has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, including Trump and the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, not known for his modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - with the statement that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, it also tends to be the opinion that Trump “is already a bit of a big mouth,” says Wendel.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity was "Die Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the facilitators, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the invaders.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold digger's shop in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not without tragedy: their desire to return home in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he had once fled without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal emigrant.”
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken derogatoryly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Like the poltering, it’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "he's always so blistering".
Do you think Trump is coming?
“I can’t imagine that,” said the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt."
Pension landlady Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
“I can’t imagine Donald doing that,” the 68-year-old says.
She would be better off if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had the say at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, “he would never have arrived there.”
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winegrower daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also arousing in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climbing village".
From the hand of the vice-president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism.
In Austria there are already 20 "mountain climbing villages".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are rushing to Canberra to report on the loss of Liberal leadership, but it hasn’t yielded any major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Army Days, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This drawback of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase from ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today averaged 318,000 in August compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's The X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two from The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, yielded an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and in the second half-hour a whopping 720,000.
Hot-seat averages 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia’s second-night odds will be confident that Hot-Seat will eventually win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for the million-dollar minute that failed to outperform the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
A secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was covered in the utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three become two, you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's final
All three women have lyrically ignored why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?", her answers could become the game-breaker who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay, apart from herself, as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed [Sarah’s] and Sam’s energies, I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show,” Jeavons said.
“Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be “the One.”
“As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that obviously this isn’t just a game – I’m now unreservedly set on him,” she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 pm, on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. – and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne picked the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a scramble as the Aussie Rugby League convert did in his first point return on Tuesday in the 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also into the ongoing game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by specialty team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about his dilapidated catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne grazes at a point that was restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carver with his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling stock with guns.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts stopped.
The Free Voters are calling for the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW fall clause in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis at Bavaria's schools, if there are not accordingly new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will have a setback in the Bavarian education system."
The parliamentary group of free voters will meet until Friday in the Lower Franconian commune.
In fact, quite different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will override the exam," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
“This is not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes,” said the Free Voter leader.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the free voters as soon as possible.
Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states throughout the country."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
“We need to be more capable of action.”
But state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing torch remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "Mid-Level Plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the middle school from three to four years is tested - in the result it then takes again nine years until the Abitur.
But Aiwanger doesn’t go far enough.
“The G9 issue needs to be accelerated,” said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever you want.
Wall Street is helping Dax jump.
The German stock market has closed with profits after a directionless and nervous trading course over long distances.

Many stock exchanges expect that the markets will take place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also after the great decline on the futures exchanges on this Friday.
The discussion about the burdens of the nuclear phase-out has in the meantime pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and also left deep marks at Eon.
According to "Spiegel", the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions.
The German government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a trader, a positive report by US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend followed.
Investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip manufacturer.
The investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were again sold than in the same period of the previous year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The shares of car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent, respectively.

The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, known to be capable of killing but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would diminish their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step toward a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The plot at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of commerce, commerce and housing is planned - but concrete offers do not yet exist.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of land of about 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
The site is planned to be used for a mix of trade, commerce and housing.
They are waiting for offers, according to the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building demolished on it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home at the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Many residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational refuge
For months it had been negotiated behind closed doors, pondered, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home at the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans to the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee for the first time on Monday evening.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP group, who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the system construction management into the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which costs around 10 to 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among seaside stall owners who had come into the session sparked the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of sea stalls and board member at the advocacy of the neighbors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that surpasses all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must come whole bus loads in order for this to be calculated", says Schulz.
However, what exactly is happening on the one-hectare area of the former restaurant is still unclear.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a conclusive concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Twin offspring with gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to have some offspring with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years old and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet known, as Mother Dian has kept them tightly on the body so far.
First, the “picture” reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system, about in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Double Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced a doubling-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family desperately seek help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria that displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to take in food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tube formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained about the same in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely and 28% partially resolved diabetes.
In the medically-treated group, in comparison, diabetes completely resolved only at one percent and in some cases only at about two percent.
In addition, the results in the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “generally were better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” — as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and more likely to have completely overcome diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival among surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“That’s the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” she said, without an increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with their BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, reversal is really hard.”
Love story takes place in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently getting more and more attention in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unappealing at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and the latter falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in boredom and the surrounding towns.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, in the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while Western European countries’ response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not appropriate to the situation.
“It’s impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria’s efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attack, noting that the violent reaction of the United States resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the use of hand sanitizers by children in the last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, hand sanitizer revenues in children under the age of 12 reported by poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are getting more and more likely to get these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink disinfectants intentionally, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a taste of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teens have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whiskey stand around, but people leave these hand-held disinfectants within reach of children, and if children do, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four shots of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed at her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and shoved her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand sanitizers out of the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their “common” teacher by designing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banished her from her room.
The police considered the defeated plan to be a "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a collision on the cross-branch between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards the roundabout industrial area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed into the rear of an Audi with his truck and pushed that vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused damage to property of about 10,000 euros, the police informs.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumor Kitchen: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths downplays the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will reverse that again.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be cautious about January recommitments that could destroy the squad's unity
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's penalties in the first half gave Aberdeen a close win over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons created a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down disharmony talk
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which Griffiths spontaneously rejected, insisting that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old-firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10-man Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Getting together now is so important.
Warburton cautious on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new entries and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the Ibrox squad’s unity.
The former head of Brentford said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Miku, in conversation with Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender's Red Card was later lifted - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said, insisting, “I didn’t question integrity, I didn’t comment on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say I won't go back to Tynecastle unless it's playing for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline has to end on the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We’re going to get the guys back on track,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh straight league victory, which earned them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalties in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have not won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 164,000, while the number of people unemployed for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s 5.9 percent unemployment rate was 5.5 percent higher than the UK’s, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
The drunks disturbed the process.
Since the security personnel could not settle the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the disturbers into custody.
A breathing test in a 16-year-old yielded 0.89 per cent.
The teenager was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per cent and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witness to an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except in a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came for the first time in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants it, and you’ll get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have better formulated it,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks that the movement’s public outreach will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I did.
I do not want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this perspective, I will see him die.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded after wet police chase to get out of Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to shut down the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow, swampy water, just a few yards away from a police officer who was trying to “gentlely persuade him to return to the shore.”
Police in Canning Vale were called on Tuesday for a peace-breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape to the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too enthusiastic about getting his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated."
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said senior sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but locals inspired to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching over a race-day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and that he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tapping test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had withheld himself for 18 months over the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it was going on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head raised, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start to think I’m not doing that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had released the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I am doing inside my stables," Moody told Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a scammer.
If that’s the case, they should certainly cling to their noses because they failed in trying to cling to me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should that make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps blames people outside of coaches for what’s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and repudiate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying will make them think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where I don’t care, and it makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach’s frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he “can throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of undefeated master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
Yesterday could have been like this all day, which was the case.
But it was also like that on the race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race. An investigation of this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you’ve gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver flight and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims of wrestling
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has called criticism of tackling his players the "agenda setting" of two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster’s coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to “ringfight” with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a Rugby League "pattern" and saying the two from Queensland weren't "too good" in the fight.
Bellamy defended his team's tacklimb and said they were focused only on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team sounded confident in him, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps coming up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought us the turnaround.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of a crap.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks making and not points something exciting?
For me, it’s the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that at one stage we will still meet them.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday evening in the pre-final at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start next Tuesday morning.
Serbia on $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who may face a life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that it could have been in the café for an innocuous reason.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan was concerned about Maksimovic’s risk of escape.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,” he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to secure his release.
“After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the requirement of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden,” Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police daily, and stick to an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: cab tears apart
In a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried to dodge to the left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's cab was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o’clock.
Damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone as she slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and uncovered “relevant” web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and then he “professed to be a policeman to frighten them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court, “He said it was an addiction to be addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violating the conditions on January 25 of this year, and failing to appear in court at a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear on the sexual offender registry, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
It was included in the list of sexual offenders even before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers avoid small border crossings with Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up outside the large control points on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and dams.
There, they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration.
According to data from the German Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: foothills of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest by Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong low is the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which in recent days had drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour are expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance region until early Thursday.
On Friday, the sun can be seen longer.
The masses are doing it: Every two years, the car manufacturers at the IAA show their innovations.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: According to the German Federal Motor Vehicles Agency (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (Public Days 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at dealerships in autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the show.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is poised to make a start below its biggest competitor, VW Golf, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hesse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is the Opel Astra initially only as a five-door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring by the station wagon, which is already on display at the IAA.
And what is next to the Astra on new compact cars at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door vehicle in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version.
It will go on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: Brand new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan subsidiary wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The base model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with gasoline engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 newton meters (Nm).
The launch of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën offshoot mainly put their hands on the front part: here the radiator grille was redrawn and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernised, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI are joined at the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five-square-meter cell is unworthy of humankind
The Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex-prisoner from the Tegel Prison, who was housed in a cell that was too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in cells that are too small.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were locked up for only a few days in the tight rooms (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
With this, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Prison between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area; the toilet was not separated spatially.
Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now back on his feet, had been moved to a larger cell.
His imprisonment lawsuit for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges set aside the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case for further examination there.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, from the period in question only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, it would be “a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality.”
The court must now determine the amount of the compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
For example, they did not award damages to a prisoner until April because he was locked up in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humans.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had attested to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an inhumane accommodation.
The plaintiff was housed in a cell of the same kind as in the Karlsruhe case for three months between 15 and 21 hours a day.
Berlin prisons have also made headlines in recent weeks due to a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours, aggression increases, even fights are said to have already occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in Tegel have not been filled due to a shortage of young talent, 19 are expected to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and Refugee Policy: “We Can Do It”
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do that."
What is going on in Germany is provided by the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years.
That’s almost twice as much as what has been built so far (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price commitment every year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap housing units.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a support amounting to 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Building Ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Tränhardt.
In Germany, according to Tränhardt, there has been a political turnaround: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The majority of the society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - has prevailed in the view that refugees should be given faster access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to accessing the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not a sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
Therefore, in Tränhardt’s view, the establishment of networks is the king’s way to work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to day care, estimated at 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koshmbar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of daycare, the administration distributes handouts in different languages.
Should the demand for educators increase greatly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students with no knowledge of German are prepared for classes in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient students from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his stance.
Student-willing refugees could be facilitated access to higher education.
Refugees with a residence permit or a toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act when they begin their studies.
In principle, the latter do not receive a bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to bafög.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this range is reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demanded Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic charity that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
Rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take a heartfelt step against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “have immediately their right to reside here, in Germany, forfeited,” he said on Bavarian Radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more an issue than it is today for the whole of society.
As a result, the majority society will also have to change, the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for almost a decade.
But it is very slowly learning, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and to which international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany must become a reality in the coming years, if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as manpower and capacity is concerned, we can do that,” he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money has to go into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand out health cards at the time of registration.
Benefits rendered could later be invoiced with the federal states.
And in the long run, it would be highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services provided for in the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act.
Otherwise, doctors mainly create language barriers.
Already, according to Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are being taught worse about their diseases than other patients.
It is not only in clinics, but also in medical practices that interpreter costs have to be covered, she demands.
Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
However, with the partly other illnesses, German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, perhaps even relief is in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians have an advanced education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
However, to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder or from depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU München shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive in Germany traumatized.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart failure and fears of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe frighteningness, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would usually decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash in the manege on the brick to dream.
“Our passion is the circus.”
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - under this motto stands the current manege production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift to delight the family is in the blood.
“It’s important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours,” says the 27-year-old junior boss.
"Manegencocktail with world-city flair", is what director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometre-long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Lightness and agility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in a storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertip sensitivity and articulation.
Balancing with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpent people fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like little else and fascinates with its mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misfortunes in the posture of circus animals are all too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also commented: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each petting unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are called lovingly, are read from the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to be in the manege.
So the highest commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland Pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the zebroid is not ready for the manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst: “Whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with our whole heart.”
The Circus Probst invites to its performances daily from 17 to 20 September at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11am and 4pm.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Speaks Falsely in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of the parliament was also clouded by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe’s speech with bullshit.
Last month, they had busted him out and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in parliament -- that's the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe’s speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns affected parliamentarians that immunity will end in parliament, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is projected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-saving efforts to service the company.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing company hardware and services business.
The expected job cut will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering previously unmatched, integrated technology solutions to enterprises,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in the industry based on the belief that narrowly focused companies are delivering better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates have to stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten the career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
Premier Injuries Ltd’s investigation records 23 different Wilshere diseases since its debut six years ago.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league matches in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Hector Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to advance through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men’s friendships
The lack of similar depictions in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first in order for a friendship to work.
In the age of communication conducted through social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy luck.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone as a friend through the interaction.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel – all came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As a phone counselor explained to me, “my listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old phrase "I can handle it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on course when Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his debut less than four minutes after starting his Champions League as a PSG player who got the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they not only aim for qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on their way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the goal; he was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed, even though there are certain things we still need to perfect over the course of the season,” Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn’t score another goal or two.”
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which was able to hold a 2-2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was stabbed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger has been referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted why as he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland in the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would score a big win, that was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, competed at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a tough opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp’s posts far in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG sometimes gave up on itself, with some mispasses and bad grades, not least by Ibrahimovic, who was beaten in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then given up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot that was steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to all thinking that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was knocked out a goal in the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough.”
Hat off from Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a share sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn squeezes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencore’s share price to trading early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of its broader plans to pay off around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city council in Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest newcomer is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will respond to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively,” the statement added.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington in Seattle before continuing to travel to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car borrowed and driven to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha, you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was also the case for a 29-year-old from Gotha.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got into the slingshot on a wet road and drove into the guardrail.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 transfer to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
A few years ago, FC Bayern was obviously close to the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight Spanish champions, three cup winners, four Champions League winners, two club world champions, two European champions, one world champion – Xavi’s title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi reveals that he was already ahead of the 2008 European Championship before leaving Barcelona.
“I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me.”
“Madrid won everything then, we didn’t win anything,” he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
However, the change did not take place.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: “Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a signed Guardiola and I played a great EM.”
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's why he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, knocked out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and in the end celebrated the King-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying it wasn’t needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight's Sunday Night, seasoned actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
“When we talk about diversity, you do it when casting the film and not when casting the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the actor's comments of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about — whoever the director will be — how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she's a whore beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People called for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directorial rights to the film; Damon replied that their directorial “could ultimately give us something we don’t want.”
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing, “Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity – that’s SO WHITE it hurts.”
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of societal discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took effect nationwide, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against color.
In February, Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the Grammy Award nominated albums of the year.
"Albums still matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never seen a contest participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The last task involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time period, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about, I’ve never made or had more than $10,000 to live with,” Isaac E. said of his pile of money.
So suddenly... as I can't even imagine what this is like... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, despite being the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time will get it,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life-changing, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by anyone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins squandered a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Astros for second American League wildcard place.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word, which was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All victories are fun no matter how it comes,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to end this year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in bullpen, so I want to get into the game very focused.
Designated tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the percussion well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in the (beat training), looked much better in bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overcame Mauer, the only man he was faced with, ahead of rookie-designate Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall managed an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, scoring 5-4.
The right-hander, however, slashed Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from an as yet unmovable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wished for," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt like I was going to create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff drummer in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who made a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of play as he tried to make it to third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers went down in the second, scoring a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn’t do very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, not scoring points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez dropped out due to a shoulder injury.
It is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list due to a shoulder tear, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris has been 1-1 on four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a distortion in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It was estimated that between 450 and 750 refugees would arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government office responsible for the initial admission, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria to be a possibility.
“I believe that the decisive reflection on military options cannot take place without Germany,” he said.
He accused the European states of “collective gazing away”.
Four years ago we were glad that the chalice of military involvement passed Germany.
“Now the conflict is crashing at our doorstep,” he told Germany Radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees on the ground.
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on Austrian TV station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
“No, that’s agreed,” she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks on this between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees next Tuesday (22 September) at a special meeting.
In view of the high number of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to support the countries more strongly in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four-hour discussions with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those who needed protection would get it too.
But those who do not have a prospect of staying can not stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometre-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking escape routes via Romania, Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, thousands more migrants were reportedly on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe Cassini finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice armor of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean swarms.
Researchers conclude this from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini".
According to this, the moon is slightly tumbling in its orbit around the ring planet.
This movement is only small, but still too large for a continuously solid celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon in 2006 that spew water vapor and ice particles, feeding Saturn's so-called E-ring.
At least on the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich had to do without offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has revealed an additive injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained about pain earlier this week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of compulsory break".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a heartbreaking loss."
"Of course we have to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper, looking at the possible commitment of a non-union professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously also under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is to enter running training.
Okotie had injured herself in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision on the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious injury.
No diet fruit - mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slender line, are often discouraged by them.
Because mangos contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste pure or in sweet food.
But a mango also gives savoury dishes a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is hiring up to 95,000 aides for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are especially wanted.
Last year, UPS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95000 aides.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements to prepare for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First blow blown, then marked cold front
The next night, the Föhn breaks through in the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, as Meteo-Switzerland announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the Föhn blows partly with storm force through the Föhn valleys.
After Föhnend on Thursday morning, we are crossed by a distinctive cold front, which brings heavy rains, wind gusts and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwestern current.
On the north side of the Alps, the Föhn breaks through the valleys at night on Wednesday.
As a result, the Föhn blows until Thursday morning in the Föhn valleys with gusts from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in Urnerland sometimes with more than 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can occasionally penetrate into the adjoining middlelands, and on the mountains even hurricane waves of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stall on the Alps south slope.
This is where rain falls, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected, this after having already fallen in the last few days large amounts of rain.
On Thursday morning, the air runs out of the Föhn, and a cold front rolls with strong, partly fierce rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools strongly to stormy, and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south, on the weekend it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on Oppio Hill was christened in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now recognized as "German Theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming was requested by the Association of Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the Popes, as a minority for centuries, could often only live their faith in secret.
The square makes it symbolically visible that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
He perceived the city at that time as a depraved babel of sins.
His negative impressions, according to historians, may have strengthened him in his later battle with Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the indulgence trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have emerged that deal with topics such as the Cross, plagues, commandments or Our Father.
With this, he immediately fascinated several partners: this applies to Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into the present, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt's painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who formulates here his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows a double insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lord Huter Order.
“The education has already happened with the cane,” recalls Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to work this out, perhaps to get along with the Lord Father again.”
His second aim was to make art more important in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds today is shaped by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this respect, I am a dinosaur.”
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to let themselves "indulge" in the images, let them act on themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings".
Old did not take care to fully comprehend the Bible, but chose the subjects that were important to him, even mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction for BMX track is approaching
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, earth hill modeled for a circuit: A year later, almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX track, it was already over.
Failures in politics and administration caused distress, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill removed, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be received in October, the First Town Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to announce now in the Children and Youth Committee.
“I hope that something visible will happen this year,” she said.
The work on the former indoor swimming pool should then be started without "further remembrance break".
DFB Intensifies Engagement for Refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear sign on the weekend.
Football reacts to the escalating situation in Germany and assures the politicians of its help in addressing the problems ahead.
“I consider this to be the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification.”
“No one can say in principle that it’s not my business, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It has to be in everyone's interest to get this issue under control," said DFB CEO Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and will meet the Minister of State Ms. Özo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive course must be taken by politics.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Through the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," Niersbach said at the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Germans also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will make a clear sign if they will wear the imprint "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," Leverkusen's sporting director Rudi Völler told the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "of course".
“The refugee drama is about everyone, nobody can look away.”
“We can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
For the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary on Friday, the women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
That all 36 licensing clubs had started their own projects in their locations is great.
It’s just as great that small and small clubs are active.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, is lived in football.
“This is of enormous importance,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government, will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach said.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye in a crash in early July.
In the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a glass of water that he had carried in his left hand, the "Wirtschaftswoche" reported on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeding, fainted, then dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott was able to do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday issue) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told the SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can do something like this."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore not eligible as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as well as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been shattered.
The national player will also miss the leader of the Bundesliga in the duel with FC Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 p.m./Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be there again on Sunday in the Bundesliga top match against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to training on Friday".
Given the heavy burden of his pros, Tuchel will not only change his tribal eleven on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That’s why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of his regular keeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, Tuchel left open.
He is also likely to play the second game.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, thinks midfielder Julian Weigl is understandable: "That's not Marco's so wrong."
“I think we have a good chance to win the title.”
Robotic cars: government wants to be a pioneer for Germany
According to the will of the German government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for, among other things, investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor show of a "new age of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic jams, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on motorway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology.
In order to ensure that the driver is not burdened with additional liability risks, the German government wants to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments.
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the permissible top speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The federal government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becoming more and more the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Despite this, driverless vehicles on public roads are “only far to be expected after 2020”.
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site is estimated by the authors of the study to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the security of drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars to be used by 2025, while in the United States, 33 percent.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, that could be imagined in flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in traffic jams 45 percent.
Almost one in four would not be left to control the car under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current state of play in the title fights from 25 September to 4 October, the Düsseldorfer only wants to play in detail.
The final decision will be made on 22 September at the latest.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on a long-term sponsorship date in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said European singles champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the lineup in Yekaterinburg, also remembered the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we became European champions."
"This is what we should focus on," the World Ranking 5 said.
English footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis in the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger indicated a fracture of the shin.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented on Wednesday in Munich an exhibition about his work.
The highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, with Madonna’s stage outfits became the great star of the fashion scene – and with that he put men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I am the terrible child of haute couture because I have white hair.”
“Previously it was bleached, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on view in the Hypo Cultural Foundation's art hall from September 18, it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about himself.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been stationed in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful dresses,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly yet to be seen work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
Chronologically, the show is not constructed, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort was made: For example, a stylist was engaged in order to hairstyle the dolls.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers have carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was another special treat: a leather trouser outfit with corset.
- Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and in people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, timid, fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll would not have been allowed by his parents.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he was unable to pay for the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen were about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, who, for example, processed them further into blankets and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Fashion-Spitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen tip, fashion played a greater role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, forms an increasing order potential.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Fashion Spitze Plauen is a member of the industry association Plauen Spitze and Embroidery.
Only you are allowed to wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have fallen.
Private specialty stores and also wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
The mass goods are nowadays produced much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are plenty of reasons for new ways.
As Cordula Bauer of the embroidery pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have had a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg office of the West-Saxon University of Applied Arts Zwickau and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to oppose the competition from the Asian region, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small beads in some places.
Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I couldn't do anything with traditional Plauen tip".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it imprints the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
With this I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen Spitze.
Disney is planning a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still daring to make a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, this is not about a new film, but a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It’s about the nanny’s experiences with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi pushes to open up the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday to a group tasked with steering the reform.
“China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies,” he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Fostering new start-ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), incorporation of private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensures a legal-state business environment, and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also ease controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of third-party financed companies and provide better services to them,” the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee the exercise of their duties and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish, giving consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force to pregnant women and young children," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predators are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold on the basis of the limits still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch described this as a "trick" because smaller friedfish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore “a perfidious distraction maneuver that helps the economy alone,” Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and is highly enriched throughout the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The German government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies."
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its homepage that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
According to a written report from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, German coal power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively exceeded", the "Spiegel" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, pan-European mercury warnings in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
