DFB CEO Grindel sees no basis for Özil comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on getting into a conversation, talking to him about why he apparently felt one or the other as set out in his statement," Grindel told the Bild-Zeitung in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher".
Despite the months-long debate over the photos of Ozil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time national player Ozil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
De 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it with the fact that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that if you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a shame that this conversation has not been achieved so far.
Linz: Garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergartensiedlung, the danger was in arrears.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be removed practically entirely and fire debris removed to the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had plugged in a battery for charging at noon.
This could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the range of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collectibles in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Resists: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Road
What only led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live as she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you see "Happily Kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses adult children of trafficking.
For all this she provides no evidence in the clip.
“The whole world is watching this right now,” Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses a slap in the ear.
In tears, the actress then affirms how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 spacecraft launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is said to be so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, there are at least 420 deaths reported.
The number of victims could go up even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk Resigns as Tesla Chairman
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused stock market unrest in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but the two have now agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla's chief executive is withdrawing from the board of directors, but he is allowed to remain chairman of the board.
Conservative Party of the United Kingdom
Sharply guarded - the party congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party congress is set to discuss foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over these name duplications for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is to be called North Macedonia in the future and on this Sunday the population will vote on it - whether it is well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” is an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His closest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” Chief Development Officer Peter Mertens told Automotive Week.
Audi chief Rupert Stadler, who was imprisoned and on leave, announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested,” he said.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important milestone in the process of resolving the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "serious organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wants to continue to discuss it on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi chief of having authorized the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the exhaust frauds became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, is currently managing the company as interim Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust gas and fuel consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said Schot the "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
The e-tron, the first Audi electric car, already has 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run for DFB president again next year despite criticism of him after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
"I'm doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Aktuelle Sportstudio" early Sunday morning.
We have to keep trying to win re-election, and I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
The head of the association, in his own words, would find it "strange" if after the contract for the football EURO 2024, he did not have "a pleasure to collaborate on the future project".
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place on DFB-Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organiser Philipp Lahm is expected to collaborate with the DFB presidency.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to advise on this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, will be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background should become an integration ambassador of the DFB.
Currently, this office is held by Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one without a migration background that has a significant impact on society and football and says, 'the issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," Grindel said.
Lose weight properly with a semi-smart scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but that is more for the sausage.
Doesn't he say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscles?
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening sequences for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball-Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the runner-up won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The committed national player from Ludwigsburg, Johannes Thiemann (18 counters), also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his compulsory game debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the compulsory debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counts.
Last year’s playoff semifinalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the safest shooter in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a significant success.
In the basketball team Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new game maker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 counts.
The Braunschweiger, with whom NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne city centre had been partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were in action, including snipers.
The Islamist federation Ditib is under criticism because it is considered the extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Shouts and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been promoting more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a concert in New York’s Central Park.
“Commit wherever you can,” Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and a gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations, also showed themselves on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was fired, became afraid and tried to flee.
Shortly there was a panic, people ran into confusion.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people from the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet every year.
Anyone who wanted to catch one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - buhrufe on the other hand for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke with his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, pushing many women to the head.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after he was confronted by two women who allegedly experienced sexual assault on their own on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet me anytime in an elevator," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends journalist's eviction
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist’s ejection from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
In the Chancellery the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had overlaid a t-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the front row.
The t-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
As a result of the journalist’s action, there was a strong unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he caused the personal guard to take the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not safe from the Turkish authorities: it was only at the beginning of September that Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of imprisoned journalists Me<0xC5><0x9F>ale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused a stir.
They were released and were able to return to Germany, but there are still lawsuits against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
As fresh and eye-catching as his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humidly cheerful conversations at the counter of the Hamburg port pub "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guests come across some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing inserts.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time around: actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip to the high north did not go well for Munich.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely washed out Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite serious - findings, which he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sow.
And splash.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half past three, also leave it.
The alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to fight the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broths, fish rolls or - presumably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others were simply amused by the sight of the normally attractive movie star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal sackcloth.
Since she has moderated the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and filth
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hood Land in Treysa is difficult to find and garbage.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and garbage, demolished rubbish bins and meanwhile dismantled signs - this is how the entrance with a seating group to the cycle path on the Haasse hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
A more than infamous sight for the flagship object Railway bike path in the Red Riding Hood Land.
The topic has occupied members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling commissioner of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," Wüstenhagen says.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also contributed the topic to the local council.
It’s not just the garbage that drives cyclists and residents around – the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebrations on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, the beds are also destroyed: posts ripped from the ground, trash cans demolished, signs bent over, seating furniture smeared.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You are annoyed that the resting place at the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for sausage.
"Along the entire cycle path, the focus here is clearly on the Haasse hill," confirms the cycling official, who is now also concerned about the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Perhaps this puts the threshold significantly higher to engage in communal property.
However, this would require that a police rally will pass in a timely manner.
Basically, Wüstenhagen wants a development of the Haasse hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequentation of the cycle path so far one could be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert sees the situation in Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical hazard.
There is no turning lane on the Haasse hill.
In busy traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between traffic flows on both sides,” she explains.
This is not a problem for athletic drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in coexistence.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup District Offensive, in the "Music Contest for young and experienced musicians big and small".
A contest "with a wink in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family get-together with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Immig, a long-lived albanist living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrupper Sternfarben", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Rike Kindergarten and finally the Lummerland.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We have not seen this in other areas of the city.
What did the writers relate to?
The Hiltruper See and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig chose the avenue in his song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also honored.
Time and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short conversion breaks with short interviews with the performers or hints about their work.
So they learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others can also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can play an entire CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Immig with his Hiltrup-Schlag, which particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and sounded "right well" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She considered the event a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very crowded cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each page there is a visual screen, in it four cards with keywords, which you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - only when you have put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything even accidentally.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3. Dice.
4. Fest."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not a question of terms, but of codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card that says "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team, if possible, does not; because this wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to Fest; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prague" because he has watched in school and knows the window fall there.
That’s how it goes round by round, team by team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side, it can be better matched with any hint that the encryptor gives there.
The descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too twisted, so otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule booklet.
The players will probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail before they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But those who have started will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if it’s just about guessing and not about winning points, you can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler salute and molests guests in pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First, he showed the Hitler salute in the Upper Town of a passing police force, later he also found himself in a pub in the Upper Town when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized and failed to comply with the ban issued by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must then also be criminally responsible for the use of markings of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway operating plant in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers were banging at buffers, you heard it in all the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't bother anyone.
Then the brakes squealed and the wagons cracked.
It was pure railroad.
Statements that stand symbolically for Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which after an elevation of about 220 meters has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and shoe blocks, which had their home in Pressig, were needed in the past.
In 1901, the Bavarian state legislature approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, driving line and railway mastery.
"The heart was the turntable, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47-year-old professional railroader.
The BW Pressig railway company, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam engines and eight ellochs were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and thrust blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weighing units were placed in the month.
In 1982 parts of the plant were demolished, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that a better use of the site, also in terms of freight transport, has not been envisaged."
Still at Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous station festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later the out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig Ranging Station was history.
"The rangers and obstacle trainers did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any wrongdoing would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber wins China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Darya Kassatkina, when the Russian, who was ranked 13th, gave up.
The sister-in-law now gets to deal with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the "Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, organizers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association "Round about Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A huge amount of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist alike.
A bit surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have actively participated in the selection of artists in the past and contributed to the design of flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there will be a special 70-cent stamp designed by them, available at any art station.
There you can also buy this year's poster "Betzn tanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high popularity of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing, Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won.
As the visitor walks through the spacious garden, it quickly becomes clear that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a stump, brightened in color, playfully provided with 20 wind wheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bush in the background, the object seems fairy-tale-like and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental, who preferentially devotes herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
Halfway through, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "Der Wind das himmlische Kind".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 – this was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also made air of their displeasure at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to settle for the fact that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sang life in the district.
It has now become a legend: On a bench in the Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 albates from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated largely in the "House of Encounter".
"It's getting full today," President Jürgen Holstiege predicted, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
For the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
Just in time for its 50th anniversary, the tradition festival was back.
An elegant ball it had been asked for for festive clothing beforehand.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "House of Encounter" in rows of seats, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was needed: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albaten themselves made the voice sound.
The occasion was accompanied by cheerful songs.
He said, “A day like this, as beautiful as today.”
Fitting the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin name for "hops".
Again, the choir conducting was sovereign by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "he has such a light kind of thing, it's a masterpiece he performs." By the way, this time it wasn't just men who presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat at the desk until three o’clock in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well-sounding poetry.
There was also a big tombola.
The proceeds are to be financed for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre a visit to the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marched.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite good in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city rival BW Aasee really good.
"That was not crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a later birthday party of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get to the finish, a game like this can tip over," knows Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to its goal.
"We all know who's on the other side of a derby like this.
It won't break our neck.
I have seen really good volleyball at times," Annacker did not fight with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the trip goes for the independents seems not to be foreseeable after just three days of play.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
They don’t want to look downwards into the fourth league anymore.
If the vest is not soiled in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will take place in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly that the series may have been part of her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018, she left for good.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired saw me on an equal footing," Keller tells the "Bild am Sonntag".
At first, she had always been "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
“Whether he liked it so much, I don’t know.”
She believes it is possible that her husband at the time could have been quite jealous, but “like many men, Hans shunned conversations about problems and feelings.”
Keller has always tried to be the only one for Hans von Borsody and he wanted to not know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve misplaced myself,” she explains.
She always felt like she wasn’t good enough for him.
He saw me as an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I sometimes seemed brazen and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time."
The day before the official wedding, I sat crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why didn't it ever work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had imagined love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I was too naive about love.”
The night butterfly, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ-Ressort Zurich, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our butterfly is not a moth, but a little shy of light.
And the bright glow, in which a green carpet is immersed in the hexagon square, dazzles him too much.
But it is still a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
So on this late Thursday night, he tumbles across the square to briefly ease himself in the "Aquaclean WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the requisite facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion is making a great effort to pour out a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it smells like heaven in the Herren-Oase for some reason.
So get out here, head over to the other side of the road: invited guests, who have just entertained the opening film "Green Book" at the cinema next door at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store as every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: it is known that the works shown are from all over the world.
What do you have to think about an article about this festival not everything in order not to fall into misleading advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly binds a ribbon around the feelers, which has given him a good fairy, and two bustling doorkeepers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the guests crowd, they dance to live music long after midnight or let DJs presume rhythms to which they shout at each other, and rinse down exquisite snacks with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen shop in the basement, oysters are waiting for slicking mouths, next door, the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: All the shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The butterfly studies the sign at the escalator: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If this is two separate instructions, he has misplaced himself in the dress code.
But it’s more of a conditional construction, and it certainly has already saved lives.
In the household goods department upstairs, the poultryman tipped a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not mandatory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting the brand for years, isn't here that evening either.
But between local prominence, cash and kitchen items, a face passes by that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main character should not be far away.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with soon sixty almost acting like a choir boy.
He is not squeaked, he is not squeaked, he is squeaked at most.
Precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as constriction, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with his team’s victory.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled well in his new homeland of Mexico.
After a 2-0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, cheered by the players.
The Mexican runner-up defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my guys, always".
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last minute score "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association league ASV Send, could hardly believe: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long phases, the senders.
Only the initial phase "we fell asleep completely", the ASV coach was annoyed.
The landlords quickly ran with 8:1, even the early break Bieletzki had taken did not bear fruit at first.
"But then suddenly a jolt went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter-hour.
For the break, the backlog was only two more goals.
Especially Sendens Best, Marius Hintze, met once again in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from the point of view of the visitors.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalled to 15:15, then the season changer ran almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then what?
Take the impartial into action.
Bieletzki usually guards himself against seeking the blame of others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected was "a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also stood well against seven men in the back and thrown again and again on the empty gate.
Only you can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," says the fully-served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hugging (1).
Bavaria: Woman has been missing for 30 years - police digs for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof district), police are looking for the remains of the woman.
Rescuers dug a road at Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers under it were removed, as police and prosecutors shared.
According to new findings, the missing woman may not have been buried far away from her home at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
Investigators did not rule out a crime at that time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court and the Public Prosecutor’s Office have been working again intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Conservation Authority, the investigators came across a conspicuousness underneath the street near Marxgrün by means of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the odor of human bones, the officials confined the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his impending resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an out-of-court dispute over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to conduct publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk resigns as chairman for three years, a position comparable to the head of the German supervisory board.
The chief executive may remain against it.
In the comparison, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager in the U.S. federal court Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk isn't aware of any guilt.
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the spirit of truth, transparency and investors.
On Aug. 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock market and pay $420 per share, the financing being secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion.
Musk later rowed back: Tesla remains on the stock market.
Following the deal, Tesla must now find an external chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1:1 at FC Chelsea
FC Liverpool came to a 1-1 match with FC Chelsea.
In the top game at FC Chelsea, the attacker just replaced by coach Jürgen Klopp in the 89th minute ensured the 1:1 (0:1).
After six wins at the start Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remains third, new top rider is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard led Chelsea in the 25th minute with his sixth goal of the season.
Afterwards, the Klopp team missed the compensation several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo from Liverpool's goalkeeper Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a slender in the corner.
Record champion Manchester United is slipping deeper and deeper into crisis after the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven games only in the table midfield.
Pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match against FC Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after an injury to Petr Cech.
Before the Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won by goals from Raheem Sterling (29th) and Sergio Agüero (65th) 2-0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used in the new top rider.

Joachim Llambi has separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known through the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Bild am Sonntag" (Bezhal content) reports, citing Llambi's lawyer, on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel to be Chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past weeks, GroKo collects several survey lows.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
The AfD overtook the SPD for the first time nationwide in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by a count to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a count and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were to take place on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the vote, according to Emnid.
With this, the great coalition has currently lost the majority on the Sunday question at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The governing parties consistently win 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received 53.4 percent.
Among the other parties, the range is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second largest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach vote shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards, depending on the share of the vote.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also dropped significantly since the 2017 federal election.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, according to the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS.
According to the survey, only one in two (50 percent) currently wants the big coalition to hold until the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there were also significant declines in popularity for Merkel.
Divided Germans are also judging whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
47 percent are for it, according to Emnid, 44 percent are against it.
For the Union supporters, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Exhibit with Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says there are no romantic acquaintance stories in Tinder's time should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for the great love radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer shorts bargain at the Wühltisch or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a contact, but rather a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react when you don’t talk about the hot porridge for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
Rule-right Hollywood lovestory potential is when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the guy then also contacts his loved one at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch<0x40>gmx.de, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this announcement in an Aldi-filial unknown to us quite wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she spoke briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic pig meat".
For her belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserved her Happy End <0xC3><0xA0> la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischule has been participating in the campaign "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without pediatric paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease referred to in German as paediatric paralysis leads from paralysis symptoms to death.
Polio is considered extinct in Germany, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be curbed by vaccinations, according to a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand calm for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about shape and fitness of Mario Götze.
“We should stop worrying about Mario.
That doesn't do the boy any good.
And that doesn't do us any good," Reus, a friend of idols, told Sky after the 4-2 victory in Leverkusen.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: Don't rush into contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday night.
Football: Bezirksliga: VfL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrheine encourages researchers
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his sons.
Wortkarg, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first retired (inside) to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it is again running around the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only narrowly past the climb.
Yes, I am very pleased with the performance.
“We’ve made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out each individual for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more stakes in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his end (17th), the interchanged Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have avenged itself when the SCA hit the Wolbecker Box twice in person in minute 41 of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer dangerously - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his skill.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes entry.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbaumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick in front of the guest casing.
The foulman competed himself and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right flap hit the bottom left from the shooter's view - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes to be damned long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather in the penalty area unhappy at the hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to survive for a few minutes in the final phase before Geske had the winning goal on the push in the 87th minute from 12 meters.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five game days - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure the first home win.
Striker Ante Rebic, who was in the starting eleven for the first time after an injury, should help.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also back after an injury and should with his headball strength prevent the SGE from collecting further goals according to standards.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
At around 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
The landing of a helicopter caused turbulence, police confirmed to oe24.
The heli was caught by a gust of wind, crashed to the ground and came to a halt laterally.
Immediately, police, rescue and fire departments were notified.
With a large convoy, the emergency forces arrived at the site of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency helicopter was also called in for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one property damage.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigation.
According to fire spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small outbreak of fire, which could, however, be quickly extinguished again.
Allbright Foundation report: Women remain a rarity in boards of directors
Only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and was presented to the German Press Agency in advance.
“Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them,” said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with few exceptions – are far from conceivable.
The backlog makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the share of women among German stock exchange companies was also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDAX).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still at 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
“I’m sure that the Dax companies will be recruiting consistent women again next year – in their own interest,” said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will continue to make no commitment to increase the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture emerges from the Supervisory Boards: As of 1 September, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ago.
“If as many women were recruited annually for the boards of directors, a share of 40 percent would have been reached by 2023,” the report said.
Some even make mischief: luxury cars: which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold in the first half of the year, while Jaguar Land Rover only made around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put a lot of effort on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices of on average 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.
On the day of her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she will be a mother for the first time.

Torch train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the tourist association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the association organizes the wine festivals, which from now on climb every Saturday in October in the large festival tent on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the jubilee, the responsible people moved under the sounds of the playmen’s train from Wiesenbronn through the place to the festival site.
The chairman of the tourist association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already abundant festive tent.
You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine princess Lisa II later symbolically met the guests from the stage.
"Beautiful that so many have found their way to us again after Abtswind." Later "Die Troglauer" caused mood.
On Sunday, when the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drink prices as it did 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
An evening for the 60th Wine Festival takes place on Friday, October 5, at the guest’s house, before going into the second round a day later in the festival tent.
In Bonn: Emergency car crashes in taxi
An emergency car stands heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
When emergency doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best of all, save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn ended deadly for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old woman was fatally injured in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency physician and her driver were seriously injured, police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then came across a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's trolley threw a traffic light pole and a tree.
He caught the woman who died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency forces.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old emergency physician was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried to do so, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
In close consultation with the Bonn Public Prosecutor’s Office, the police determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
Manchester United are losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat is likely to be discussed.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the resurrected Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all the defenders of Manchester stopped, and let Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously insufficient performance over long distances.
The situation at United’s Manchester City city rival is very different.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola, came to an approximate 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defensive bar of the outsider for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1-1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-End, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute remained the only hit of the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless record, Chelsea was therefore not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2-0 victories.
The fans of the Gunners, with whom Granit Xhaka played, had to wait until the 81st minute for a success report against the surprise team from the County of Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart made an unfortunate entry from Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal passed Watford for the fifth time in a row and is just behind the great rival Tottenham in 5th place, leaving a strong impression on Wolverhampton's rising under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league 2–0 against Southampton for the fifth time in a row, occupying 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Paris auto show under the sign of diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet ubiquitous: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not let the German car companies go unnoticed at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will show their innovations from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel no longer plays a big role.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which until then are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important issue, at least behind the shiny backdrop of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is present with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have among other things their first pure electric models: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is expected to be on the market at the end of the year, the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
BMW’s iNext is scheduled to launch in 2021.
In Paris, the focus is on the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were more than a million visitors.
At least 380 people died in the earthquakes and tsunami that followed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had a strength of 5.9, the second a strength of 7.4.
Communication and transport links have been damaged, there has been enormous property damage.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will increase significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
Numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi's west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a team of helpers the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking was owned by motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral care of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle worship service (MoGo) takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of the month.
The cyclists traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to perform a worship service that was anything but ordinary.
Already from 10 o’clock the bolides were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker’s early snack was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a hearty curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker service Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical background was provided by the singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
“Although bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill is more poetic-quiet,” said Frank Schröder.
Yesterday, too, this was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle worship.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big party: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pies.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazed spectators step by step the process from the ripe apple to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and had them fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely shredded mass.
Still, many of the children could not imagine how this should become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the bits of apple that looked like chopped goods layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer had already bottled specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest feather white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents met, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built-up bouncing castle for themselves.
Active members of the Fuchtor comradeship of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
In the coming year, the home club will also offer a day of action.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: after all, it will be about the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with fourth-season lead: "Fucked situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed pros from Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last of the table in Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-year-old football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed: "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The still unsuccessful Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for the follow-up, stand with two counters at the very bottom and are in their current constitution a candidate for descent.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome, advanced with seven points to the middle of the table in front of 46,300 spectators.
Croatia’s runner-up Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous Hesse offensive during his debut at the start of the eleven and never got under control of Hanover’s defense.
The long-beaten striker after the World Cup showed with his pace and assertiveness why he is so valuable for the Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started with vigor.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s headball falsified on the goal net posed danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defense of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the landlords fell almost inevitably and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a defensive corner, Haller prolonged by head in front of the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defending player who came in the summer of the French second league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt slept before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who skilfully impregnated himself and 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser gave no chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak idea of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt two new offensive forces.
The Lower Saxony were now playing a little more boldly forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when after all the connection hit still succeeded.
The Hesse were much more efficient.
After about an hour Rebic started a solo and then placed across on De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against overwhelmed guests only show, also Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix square becomes a party mile
Despite the cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, made it in front of millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Feast on September 14th or the Sunday after.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Church of the Holy Cross is home to the shot Christ, who dates from the 30-year war and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not yet finished, only the altar room stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Feast of the Cross ended.
For many years now, the Catholic Church Choir has been inviting Catholic parishes to the secular part of the feast.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon the parish still offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, roof, the sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been standing for some time, the damages could be detected more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damages already present a few years ago have become greater, but more has also been found, which was only possible by the in-eye appearance by means of scaffolding.
The base plasterwork is completed, before the winter, the natural stone work is to be started and it is hoped that half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to his destiny - all those present agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider aisles, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began around eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put to the test for the residents with a mobile phone cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer contemporary in the equipment," Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators arrived to tear down the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around €4.6 million was invested in the new building.
The Free State allocated 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both temporally and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The balance between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof design has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Gertrud Kreutmayer, the head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents, who need tools to be mobile".
The homeliness and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
"The property in this situation is a real luck, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
In total, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers space for 30 people with disabilities on almost 1500 square meters, which are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe-Geschäftsführer Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to tariff.
Germany: Schwesig laments differences between East and West
Before the day of unity, SPD Deputy Federal President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to settle for the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania told the "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average worked longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less salary.
“I can’t explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Will this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
Moon’s office said the two dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get used to.
The dogs with the thick white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The pledge of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to compete in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the reciprocal rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria’s moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this commemorative year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in view of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on 1 October.
A new week, a new opportunity for the government
Back to factual work - this is the unofficial motto for the work week of the Great Coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU recently did not summon the "return to substantive work" mantra-like.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and otherwise working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and in-depth work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself again to its mandate - to governing - it should not be deterred by conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and blamage of the last weeks, will perhaps already show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to defuse conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First, however, with the diesel retrofits and the skilled workers’ immigration law, conflicting issues are once again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchanging premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has marked a rapprochement over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart on the planned skilled workers immigration law.
The SPD calls for a prospect of staying for rejected asylum seekers who are working or doing an education.
The Union is firmly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will again be disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It wasn’t Equal and Equal that joined forces at GroKo, but three partners with very different societal views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society of so diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be raised again for party reasons on the question of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people's lives.
What is feasible and benefits many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
Above all, this is what the people’s parties have to fight for.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visier
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the current employment law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists had worked on the social security reform, an exuberant social minister reported at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) stuns list mushroom mandatar Daniela Holzinger - she now brings the matter to parliament via inquiry.
“The Minister only expressed her enthusiasm for the use of her team and did not want to announce any violations of applicable service law in front of cameras.”
However, she now has questions in order to “free Har-Tinger of any suspicion.”
Police break up a road in search of women's corpse
Marxgrün - The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is being dug.
The track is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
It was preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to confine the relevant area to a few meters, together with its guide in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the street in cooperation with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian conservation authority.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s office and the court’s criminal police have been working on the missing persons case.
Again and again a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and investigated with sonar devices, because investigators suspect that Heike’s body could have been hidden here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia celebrates for the first time.
But there are riots already before.
The separatists did not forget the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, clashes between separatists and police have occurred in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence advocates, among other things, with powder of color, as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the national police and the civil guard.
Around 3,000 officers of the police units Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in use in the polling stations last year in the referendum, which was classified as illegal.
Attempting to prevent citizens from casting their votes had also led to violence.
The Catalan police have formed a chain to keep separate demonstrations of separatists and central state security forces, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, and the officers threw colored bags and eggs, among others.
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured, the authorities said.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to secede the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under compulsory administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-prison.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the inauguration of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Gathered inconvenience: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split without a goal
Red-and-white Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewaldstadion, the final light and the third last revealed them as assembled inconsistency.
The first half was quite manageable by the entertainment factor.
Those who wanted to get a beer or a sausage could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a chance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility the Ahlener had, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty area boundary.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed just above the casing from 18 meters and after an hour the Gütersloher also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ball capture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The swiftly presented counter over Sinan Aigün "crowned" Nick Flock (62nd) with a light shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they played with a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than visual superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not succeed.
It wasn’t until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but neither did it.
Angelo Daut then tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also at the front.
"This time we were not as dangerous as against Holzwickede and even though our opponent did not want to play here," said RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, he "scratched everything so a bit" against a team "that just wanted to defend.
I didn’t feel like we could get a goal,” Daut said.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, one did not have the feeling that his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Erntedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough creimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafelausgabenstelle, for which these donations are intended, are pleased.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the place was still a bit empty, but that was to change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it is so beautiful sociable, that's why we are here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a neat touch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was actually to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creepers.
And the "replacement" could not be avoided to entertain the ever-increasing number of visitors musically in the meantime.
This was so good that some folk songs were sung late.
"Simply great," said Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many active people with their booths, mainly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he thanked the men's choir for the action.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those who were in action at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paint - here is something.
Then the Maikranz was removed by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and brought to the winter quarters.
Many stalls were worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only been living in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative with his decoupier saw.
He had veneer work, beer lids with rectangular motifs and much more on offer.
A specialty offered three beekeepers: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in a glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to access it again and again, so the cake tasted good.
It is the conviviality that allowed the visitors to linger long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the Fall Festival.
Lubrications with local policy message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have advertised in a hardly conducive way for the construction of a skate park.
At several points there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been charged with property damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed on signs, among others, at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the professional election fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message at the time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, it could easily be removed.
"A few days later, it was there again, this time sprayed," says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign needs to be replaced.
This case is particularly noteworthy in that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate plant is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department School, Sport and Culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the smeared board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one at the LWL clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the fire department parking lot.
However, this intention was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turnaround followed.
The members of the Main and Finance Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
As things stand, Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
It is based on a decision this year so that it could be built in a positive vote in 2019.
Air traffic bottlenecks become even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aviation chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic control union, told the German press agency ahead of the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known shortage of personnel in European air traffic controllers, for which there is no quick solution.
“Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots will take four to five years,” he said.
Across Europe, the market for ready-trained pilots has been swept away.
Around a hundred people were missing in the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic city, representatives of the federal government, countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work constraints and overtime, it will not go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German Air Traffic Control.
Maas once again blamed the EU Commission for the Lotsen misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings in the national air traffic control systems are now fully impacting the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) in Brussels to advocate for regulations that "do not further restrict air traffic control".
Currently, the EU requirements are being agreed by 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobbying pressure from airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown themselves in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of the airlines will initiate a rethinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Traffic Control (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The so far announced annual admission of 120 flight attendants over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related dropouts.
The necessary staffing is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board Votes for Group Conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis-ridden group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no further reduction of personnel beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two resignations, the control panel on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to be made by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is expected to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence at demos of police officers and Catalan proponents of independence.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence demonstrators.
The Catalan police have tried with a large force to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the security forces, however, pro-independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and throwing shots.
According to the reports, there were also ranks between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescuers, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to the colleagues who had acted almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they raped us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, dismissed the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues “did not come to provoke,” the policeman assured.
Failure to allow access to personal data of British Minister
A vulnerability in a mobile app has meant that the personal data of ministers and MPs of the conservative British Tory party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party congress in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the police in Hanover reported a serious traffic accident on the federal road 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.

Football: Juve coach praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker had "played the best game together with the half-hour of Valencia this evening", Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star bought without his own goal was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and he’s doing it well,” Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goals, Juve turned the game after the early lag by Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung up the worst pursuer for the time being.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid initially gave up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And after a corner with a header, Ronaldo also made the preliminary work to the goal of defense boss Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to push in before the goal line.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record scorer.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach said.
The best Juve goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the supremacy of Juventus seems to be becoming even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. At 21 points the champion of the past seven years has already six counters ahead of Naples.
The runner-up from former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the dismissal of the already warned Mario Rui (58.) the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the field after entering too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also able to feel at home.
The German national player has won at Juve.
The pro from FC Liverpool was in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flew off the court in the 2-0 victory of the Turiners and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West has garnered attention on the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" over the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, let’s just call him “yes,” according to the musician.
“The being that was formerly known as Kanye West,” he tweeted, referring to the late singer Prince, who dropped his artist name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
“I believe ‘yes’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” the rapper said.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmar’s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
It was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more grippy, we almost never put him in trouble." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer shooting possibilities reads thinly.
Grade two chances in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Fußball-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first pass, but the first one used Maik Krause from an acute angle for early guidance (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have raised Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause, he settled free-standing.
The hosts had only a double chance when at first Moritz Höne to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher failed and in the aftershock Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stitched the ball over the line was the game decided (81st).
“We had previously criticized each other very badly, so today it was different than in the last few weeks,” Florian Kraus said.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think of it,” he cried.
"We didn't get access to them at all," he supposedly meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites who noticed with a collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, winking cheeky and moved from there to His players, on the other hand, was the relief to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Notably, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albats, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
“That was by far our best performance in the season,” he says.
"How we come back after the 0-2, how we're against one of the top teams in the league all season long, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to go home empty-handed.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2-0 he placed on the left side sampled for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can’t take a player like that out completely.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own elf managed to make up for it: McGill's free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through to the long Toreck (45.).
After the change of sides, it was again McGill who achieved the balance (59.).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel again shocked Albachten (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann matched (69).
Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia (80th) match.
We must now focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against Schappedeten, that's what we have to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nubel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albert).
Football: TSV Straßberg wins points against Primus
There were no winners in the Landesliga duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The leader of the table had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0: 0.
Media: Entire Executive Board of Dynamo Dresden resigned
The entire board of Dynamo Dresden has resigned, according to media reports.
Several media outlets called for a joint letter from the Saxon panel in the evening.
At first there was no confirmation from the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides such relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many had thought he shouldn’t have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers around 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, his term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there as a guest.
For example, Academy Director Udo Hahn reckoned him when he said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That celebrities appear at the Academy in Tutzing Castle again and again, was also an issue during the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "tolerance prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in themselves.
“Retirement is not safe!” reads the title of the meeting.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - this is how the academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarism without limits".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death – war mocks every human idea.
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society to the rift between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitization.
Academy Director Hahn said: “A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions.”
At a meeting of the 200.
Karl Marx’s birthday is coming soon, some expect more visitors to the direction of capitalism-criticism, others rather a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What about neutrality?
“We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical State Church,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100 percent neutral.”
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabarette artist, Teubner worked on gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeled) woman and (feeled) man and whatever else there may be, but also with music.
She used the mini-guitar and mastered her violin as well.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
He is on the one hand the male sparring partner, who sometimes even comes to words until the end of the sentence, on the other hand a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanies Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely as it fits the evening’s red thread.
Then Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes, if he does have a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from Mozart’s composing if “the Nannerl” had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach’s “O Haupt full of blood and wounds” into the “Song of Death”, and from Mozart’s G minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, Treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the Chansonette.
But the chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thank you.
She had the idea to treat the duo to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as one in Wolbeck.

The controversial tech billionaire Elon Musk may remain CEO of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but must give up the chairmanship of the board of directors.
Musk also agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a double-digit million dollar penalty, the SEC said.
Background is Musk’s surprise August announcement to take Tesla off the stock market.
The SEC accused Musk in its lawsuit of making false and misleading statements.
- Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police slightly corrected the death toll.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of 15.
All of them have since been released from the hospital.
The French bus driver had stayed for one night in the hospital for observation.
He will be fired during the day, a police spokesman said.
The cause of the bus accident at Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed unbroken frontally against a guardrail on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlen women had problems especially with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
"Actually, I was very satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn’t manage them,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The focus in the finale made his team miss this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost until the end behind a backlog, lay at 11:12 for the break and later still at 15:18 (45.) behind.
It was only towards the end that the wider bench of the hostesses became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left, who then made "extremely clever the decisive goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. Liga Frauen: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the women volleyballers of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-league downhill VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
That’s what we’ve come up with now,” coach Dominik Münch said after an almost impeccable performance by his team at the downed leader.
The first passage was dominated by the guests almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-master of the previous year.
Food accepted in the double bar, but did not come into play.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has beaten with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second set, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Eat has switched the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food sucked up, and we got a little sucked in," Münch continued.
At 18:17 the volleyball women from the Ruhr area had their nose in front for the first time.
Although Ostbevern defeated four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the exercise leader to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge made a significant contribution to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and calmly."
Above 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-Whites brought four with 25:22 to their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a heap of shards in the German-Turkish relationship, which can only be met with difficulty," said TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
“Instead of emphasizing the affiliation of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes,” Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has “intensified many reservations”.
Home club Nottuln: offer has already established
After the long summer break, it’s finally time for folkreff.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7.30 pm, the Heimatverein Nottuln is already holding its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day, it was a year ago that we conducted a folk reunion for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk reunion would bleed so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Whether it was a storm-deep Friederike in January or a heat wave in July, the office’s fireplace room was always full.
"As always, the program at the next Folkreff is a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who repeatedly invites musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has promised his accordion for the first folkreff "birthday".
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, which played music with platt-German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The makers of the Folkreff are happy to remember the last event of the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Folkreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frosche in der Nacht" delighted the listeners and sent home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a sociable and humorous evening once again," the invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always filled quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk reunion starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7.00 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world’s largest industrial gas company.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
This means that the multi-billion-dollar merger is still subject to permits in South Korea and – as the biggest hurdle – in the United States.
Recently, the chances of approval had improved there, according to an insider, because Linde promised to sell additional company parts.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24 in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the district association for horticulture and state maintenance was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus set the final foundation impulses for the district association for horticulture and state care Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, it was called differently at the time: As a "district fruit-building association Kulmbach city and country" it was raised from the baptism by mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually about the fruit-growing, about flowers and horticulture nobody thought about at the time.
"At that time, in the Enlightenment era, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Günter Dippold, district home caretaker in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens have been created at schools.
The cultivation of fruit is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is by no means exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mauswürfe" showed how versatile the tasks of a gardening association are on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the district chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a similar amount of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should stand, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner and stressed the special importance of horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the county, also the district manager and expert consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt.
He guided the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a picture lecture and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was endoste.
By the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden had turned into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has endured, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," argued the expert for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is the incentive for the horticultural associations not to give up, so that our home remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the president of the Bavarian state association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif, who was solemnly framed by the turret glasses of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on NAFTA talks: Canada’s foreign minister moves UN address
Mexico’s government wants clarity on NAFTA: they are putting an ultimatum for an agreement on both sides.
Canada’s foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority – and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure in the struggle for a re-issue of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations General Assembly, spokesperson Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she is focusing on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August to recast the NAFTA regional free trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be concluded, the Trump administration wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential Candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily O Globo.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential election.
The politician had been attacked in early September during an election campaign event in southern Brazil on the open road.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaro made racist and women-despising statements mobile.
Several thousand protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mingled with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the million-dollar city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, Haddad was so far far far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in political activity for a long time, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates wins an absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a by-election on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this - no matter who he is running against.
Bolsonaro is known for his campaigning against gays and blacks and for his glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he is shocked by verbal derailments.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula’s left-wing workers’ party should be shot.

Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen's website.
At his deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and The Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who "was against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at compressed air hammer level
"Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a retelling of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: Hardrock pure of three bands with one other friend.
After the sound check and just before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands, the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are visibly enthralled.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is able to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to a harmonious and powerful interplay.
Although "addition" calls are not to be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then left the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that hardrock is not the same hardrock with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock from the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" a synthesizer is also used in "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnisheuschen has, however, gained a special degree of fame since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has a special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unmistakable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in conjunction with the band, also sets its own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to a genre-related hard rock concert of course: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing desk team, the three-piece concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of compressed air hammers, but is thus still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval", to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience does not need 120 decibels in jet-drive volume as usual with the annual metal stall dichein in the north of the Republic.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we took the bone saw and set off a concert evening with the power of a tiger," all three groups, of course in a figurative sense, can say at the end.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A death in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
In a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport, a glider crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a glider crashed at the exhibition parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the flight student was on board alone - the plane is supposed to be a single-seater.
The plane had already landed at the time of the accident.
The crash site is located just a short distance from a party tent on the airport grounds.
An October Festival has been taking place since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr area cities and directly at the driveway to motorway 52.
From the car park there is a Park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump: "And then we fell in love"
That North Korean President Kim is well-meaning despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a veritable declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has announced a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old offshoot of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, despite the fact that it proves to be quite tough in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he was too, and between us it was going back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay. - Okay.
No, I'm not.
And it wasn’t just the conversations with Kim that had caused his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump pointed to Kim’s announced stoppage of all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip service.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - according to Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be for everyone, seemed to be quite aware of the US president.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidential.
Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd, “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crowded arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, atmospherically and also spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler's downtown cleaned up on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the festive tent at the fire tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to point out their disastrous detention conditions in Libya, enabling their rescue.
The group had filmed the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July at risk of life and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," one man said in the video message.
We are suffering here, we are dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean into Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger, according to his own statement.
One of his comrades was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homes this year through the program, said IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not unusual in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a phone call for help so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya’s refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely dominated by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At about 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building across the main entrance.
In the entrance of the first floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the front place.
The teacher contacted the police, who initiated the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen cannot yet be said.
16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

German was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old man has had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in central Franconia after he had stuck the car off all forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescuers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported missing by his family after he did not return on Tuesday from a trip with his SUV over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man’s whereabouts had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, urged the rule of law in Turkey.
Relations between the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns mainly arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
He said: “If relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, then the rule of law is a very important prerequisite.”
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved shortly to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally it was supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the owners of the castle had rejected it out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to travel after the conversation to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of stressing the successes of North Korea’s denuclearization negotiations, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a response from Washington.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government at the UN General Debate of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The latest standstill comes as the U.S. builds on coercive measures that are lethal to building trust,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can disarm ourselves first," he said.
That sanctions could “force North Korea on its knees” is “a wishful thinking of people who don’t know us.”
To build trust, however, his country had stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there were no “corresponding reactions” from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone last year decided three times sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working towards a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang for talks on ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT served: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the House of the Open Door HoT got nothing with: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: A power failure had put the huge two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was spoilt and had to be disposed of.
“We had to start over again: we had a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to make it on their own,” Westbuer said.
And so everyone got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were delighted.
“Cooks can’t do better either,” praised a visitor impressed, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen made surprises with card tricks and other artifacts.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW regional board of boards
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as deputy head of the NRW panels, Sartor told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many fell in my back.
The head of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa his understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor with it.
"I can understand his step - there were people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Tafel does it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
Sartor in the "Welt am Sonntag" again criticized criticism of colleagues from other tables.
We should not follow the approach, “without us, the people in the city are starving.”
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essener did not take part in a conference of the panels on Friday in Berlin.
"I'm being told too much sweet stuff," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that criticized me that way back then.
SF Lorch lose 2-0 lead - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, Bezirksliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after backlog - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports fans was great.

Gladbach play twice lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lose a lead twice.
Schalke comes to the first win of the season against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Schalke has maneuvered offside four times in the first five league games with early opponents.
Now Domenico Tedesco’s team put back the strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work by Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, subsequently the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded against Bayer Leverkusen a 0: 2-back until the break, but came to the 4-2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) matched a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, provided another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also won the first race.
Against the decimated Werder Bremen already before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to frighten in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in owner who helped the guests balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who competed with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, took the lead twice, ultimately played 2:2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was in charge of Wolfsburg’s 1:1 matchup with his second Bundesliga player.
At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargau, Yann Sommer was powerless, as well as at the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase came from OGC Nice for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven laps, Gladbach took 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against VfB Stuttgart into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter, which the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first season hit, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to his team: The 23-year-old Serbian cashed after a jersey swipe against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart's defenders Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremens back into the game through a curious throw-in owner (68th), a quarter-hour before the end Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters acting in excess back to the Siegesstrasse.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3-0 for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens put the home team on track by means of foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
Around 1.8 million Macedonians are now voting on whether to change their country’s name to North Macedonia.
If yes, the nearly three-decade-old conflict with neighbouring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the west.
Voters therefore also decide on the future integration of the West.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in a positive outcome of the referendum.
Sirens in U-Detention.
The refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three female pensioners and wounded them partly severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had rioted at around 10 p.m. on Friday in the Fluchtgasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they instructed the accused, who started with clenched fists on passers-by and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
The Syrians then tried to beat and kick the officers.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground at a tram stop in Währinger Straße.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered bruises, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured "for an unknown cause", as the police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership was not considered for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
"If we get married, that's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a stir on June 30, 2017.
He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having “stolped” herself on the subject.
"That was your moment in Schabowski," he said, referring to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the citizens’ association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprosy.
Because around 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Walter Schröer, chairman of the citizens’ association.
And so many things have accumulated.
Due to the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a shape cut.
Because already in the spring the hedge has already been shaved.
The breakfast always following to work also has a long tradition.
“We want everyone to stay strong,” said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Cup
Hannes Aigner of Augsburg won the gold medal at the conclusion of the World Canoe Slalom Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the course and it was all right today," said the Olympic third in London in 2012.
In the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and stretched both arms up safely in victory, knowing that it would suffice for at least one medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
But the six remaining starters could not top his fabled time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pavel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspectorate reports the first burglary attempt this fall in a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what burglars want to use again.
The Gauting police inspectorate announced yesterday the first attempted burglary this autumn.
The fact that it remained during the test at the detached house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them to such an extent that they fled without prey.

Bankruptcy at Hertha: Reached by reality: Bayern against Ajax demanded
The unbeatable predicate is gone: The defeat in Berlin does not want FC Bayern to "let itself be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim face-off for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance peak under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to the greater autumn low for the Munichers.
“One week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we’ve got a little bit of reality,” said Thomas Müller after the deserved 0:2 loss at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that is why we are heading for Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year no goal has been scored, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in series without victory, the leader in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at the 1:1 with its whimsical man-on-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last overpowering Bayern must be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to make it happen again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he dealt with his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the once again deficient handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim episode of his term of office look positive - otherwise the tone is likely to worsen.
For example, Kovac did not take any extraordinary action before the second King Class appearance of this season after the 2-0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round against Ajax begins as planned, which had also defeated AEK Athens with 3-0 at the start.
"Now we got it in two games, but we will also be making our goals again," said national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, especially Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The right-wing defender appeared in the role as a reminder.
"I don't think this is all bad luck, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old said just before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season, Bayern were behind Dortmund with five points, which has now taken the lead again with a point advantage.
And so Kimmich rated at least positively, with a wink, that now the public debate over the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It’s good for the league.
DFB boss in line of fire: Ozil cause: sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the ongoing dispute theme of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On early Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the Cause in the ZDF "sports studio" in Mainz.
"In the future, because we also have many players with a migrant background in the U-teams, we have to draw very precise conclusions that this does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migrant background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said Saturday in the cathedral city.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, have been excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which had begun with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to appear in front of players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m immigrant – that’s not possible.
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for Ozil's return to the national team.
In addition to the Brazilian-born Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration commissioner will be appointed.
"If there is one without a migration background that has a clear impact on society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for president again next year.
“I’m doing my job and trying to do it as well as I can,” Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police reported, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 1pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the Lauterer Höhe area.
She told the retiree that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange because the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had walked off the road and drove against a control post.
The man did not want the police on site and then drove away.
Afterwards, the runner went home.
However, the retiree walked in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle while turning.
Eventually, the police could find him and stop him.
His car was clearly damaged in an accident.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could not remember much.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1000 operational forces are still in operation.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the bog fire on a Bundeswehr site in the Emsland, 980 emergency personnel are still engaged in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of armed forces is planned, it said.
In the night to Sunday, an above-ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the catastrophe had been lifted, which was declared a week earlier on September 21, because it had been feared that the flames would endanger adjacent forests and settlements by wind and spark flight.
On Thursday, it was said that a spread of the fire to neighboring communities no longer threatens.
At times, more than 1,500 field forces were trying to get the big fire under control.
The Luftwaffe further supports the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for October 2 and 5.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand was sometimes pulled up to a hundred kilometers far over the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that accepts reports of damage.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Almost exactly a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them said yes to each other in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered partnership was not considered for her, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
If we get married, that's right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused a stir on June 30, 2017.
He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having “stolped” herself on the subject.
"That was your moment in Schabowski," he said, referring to Günter Schabowski's accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption law.
Macedonian referendum on new name of state started
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its eponymous northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of pressure, for almost three decades Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the kick-off for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel, The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in 2016 in the United States, leaving behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swisstransplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor ID card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card is found at the decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
“They then have to make a deputy decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome,” says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
“A register in which people can register their wishes – for or against organ donation – does not exist,” she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor unless he or her relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head counting.
He prevailed in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 comrades.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Chief Referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans competing.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries attempted to qualify for the competition.
Greet was already two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms like Superbrain, Genie or Wonder Child, organizers can start Laue little.
“Head counting can be trained,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even stadium-oriented computer competitions.
The disciplines include, for example, square rooting from six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates are given surprise tasks, for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also had good chances, said the chief referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because there, even in early childhood, head counting is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Nude Serena Williams: It's About Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams demonstrates her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover their most intimate places.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett has died of this.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which is about breast cancer early detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT scan, blood clots were discovered in Serena's lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill on the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle is shaking her beds in the West for the first time next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions therefore become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start annual kink care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start annual kink care on Monday.
The "green walls" unique in Germany have been shaping the landscape of the low-forest federal state for about 200 years.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five meters wide are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The knicks were created on the basis of an order of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only a field boundary and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
Its name "Knick" also comes from that time: by "bending" the branches, the dense, interwoven delimitations could develop.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45,000 kilometers of hedges extend and give the image of a wood-rich, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the kink can only fulfil its ecologically important function if it is cared for accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, it becomes a light row of trees, which, in addition to the biodiversity, also loses the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, kink care may only be carried out outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about situation on the ground
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you on the scene during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people sometimes steal food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the inmates are partly free to walk around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision going on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but before that did not work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, who they don’t know if they live and where they are, because people weren’t at home during the earthquakes, but on the road at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for it, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have rushed to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Ring of Fire not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing from VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
Aogo had a muscle fiber tear in the back left thigh at the 2-1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the football league player announced on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle tear in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following national break.
VfB Stuttgart did not make a forecast on downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals slightly faster.
Triumph of hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the Film Festival of San Sebastián, the annual closing ceremony of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the songs on the cinema, it can be summarized: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice that was able to attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the fire brigade Olching tried to capture an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching - Walkers on Lake Olching spotted a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the water watch station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to catch the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to evade the emergency forces over and over again.
In the end, she fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to circle the animal and push it back ashore, where it was then, after almost an hour, put into a transport box by a firefighter with a hearty handle.
The duck injured in the chest was then taken to the LMU animal clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to initial estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins World Cup medal
Fourth at the Olympics, biathlete Julian Eberhard was in his stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to catch up with the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic sprint of Pyeongchang the close-to-grip medal.
In the end, seven tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
"I consciously took the time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up with the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
At some point, you have to hit.
The World Cup track in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after Olympia he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the past World Cup winter in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN).
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) to second place.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation at Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation in Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the tiny majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh on charges of coercion.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama around Kavanaugh’s vocation, which was accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in the course of which the lawyer lashed out angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the arch-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared contrary to his original announcement that he would agree but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday called the heavy accusations a "shock," initially abstained from further attacks on the women, speaking on the contrary of "happiness in misfortune."
That way, the last doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of investigators.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are expected to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device of the municipality of Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle", for monitoring the speed limit, will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The city also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
However, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
That was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said the sporting director of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the Königsblauen still managed to bring the narrow 1-0 against the Rheinhessen over time and thus the first win of the season under the roof and compartment.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11 had given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco certainty: "In sum, the first half was good, both playfully and from the pressing", obviously more and more the head played a role with the duration of the game.
Not really a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it away and therefore retreated further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counts of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from our hearts," said Schöpf, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball goal: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with a lot of pressure in the initial phase and make it a fireworks show," Schalke's head coach said.
Victory was important.
We can finally look forward to a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Königsblau missed it, rather to worry about clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it wouldn’t have been a quake victory,” Tedesco said: “You’ve already felt the fear a little bit.”
So I'm glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitachtal Valley observed a fire on Sunday at around 1.30 p.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and fire departments soon found out the cause: An unknown person had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it looked as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the heat unattended.
This is near the forest.
Thirty Fischbachau firefighters were involved in dismantling and erasing.
Police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"For many years, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Cultural Policy" in the organization of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a comprehensible way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and the one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, first-generation migrants at the cat table.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether to classify politically to the right or to the left, but rather: “Am I for or against an open society?” he stresses.
At first rather behave, then the discussion round starts more and more vigorously.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on stage, as a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the issue, because "only when we understand what the problem is, can we find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing session, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and was also discussed intensively in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win kick-off games
The Giessen 46ers and Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and away win.
Gießen prevailed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the middle German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
At the beginning of the new season, the German champion Bayern Munich and the former series champion Brose Bamberg had considerably more trouble.
Munich already struggled on Friday to an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg on Saturday won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 prospects have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the newly built area of Landsham-Süd on the open market.
That’s what Mayor Roland Frick said.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots, which the municipality offers at more favorable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model, has been completed.
More than 100 applications were received, according to Frick.
"Currently the documents are being checked", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Pliening, the goal is to have the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and present them to the municipal council.
Then the award can be made.
In total, 50 plots of land for single and double houses will be created on the area in the south of Landsham, as well as four plots for multi-family houses with eight residential units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be paved soon.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private individual, the rest of the municipality Pliening.
It sells the majority on the open market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free state-funded, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people
Coarsely estimated on the area of the new construction area Landsham-Süd housing is created for about 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a day care center.
It will house three kindergarten and three crèche groups as well as a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "great sport" also on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the starting eleven: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not sat in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding among many people would have been great if the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian had really talked about the frustration of his soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and thanked Domenico Tedesco to all his pros, the 36-year-old, who is all called Naldo for simplicity, came in and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said of the reaction his deputy captain, who, despite his reservist existence, had no resentment whatsoever.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he did not actually get on the rack with his coach - but for good reason gets a break.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn’t easy to tell him.
“It wasn’t easy to tell him that, I’m telling you quite honestly,” Tedesco said of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn’t in the starting eleven.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco said.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto for 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It’s important that everyone is able to sniff out at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," explained Tedesco the rotation, which recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued in August to accelerate its decline compared to the eurozone.
The Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
Europe-wide, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute said on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the mark of 50 points for the 13th month in a row, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry cracked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final result was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, although slower than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"While the slightly slowed down could mean that the worst has been overcome," Markit economist Rob Dobson said.
However, in the third quarter, industry remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone fell as strong as they have not been since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Also in China, industrial production fell more strongly in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
This includes developments in sales, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchel's PSG team wins eighth in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel hastens from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France’s football championship.
At the OGC Nice the defending champion won thanks to two goals of superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
Most recently, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and set the final in the follow-up time.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) took over the 2-0.
With this, Paris also managed the general rehearsal for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the Royal Class, Tuchels team had to endure the only compulsory game defeat so far this season at the 2:3 in Liverpool.
