The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor do they know the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has once "knocked off" members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as it has mastered the notorious slang that has become naturalized in recent years, in which the current coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils tapped somewhat in the dark in terms of these new terms.
At least they say so.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"I don't know."
"I'm more of a newcomer in Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "parent word treasure".
But also Councillor Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golloch".
"That's the only expression of those you present to me here that I use from time to time."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in June this year before the ODS Electoral Congress, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague Gulf Hole", "go to the confectionery", "Stiernacken", "Treason of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first to participate in the conversation, but then did not even decline the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things and how the Democrat talks to each other, I don’t judge that.”
“It’s important to me how we understand ourselves in our programs,” he countered.
As already indicated, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not recognize in the headline mentioned above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly came up with in the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"That's the tunnel blank," Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> says, adding, "but I'm more likely to know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfhole" is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> correctly as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant," Plach<0xC3><0xBD> is pretty close to solving the mystery, knowing that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
In agreement with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, however, he contends that he drew this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there does not appear to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there isn’t such a thing with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> - called "Hulda" by his party associates salopp.
"In school, I was called B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tried the name and there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by machinations in the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only one that the Social Democrats allow in the intrapartisan language.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly does not like to be called "Hulda", but Den<0xC3><0xAD>k Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Stick Rights" allegedly has to do with Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> acquiring his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they do not find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
When one of these women "becomes" a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are rarely affected by this fate.”
“Even young and healthy women are spared this because they help to work and give birth to children,” a nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, where more than one hundred women were cared for by their communities in a special home.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he issued a brochure to prevent "witch persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "derStandard" pointed out to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men – they poured petroleum over her and simply set her on fire.
The incident was reported by the BBC server.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
After the group tried to "eject an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports the people here regardless of their education.
“The Standard” quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Freshers of human souls are a danger before as they are today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president himself has mixed up last year.
“President Yahya Jammeh ignited a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt’s death, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic.”
“To this end, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President’s bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink an absud of plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly one thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He does heat in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a portfolio with three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
For all three, the rent has been increased under the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rent, the son is to pay 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven," he annoyed with his finger on the son's new lease, for which he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-wrong and half-resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it intends to publish a guide on how to act against such contracts.
But the man just waved.
“One says this, the other says that,” he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-oriented rent.
Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full at nine in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller device.
"Rente 2011", so a special touch field on the touchscreen lights up.
Shortly taped and already the device spits out a digit number.
Hardly have we deciphered the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply at all to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November onwards, the envelopes in the Ostrava region with the new leases will be flattering in the mailboxes for most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action is running a little over a week, that is, this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ apartments are a fierce issue.
Before the elections, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s deputy parliamentary president Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaorálek from Ostrava had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They could not even replace toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning breathes.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the counter to see if they really get the promised rent reduction, which RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease by December 15, will also benefit from a half-reduced February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"Of the 360 clients yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were due to here," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements both on its websites and on wall panels, where it appears necessary.
However, if the lease parties do not agree on the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG said on its website.
“No one is going to court here,” says one of the RPG Byty employees and a man on the street in front of the client center.
“I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute,” he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she said.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the concerned tenants is in the opinion of the homeowners the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest $4 billion from the rents made in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years between 2011 and 2014, it is expected to be $5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, a few red glowing information appear again and again in the meantime.
"The rent increases in 2011 of 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," reads on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will increase rent by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it’s about increasing extremely low rental prices by 19.66 CZK per square meter,” RPG argues.
At 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not jump up rents, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenues from the rent increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw a - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-play area on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which a whole series of well-known Brno buildings come, reckoned from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company kindergarten.
In a wise light, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company is committed to ensuring that the architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the ability to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers and architects find it easier to bring their demanding profession and child care under one roof.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies amounting to CZK 2.8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years qualified personnel and for the operation are provided.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took an entire year, with the company providing an active economy rating for the processing of applications.
The children take care of fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day alternates over several children.
The kindergarten company is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the content of the program in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of preschool education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool classes, by the way they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, eliminating the stress of late picking up the children from a far-away kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer-employee relationships.
Arch.Design ranks among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in hiring new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs boost their human resources marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are ripped fish columns.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the scale-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s Art Nouveau style.
The fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures, reminiscent of nature and living beings.
Only with a closer look can you see that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
At night, the entire fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination reinforces the shine of the colors.
The same vivid lines and convoluted shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even look holes and strips.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló rental house did not design Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other sculptors and artists also collaborated on the design of the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Casa Milá house in Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "bone house".
Others in turn called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "grooming house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed for the house a central heating system with vents and typical fireplaces unique for the time.
Something bizarre about her 45-degree inclination.
In his work, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be fooled by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified at the result two years later when it was completed that they demanded relief.
Among other things, the councillors met with the fact that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district, Josep Batlló made a request to approve the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house received a rather unusual roof and two other floors due to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles, with which the courtyard and the courtyards are covered, is also impressive.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which absorb sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners only decided in the year to this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was determined that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, and they were also extended to other common rooms and the attic, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist cards receive 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friends with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed grate? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting channels in the core and also lie on a solid plate, moisture builds up: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“All the ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep here properly anymore.”
"For their skinned shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
“I recommend these, among other things, to sugar-sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the “information” from the joints and the skin poorly,” explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I bought these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) for many ice hockey players years ago, but also for other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it really clings to the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you do not roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (burn).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
For the sake of comfort and also for eventual visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies for the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should be enough room for the slightly bent arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and room decorators, who has been devoting herself to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture school for years and also focuses on this subject.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is no other option than to mount the grate at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be on the mold layer and the fine cushion.
"With your hand or when sitting down, you must not feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Upholstered beds with mattress and mattress, such as siamese twins, have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress will slowly become a huge (and clogged) sieve after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years for mattresses, even a lifetime guarantee.
Every thing has its if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, however, it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with a round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often looks like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if they are not already inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable lattice bars with 14 to 18 spring strips (lamellae), always with a larger number of lattice bars, i.e. of 28 and more spring strips, with lattice support in the lumbar region and the possibility of regulating the hardness of the lattice.
Mattresses with a spring skeleton do not belong to adjustable lamellar grids, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press in the spring strips or even to bend them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink punctually.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "man's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are granted these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grate with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a pillow of 50 x 60 cm will appear, as the Scandinavians like, for example.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the grate or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is "organic".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor and soybean oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"In mattresses, organic is their core made of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also indulge in microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Again, there is a difference between a man and a woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves to allow the mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, the covers have a "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasantly warm during sleep.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
By combining the various stiffnesses (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to pay 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT since they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to achieve this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
From time to time, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with covered Visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it solidifies in turn.
In this way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and More Parents Want Human Surveillance Devices to Keep Kids Under Control
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them by GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful even in such cases, as recently when the nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková disappeared without a trace.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it should not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka in fear and terror, so they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there can be abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we have not had such a case before."
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what the purpose of the "box" is and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Mobile phones have already raised high expectations among parents at the beginning, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“When kidnappings are planned, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics with which to locate it.”
“Today it’s the cell phone.”
“If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position," says Mr. <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install a special software.
The problem with current locators is that they are either matchbox-sized devices that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are therefore being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he realizes that after a certain time, which gives the police a lead in time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development is going - towards bracelets or trailers, always the same technology is used as in the vehicle location.
So to the combination of locating function using the GPS system (just like with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic but only hold it for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, with explosives to be detonated.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the shelf life of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the STV Group stock company, a. s. for 40 million kroner.
In its justification for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60-kilometre ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES responded to this, it appears from this statement that the whole army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretary and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
This is the only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would suffice for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for training each new professional soldier two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a calming stock for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased demand of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the rapid-deployment brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted because of the lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
“I also don’t understand why they buy such huge quantities of ignition cords from us.”
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to meet as much as possible," says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, sales manager of the STV Group.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cord with the idea that the army would have covered itself with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of the STV Group speaks of only a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians even of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed as a soldier, so as not to be accused of criticism of the army.
After the period of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 km ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of ignition cords from police pyrotechnicians, who liquidate munitions from World War II or the Soviet Brotherhood army, has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only those quantities of this ammunition, which they can consume even before the end of the service life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, it also keeps the possibility of flexible purchases more modern and therefore also reliable ignition cords open.
The Ministry of Defence has already had huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnicians, MF DNES is expecting the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which it has so "cheaply" bought today.
I still have the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition.
The winning placement in the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" has helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that there was a lack of good accommodation in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan he acquired a broken house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio then annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four pensions, two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one of last year.
"A large share of this hotel-operating license sale has just won the Entrepreneur of the Year competition," adds Mr. Pytloun, acknowledgingly.
The victory has earned him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say that did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to make something to take part in this competition.
You don't have to win right away either, every visualization is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have happened at all.
“With some of the people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships today.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also reflects a bit on each of his employees.
And there he is in the seventies.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them because they are part of something that is universally recognized.”
I really don’t see this as just a personal success, no, it’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore a little," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Last year, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, the company owner of Farmet, accepted the prize for first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts with which he stamped out a company from the small toolmaking in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was the effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD> a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, but left his career in the company in which he had been employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few of his father's comrades.
Shortly thereafter, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
"Not only did our customers notice the Farmet brand much more intensely, our foreign partners also began to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, giving greater value," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year at Farmet, however, was not only a sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation either.”
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation under control and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to give up - in investing in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A poll that cleans up nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already managed to get rid of the world.
The dubious winner of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" was the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite 4,000 voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper excerpt from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing now.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register in the future when it comes to checks on social security payers," said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is already the fourth time this year that it is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public eye.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to obstruct corporate activity.
"In terms of, for example, the number of income tax forms, we are at the forefront of the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businessmen of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, down eight places from the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was declared for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to register. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Anti Prize" and allows the public to vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It is the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders have already been registered.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The opening of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of a happening that regularly includes political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were at the culmination of the competition.
“Wherever the state throws the entrepreneurs a stick between their legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily hinder entrepreneurs’ undertakings,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to create nonsensical arrangements from the world are effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the obligation imposed on the entrepreneurs to report to the commercial office at the location of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or church.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of a amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Employment Office official travel of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And -- all good things are three:
In 2009, the ordinance imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the office.
This regulation has been somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation has dropped.
A new category honours socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We would like to support companies that are aware of the impact of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
For this year’s first year of this special sub-category of the main Vodafon Company of the Year competition, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for a standalone article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the object of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, it is about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague-based software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady also takes good care of its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible company of the region of Central Bohemia"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the year, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their area and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the impact of our business and administration on the environment,” explains Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová, managing director.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem region, in turn, cares about the health of its employees and therefore has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, in addition to promoting homework for its employees and for company actions, it uses cartering services offered by a domestic protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD>" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance, is also worth mentioning.
"We provide our employees with contributions for food, for work, to increase their qualifications and for holidays," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Slesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year, all the district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer no later than 15 August.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the 'Responsible Company of the Year' competition, but in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition they were not disqualified."
"Separate registration is not possible for this competition only, as it is only a sub-category of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests at public tender
In the ground fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
He had allegedly attempted to manipulate a current public competition to settle claims for restitution in such a way that the plots offered in the competition fell to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million for it.
"At this point in time, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the crime of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", which could not give any further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was fired by the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, can only be speculated about in the face of the scarce official information.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC4><0x8C>erná, spokeswoman for the soil fund, pointed out that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsen subdivision of the soil fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to Ms <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public competition had been correctly labelled as ‘call to tender claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act’ and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the offered land.
"These persons offer, within the scope of the solicitation, a higher value of their claims for restitution to be paid by the transfer than the value of the land claimed."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," the fund's spokeswoman explains.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. obviously had information available on who had signed up at the request and, as he was himself a entitled person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to a land interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat payoff.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the soil fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement restitutions, to which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. also purchased land from the Bodenfonds, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the site where the construction of the access magistral to the commercial area Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At the time, the town hall had to give small contributions with a heavy heart, in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred per month
Households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy from January onwards, but also higher water and sewage charges and for district heating, and rents will also increase in some places.
From January onwards, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more out of their wallets each month than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also cost district heating supplies.
Households alone cost several hundred kroner more per year.
Power prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, which is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred more crowns are to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Especially larger places are planning price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor per month for district heating from January, and families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1,000 kronor per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, are threatened with 9% higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation is eliminated from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to sue you in court.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in almost 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally sometimes a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen have to be most often treated emergency.
No exception are children who have to repeatedly sleep their cat in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department at the Central Bohemian Hospital Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice.
"Whisky, if it manages to steal a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it does not smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
Motol Eva Jurinová, spokeswoman for the Faculty Hospital, is right.
“It’s mostly about Fernet or rum.”
"This is the alcohol trend today, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," Ms. Jurinová said.
According to chief doctor Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admission are no exception.
Before the hospital in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
“Her career began at the age of 12, when she was first introduced to the blood with 3.5 perm of alcohol and in combination with ecstasy,” the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing was that it didn’t seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” the chief doctor wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when starting with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
Real dependence in the true sense of the word, according to experts, is not about children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Ms Jurinová, by mid-November about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunken children brought home by their parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, there are, in the opinion of Mr Pelikán, three seasonal amplitudes on which one hundred percent can rely: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
“The latter was for two reasons – either out of grief over the bad testimony or out of joy on vacation.”
"On Walpurgis night, I have also seen seven drunken children at once in the recording," emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning after, which are caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose, can be eliminated in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood, without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood at least by telling them the cost they will cost the treatment.
Because transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly for a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Once and again I used this as a means of education, when I directly calculated the children during the visit, what cost their drunkenness and that it may well happen that they have to work the whole vacation to earn the money for a single such party," Dr Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two L-159 light fighter jets out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that a machine of this type has been in the possession of a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen abroad at manoeuvres or flight shows.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech Army.
The other three aircraft are L-159 single-seaters.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over last week.
Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, has not yet been told when she is physically dispatching the planes from Vodochody.
The L-159 single-seat warplanes, in turn, were separated from long-term stored aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry’s department.
"The double-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current state and appearance," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seat fighter jets, as the Department of Defense signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four superfluous L-159s to a two-seat version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, and the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter jets into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to be used to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional planes for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for procurement, but instead addressed EADS directly.
The then Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest they wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa planes should also have a judicial afterthought.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tendering procedure and not by appealing to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to land at Kbely Airport in 14 days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men up to sixty," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health burdens, Ms Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was applied as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
In men whose index fingers were longer than the ring finger, however, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to 60 even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form as early as prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK was fleetingly aware of the study but did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter workers were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between km 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents by trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Car-Moto-Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
At kilometers 91, a truck crashed, at kilometers 93, two trucks collided, in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
Drivers should leave behind Brno at 190 kilometers or drive over Brno and climb at 182 kilometers to the village of K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
This is where mile-long traffic jams are formed.
There was also an accident on the D11, which happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Auto columns are formed, for example, in the Prosek town lane, also the street <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transportation is the metro.
Trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems on the railroad and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snow expulsions.
For example, there are problems on the route Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 am until 5 am.
Most roads in Southern Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Around Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, three side roads are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno, there are snow dispersions and in the vicinity of Blansko, you are forced to use snow-milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov.
There are still three completely closed roads: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snowmills to clear snow.
So far, it is not possible to estimate when they will be traversable again.
In the Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, caution should be exercised in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert spreading agents for nature conservation reasons, there is a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most in Northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimetres in places.
Up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell in the Moravian-Slesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon.”
U.S. troops have deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed so that they can explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the ditch.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous splinters of steel from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains a precise point of view, after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to depress.
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you press down, the gun charges up and shoots the projectile to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs to be relocated
The Fujitsu Group is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their jobs from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is moving its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the group should be accommodated there, which were so far distributed to the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: “With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of a major company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt business director Markus Frank (CDU) said that it had once again won a "global player".
That’s a “great location statement.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed of the intention early on by the management.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have altered the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property in Marienbad.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have given the rash.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house at City Hall Square used by Fujitsu to date and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" together with the other buildings at Marienbad Square were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both for the massive development of the areas previously used as parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then still affiliated with Siemens, took over the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based German Real Estate Opportunity Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold a year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Based in Tokyo, Fujitsu is the third-largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary moves to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped floor plan - the central association for the electrical and electronics industry has its headquarters, among others.
Amazon shuts down servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is in increasing trouble.
The internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
It may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depesches.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is supposed to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"WikiLeaks Replaced by Amazon Servers."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Free," the revelation activists told Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Earlier this week, Amazon banned WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic statements to be able to cope with the high access rates to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has halted WikiLeaks’ use of its servers after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to have taken this action earlier in the face of WikiLeaks’ previous release of classified information,” the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for banning the platform from using servers in other countries as well.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, monstrous and ruthless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," the unpartisan senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, the exact location is known Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was an exchange of views.
President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently made known espionage calls on diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and this country’s interests are far more important than its one website.”
The U.S. government is now thoroughly testing the protection of its databases.
The White House said the deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed as the Special Representative.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to have the ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information reviewed.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists should they be put at risk by the WikiLeaks publication.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if that becomes necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatine and from the gelataio.
The gelato, in German somewhat ancient ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice-creaming art.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooler with a spatula, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some in the midlife crisis dream of a new career, others just dare to the smooth ice of their vague yearnings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to pack something of her own after years in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelato Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano also does not forget the cream of the national and even southern superstructure during his training: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a cock on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately the lecturer is besieged with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one let one’s own desire for experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the Zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarbone flour.
Of course, ice cream can also be made without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse, and the customer bites on all the ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
“The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of flavored additives.”
“But you should just experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or the ice cream from the white basic mass, which with eggs turns to yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano lets them each produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also carried out on the fruit ice-creams.
More flavors, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste nuttier when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture really highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano produces a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers use it to measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computation easier.
Making ice cream doesn’t require as much physical effort as it used to be.
It is not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small breakdowns do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates gobble themselves up with fruit puree from top to bottom when he gets out of control of the oversized rod mixer.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in the Twilight
The European food authority Efsa is underwhelmed by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
The expert group Testbiotech now formulates this accusation, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying association for years.
This is paid for by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in the Efsa test regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa rules were word-for-word identical with Ilsi's position papers and thus deceived the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has complained of a collision of interests.
So be a high-ranking Efsa manager recently without conditions or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and have thus changed sides.
The Central German Broadcasting Corporation (MDR) had recently revealed personnel connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as the EU parliamentarians heard.
However, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
All reputable data, including those from industry, are to be relied upon as long as they are of high technical quality, a statement said.
The experts who work for Efsa are not expected to have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently being approved in animals without any feeding experiments and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn is doing in the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how do you find them?” he asks.
Angelika Hilbeck sees this as well.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this field, as in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would not usually be published.
“Industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to tear off a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shell limestone, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He whispered, “A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy.”
When he saw one, he smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The track of the Stuttgart Stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought all those that fell during the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden bunch that was once a guardhouse.
Insulted and threatened, he says, when it was in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the northern wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it were to happen, it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the on average 80 kilos of cubes, price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half are still in the woods, the rest are already sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They came from everywhere and dragged away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgarter Steine des Anstoßes have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into limits of herbal beds.
“Actually, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He climbs in his off-road vehicle, making a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied and dropped out of law, later in biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany he carts together his treasures.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he's swarming.
"My favorite stone."
It goes the way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
The squares once belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart Police Department, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be cut by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and ox carts, he becomes very awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal to shred such a thing.”
He didn’t become rich, he didn’t become rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone trader today, and stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual valuer.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There's a lot of hangover at the buffet.
16 students crowded around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they are to work together with VW developers to learn about the car of the future - and, incidentally, to get to know Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into close competition and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they come to the job market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue lists about the achievements of their students, they try to detect the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company promotes the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can meet students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not uncommon.
It’s new that students are being raped so offensively.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
Instead, they have to inflate themselves, especially with highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to participate, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
According to Dykta, the high potentials at the universities are getting bigger and bigger.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to pay off.
"To this day, we have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
“Some are close to graduation and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct buhling on the campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go on a classic game at trade fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“For example, at Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problems of young people.
Currently, 35 jobs are advertised on the company website.
“It’s very difficult to fill vacant positions.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your thesis."
Expensive promotions are not required by the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote for itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This is often not what a large company can offer," says HR Manager Stube.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute compiles an annual list of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Head of Human Resources Stübe hopes that the placement will also bring benefits to job seekers.
“I think applicants are looking especially at external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to become more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In industry jargon, internal employer branding is called employer branding within your own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.

Obama stops new oil drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has enacted the government in Washington -- and thus definitively repealing its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is expected to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Ahead of the misfortune that claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not been definitively clarified to this day.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is facing billions of claims.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to present its results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out another disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which had been discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now publicly warning that tighter regulation would significantly reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry,” according to a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO – even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what exactly will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like gas station: billions of liters of crude oil leaked have destroyed nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to image a boy wading to the chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil floats beneath the surface is not to be seen.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured out of a broken pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst-polluted regions in the world.
As you travel through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, whoever immerses his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude out of the ground like black liquorice sticks, sadly letting the palms that are occasionally found hang their wings.
Swarms of birds, as they are usual in wetlands, are in vain: As soon as the outboard is silent, spooky tranquility spreads in the former paradise smelling like a gas station.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari darkly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield fought for decades: more than 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe invaded here, here in the 1980s organized the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
The company is still barred from returning to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of Switzerland’s triple size with over 5,000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil drains into the water.
More than two billion litres have flowed into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil that plunged into the sea 21 years ago in the accident of the supertanker “Exxon Valdez” in front of Alaska – one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed.
While Shell’s sabotage and organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see damaging drillheads and leaky pipelines as the main culprits.
Shell is setting significantly lower security standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: The rate of defects in the cables alone is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop in the open air from a distance, mangrove figures emerge: they are splintered and oil-lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later, kerosene drips out at the end of the line and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel daily: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - around $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest petroleum state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price at almost 40 euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a vanishingly small part of the provisionally interim raw material is illegally refined: organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share in tankers and displace it on the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the population’s movements or the lax mode of production, activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the fishermen’s livelihoods so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or theft or illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell was so destroyed that only a withdrawal from the group could be called into question: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better.”
Michael is nervous.
"Highest time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
“The soldiers can come every minute.”
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but with a painful lubrication.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, who are mainly from the country, also want to benefit from the raw material.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 has a major safety issue.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure" during the investigation of an emergency landed machine.
Qantas is suing the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas Airbus in early November were apparently far more fortunate than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 machines during its investigation - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: With an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Rolls-Royce-manufactured engines in 20 A380-series aircraft are affected.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney that would allow him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident in early November.
During the fire of the engine, parts had detached and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil burn as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Overnight snow fell almost all over the country.
There is chaos on many streets, trains and flights fail.
In car accidents, at least three people were killed.
Winter freezes Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic snows on Thursday night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
To the north and east are some 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but the constantly rising snow was not finished.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
On the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal from the morning.
In Saxony, snow removals on motorways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the weather agency Meteomedia, the alarm level in Saxon Switzerland was violet – the highest level ever.
In some cases, 30 centimeters of new snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused decay.
There were several trucks and cars stuck during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to congested traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Center, several cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous operation.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many streets on Wednesday night.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a train crash at a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed her car at Aschaffenburg on smooth roads.
But the meteorologists have good news: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore swirl even in light gusts.
But the wind will fade.
Only the Baltic Sea is affected by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could make up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group is apparently looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, the Financial Times Germany writes, citing a spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not give reasons for the planned sale.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell property on our own and then rent it back,” he said.
With this, Germany’s largest credit institution will relinquish its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and then extensively rehabilitated them.
The energy conversion consumed around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, now renamed "Greentowers", at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn for dead pals
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand remembered the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident pit is still precarious.
About two weeks ago, a massive explosion occurred at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the disaster pit, but had found no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue personnel could descend for safety reasons.
After the second fierce detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the comrades.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, there were set up 29 tables with helmets and lamps and the names of the comrades.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags wafted half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial service.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are expelled, it will begin to cool down the hot temperatures inside the mine, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warriors!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces turns his opponents around in rows - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, just because our hero liked to use rabid methods of killing, when his enemies were already vivid, he loaded the bad mouths.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says no word about the whole film, and even the other characters can be enticed at most once to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries.
Otherwise, it will be quiet and revel in the creepy hills of Scotland, which the Viking world of about a thousand years ago offers the backdrop.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It’s nice if a movie has multiple audiences, it’s only bad if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded since his wild and stylized drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the brain mass splashing around and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when one-eye for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries embarks via ship to Jerusalem and imprisons an eternity in flutter and fog before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a movie rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is especially a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-thirsty fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a stringent plot, it’s all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
There is no escape for the spectator.
With his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, he slowly cords up his throat, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands by his side faithfully preserves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporary allies, at some point becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows controls.
Around midnight from September 5th to 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets are attacking a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the quadrant with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that drains from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA made a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Using computer animation, she was able to see where the components of the pre-destruction reactor were, which is a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from close up or even the interior.
The reactor was shortly before commissioning, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, little more is known than then, yes the mysteries have become rather larger with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that while the CIA was quite sure that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, it saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor”, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be “plausible”.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is of having a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat responded in the summer only briefly that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians quickly set aside and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers directly after the attack via a member state, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always asserted that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA dismissed this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it prevents the controllers from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and from accessing the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, said in a statement.
For example, the investigation of the case since June 2008 has dragged on unsuccessfully and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in the room over which the IAEA is watching.
The IAEA appears to see three other facilities as key to progress in the enlightenment, which are supposed to be “in functional liaison” with the alleged reactor – and, unlike this one, still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed what equipment it is, what function it has or what makes it appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. (Isis) has identified these locations and found on satellite images a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely on this ground, Syria denies the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three sites and the quadrangle on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from, there are at best plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces was stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the rubble was.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from orbit show that Syria was conducting groundwork at the three suspected locations and removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomats say the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
Damascus, however, also ironed out this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna had reassured a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, therefore the matter is not very urgent, for example US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting into play so-called special inspections for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Energy Agency has to enforce controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from expecting an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat puts it: "What if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there have been troubles.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it, but that’s enough for trouble.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested, after which some scheduled shooting days in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women's War Victims' Organization wrote to Jolie about the UNHCR refugee agency and called for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be sacked as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her script to read, has given Sarajevo a shooting permit after a while - it's not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself contends that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked with great effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis about the film runs on the net, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different than the variant "Victims of rape gets caught up in torture servant".
That Jolie’s film actually begins before the war – that’s for sure.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the script, as so many have done before, illegally on the net.
Nothing like away from here
This evening, it’s finally going really well for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheer with joy at cracking loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Ireland trembles as players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, winning 500 euros plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play in Las Vegas, he will hold interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I don’t have a job there yet.”
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a ruck, pulling her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: as with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country in the near future, say experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they expect to have 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing that brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly troubling for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has so far only gone uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
Three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are out of work.
In the Irish Times there are also reader letters from young emigrants complaining: "Everything goes down the drain in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation.”
"The last one, please turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future emerging because the government is just eye-wiping and offers young people no prospects for the future.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She watches her classmates hanging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to put the issue on a positive footing.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galleoning service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O'Donovan has known how it feels to build somewhere else for half a year.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are currently building a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's homeland is now rarely seen, because he is doing extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says as he steps over the threshold for the first time after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m almost never more.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent credit financed.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan pondered for a while, pouring hot tea, and said, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation that he often hears at the moment.
“No one has to starve – our situation is far from as dramatic as it was in earlier times here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen – maybe that makes us feel like we’re Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and let’s just see how it goes with life elsewhere.
He’s been working in London for a few years and why shouldn’t New Zealand be good for him and his girlfriend?
But one thing still worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could expire in a farewell party.
“Just don’t get too many emotions,” he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a walk-away party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."

Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometer survey was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly relevant in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of proponents of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend is also evident in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since last year’s sharp downturn.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents stated that they were satisfied with their country’s democratic practice. That is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government, both of which are in line with last year’s figures, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This continued during the global economic crisis, perhaps, because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in moods between countries (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in stronger support for the private and market economies: 71% of respondents supra-regionally stated that the private sector is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the United States as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An Election Slip
No one expected the elections in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the constituents hurried to the help of the beleaguered country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Election offices opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, wandered around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the cancellation of the election results due to alleged fraud.
Throughout the country there have been partly violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected vote is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no voter approval, declares by the polls the winner of the by-election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organization.
Just before the start of the election, about 250,000 IDs, which are required for the election, have not yet been issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentine President Cristina Fernández experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%, the highest since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her re-election next year depends on whether the visibly mourning Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife's election, often drew up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the pair of presidents to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further disarray.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribe) Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates – and wage demands from trade unions – push the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and the fight against poverty to be his main goals, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which then fine-tune the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
She called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
But inflation undercut the growth momentum by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which looks like the first step towards the clean-up of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which for the most part has enough of churchmanship.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to them will be softened.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts, which is considered to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only a short time.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence from Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city council together with the KMT.
During the election, events such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass parades and dancers with scarce clothing occurred.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
More bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has impaired the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the CMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the CMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time the DPP also avoided fomenting anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of drawing Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated for absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of working people and youth.
Tsai received great approval as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it is also able to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forging as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's rapid approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he said the DPP candidates had done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The CMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesperson, he will reshape his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only in favour of a rapprochement to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no going back.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding surprisingly won the Newcomer of the Year award
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been overwhelmingly nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since their 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems somewhat unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her vibrant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of Spaldings nomination comes closest.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums, this favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyer's competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predatory New Orleans favorite and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", has been awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, which is more likely to feature albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society received well-deserved attention in the big-group category, pitting him against the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The Classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award feature a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
Leading the list are Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated in the Classical Producers category this year – Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium" and "The Art of the Casti" various artists.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4 at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinenkonzert" received a nomination in the category instrumental solo with orchestra.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I’ve used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestra Performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classical Crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
“The project is supported by many good people – Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others,” said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
“As an American, it makes me proud.”
"It shows that justice prevails."
“There are very few opponents,” he added.
“They’re just very loud.”
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with voices being fairly evenly distributed on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” he said.
“It’s another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand.”
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they had rented together with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new Mediterranean-style mosque of about 2,300 m2 is said to have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It will be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“This makes it something very special, even though it’s almost a kind of ‘foreign’ way of life,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found, the bacterium in California’s Mono Lake continues to grow even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You're wondering what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery “demonstrates that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the ‘standard elements’ that we think are absolutely vital are not necessarily fixed,” said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could potentially replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to its chemical similarity to phosphorus."
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another.”
"But the difference is so great that arsenic has a different effect than phosphorus, it gets into our biochemical system, where it almost smears everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic, adapting and growing.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there hasn’t been a working example yet.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff said Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs — two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis — disappeared Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were spotted Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are safe," Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They were returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not give any precise information about where the dogs were found or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
“We don’t want to say that anymore,” Whitmore explains.
“We’re following some traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were uninjured, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the competition.
Peek told the Times on Wednesday that the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple’s almost month-long tour of dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs – a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany – with them to their motel room.
The thick-edged Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the corgis, a finder's wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder’s salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new beginning.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepared" faith plan to pay off the $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually enter into force until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million planned bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself is raising $75 million, is leading the company. The financing is expected to be in place by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an order to investment bank Moelis & Co, the management company that struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year to help solve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial concerns and pay out the studio’s more than 140 beliefs lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started from scratch when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes in late October.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual schedule of seven or eight films to be released in cinemas in early 2012.
In addition, they are planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console, both of which can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, looking for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us, and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force, and this year, technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider range.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mats, $13 for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, that sing a note when pressing on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to its novel hinge feet with wheel locking, it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance instructor, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-knowler with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about collating the blocks into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more pieces.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he's holding on to some things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in our dog’s mouth.
Police missions in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan – China’s robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence – to impress viewers.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing out of teenage age, wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-and-white stripes.
"They look average to me," Mr. Tang remarked scornfully.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low staring: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled a improperly positioned snack car and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the urban police strips. They have been selected special because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They should give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
And rightly so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce the city laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his mobile phone as they beat down a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily said last year, after further controversies over the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "really thorough clean-up".
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly insufficient.
When the district searched for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women between the ages of 18 and 22 with good figure and "harmonious facial features" were searched.
They should be above average in size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 is too physically strenuous.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and “inner qualities”.
“Female Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district’s municipal administration, does not agree with this description,
However, he admitted that size specifications in job advertisements for both sexes are not uncommon in China.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is to be equated with good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical distortions do not need to apply.
“Unfortunately, we can’t use lame or buckled people here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patrolling on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cookies and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not find it sexist to place such great importance on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic glance.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short-term hiring, as they would have more ambitious career plans than just shying traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the parade deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before being chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Fr. Xu to a trader who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his pasta kitchen, which was mounted on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies leisure sales.
"Alles Routine. "
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders by threatening to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostilities, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, riotted after rumors spread that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were killed or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence so far.
However, unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk contrary to the regulations instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and proceeded with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, stayed behind, turning his white name plate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbally.”
"Sometimes, too, physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start fighting.”
Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations brought against him after his affair with a former constituent and his attempt to get her husband into lobbying, Senator’s lawyers said Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal charge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, until the scandal that made headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered the possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “highly pleased” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been discontinued and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first revealed in the New York Times in October 2009 suggested Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, helped lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton’s wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Treasurer during Ensigns' election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work, and according to the documents and interrogations he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobbying.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, “it appears to be a bargaining agreement and a violation of the revolving door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are under the government’s radar.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethics lawyers said the ministry appears very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of defeats pursued with great interest by the media, including last year’s decision to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Steven’s misconduct.
Prosecutors “are obviously terrifying,” said Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief defense attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me, just to say that we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation over a separate lawsuit by the ethics group that claimed a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An email from December 2008 proves that after Mr. Hampton moved forward as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he told him that he was "clogging" at the Home Office over a matter.
Mr. Ensign also had an appointment for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had arranged for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair first came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican rankings.
After failing to notice for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator, said he hoped the ethics commission would very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and stop its investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them typing away in the riots in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end when the verdict on the death sentence handed down by the jury comes to an end.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed motions in court setting out the reasons for an appeal and which will keep the courts busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that due to the intense reporting on the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – it has resulted in a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of upsetting details that the jury has been impermissibly influenced by the public outrage.
This objection could prompt the appellate courts to address the question of whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s chief defense attorney.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, rejected the motions by ruling briefly last week, saying that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that reporting on notorious infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, saying in its ruling that there was a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some attorneys say court claims that Mr. Haye’s conviction is considered half a century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the courtroom communication pathways that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials being pursued by a broader public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report that it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting prompt communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ attorneys outline to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury election.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her siblings, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who was a prosecutor’s critic, and that he would have impermissibly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may be of great interest.
In a judgment challenge they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the campaign for governorship and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media continuously ignited the flames of emotion about the case.
“Such a daily rush of media peeps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “has not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Her focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more intrusive than reports that are being reported at a slower pace is a tech-opposing view that impairs reporting on future trials.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often confronted with the argument that societal and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard’s conviction on the basis of the coverage, making it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can politeness connect the dividing?
After a campaign of insults and negativity, little politeness has erupted in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and congressional leaders did not bring any breakthroughs in the major issues to be dealt with during the so-called “lame duck session,” the session at the end of a government period in which decisions are no longer taken.
From what you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor an observance of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point-gathering.
The public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other calls for a sign of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment pay is to be expected, albeit only because Republicans cannot afford to believe favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, optimism has increased that these issues can be agreed during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of mismatch is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - which leads to genuine cooperation.
“I see a lot of what’s going on from today to 2012 as a pre-match, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
As concerned as the Republican leaders may be that they are playing poker too high, they know that they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and overturn health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government spending.
Vice Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own view, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan the official recommendation and they are struggling hard to even get close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, because in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama over the state budget, taxes and health care system, later followed by a phase of larger two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may be an optimistic view.
Partiality and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
From this point of view, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the American embassy in Russia reported in February in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are extorting high protective funds so that they can maintain their expensive living standards in Moscow, it is said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of authority” – takes its share of the money that moves the ladder up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on its homepage Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that he would have been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous libel lawsuits against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian TV station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, polls have found.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the Ambassador’s report, individual persons are mentioned, and it is unheard of for this to be done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'kryshna' (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection) that extends across the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
“Lastly, the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level.”
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“That’s why criminal gang protection isn’t as much in demand as it used to be.”
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will not be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or another pretext.
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions about tackling corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the embassy contains descriptions of men who went to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, said in an interview recently.
“But he’s part of this bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey of the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The unveiling of the memo of the American embassy, which took place late in the evening after Moscow time, will certainly provoke displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angryly to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and flaky walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a schoolbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal first sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member to 35 years in prison when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, making their efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into Cambodian society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s Documentation Center, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
“It divides even families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, overhaul or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government overthrew in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to overrun the government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elitist Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are anchored in the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They grew up without any professional knowledge.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought for Anlang Veng in the jungle before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to prosecute Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The task of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodia’s Documentation Centre commissioners that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were believed to have died.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
“Cambodia lives in peace and stability,” she said.
“If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
“Reconciling with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces,” he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything."
The Centre created the first government-approved school book on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Department of Education’s High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents were sceptical when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court are gradually gaining influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to no longer collect weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear material, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material -- according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about <0xC2><0xA3>500.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s “Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations” of April, which Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the [2012] Nuclear Security Summit."
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal “a very important, important step” by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How do you keep highly fortified uranium - hundreds of kilograms, which is fundamentally weaponized, and less fortified uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We will not make it into dirty bombs and we will not sell it to anyone.”
“We use it exclusively for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus, however, approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global hazard reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Reporting Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapon-capable uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the agreement, Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantanamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed “to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately monitored.”
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid of human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "have met Zapatero on the sidelines" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory.”
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised", Aguirre reports via cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government has little influence, as it is in the hands of the judges.”
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Central Intelligence Service (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," Aguirre said.
At a luncheon in March 2007, attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely keen on their independence and were doing what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments in order to soften the tension."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the government of Zapatero’s actions, which could be interpreted as potential human rights violations, has tolerated or intentionally ignored, will capitalize, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government,” he said.
The child murderer confesses that she complained on the Internet about the "difficulty" of motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: "Galician Terror"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand this, one must know their love life, which reconstructs the daily ABC on the basis of testimonies of their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his alumni never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look at the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
“When I told him that, he liked it, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and to let him do what he wants.”
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: “I want you to come back this month or send me an address I can send you the boy.”
She complains, “If he doesn’t like leaving the boy with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I get back.”
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He'll be with the one he needs to be with, that is, with me. I'll never leave him with anyone else in my life except my mother," a dubious intent when considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, but on the other hand, he is not."
"On the one hand he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She talks about a move to Mallorca.
"There he will attend a summer class, so I have fewer expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail, so if he wants to, he'll find me, like, shit."
On the 30th one: "The boy is doing well. He goes to a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked out, and in which she called herself “Muki, the jailbreaker.”
"Terror a la gallega (headline) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting overseer, declares to have a bite of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca to the provincial prison of Palma.
The defender, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the events and had no intention of inflicting harm on the Little One.
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and having stowed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at the parliamentary elections - preferential or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice that of the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while that figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote share and the binding of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would gain four (she now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People’s Party, the ERC would lose one MP – currently it has three – while ICV could hold its MP or gain one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections falls in May 2011. Even then the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist supremacy, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city councils with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona municipal council, where it would have to get 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in the turnaround of Tarragona, where they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
In Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party saw a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell obtained Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police from the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassination in 2008.
The Spanish interior minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that “Operation Kampai” has “weakened” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda worldwide and “so their ability to act”.
The researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their “fighters” could safely cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe, so in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigations. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks on EU territory in the coming days as that carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand, during which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Thaiiyung and the Sieshan Butsan were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - stole tourist passports in particular according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents must be issued on behalf of men between the ages of 25 and 45 and still have to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to bear visa stamps.
Investigative circles have underlined that so far no links have been found between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the perpetrator of the bombing was "Lashkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of the stolen and subsequently counterfeited passports in Spain and Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls on Mas to postpone tax agreement
Yesterday, the Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas her conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already presented during the campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the refusal of regionalist independence adventures, like a regional balancing point.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party turned with certainty to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a number more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties abstaining from voting in his office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As for the party leader of the PPC, the PPC demands that in support of the inauguration "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to in the Basque Country - which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, be made behind.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
On the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot nursing home do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than eleven elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they revealed the damage caused by the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people during his work for which he was in charge - to the institution.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, announcing, "La Caritat wants to indict the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only suffer a loss of social reputation because it did not establish the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat denied this point altogether, stating that “no action could at any time have been the reason for the incidents.”
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there was no evidence in the litigation of negligence by any person other than the accused.”
Baptised as a "death angel" yesterday, he confessed to eleven murders and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and that he murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said staff access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin injections and the sedative cocktail in six of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will prove whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done, according to confession, to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statements of the nurse, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could be quite longer. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that “the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk surcharges of the euro-periphery countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has hardly increased in points, which is causing concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy government debt because it is ineffective, as well as the repeal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the bond-buying program will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, yesterday’s excellent market response will be thrown back, and if we are insistent on withdrawing our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reaffirmed that it did not consider buying government bonds and that markets collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management only spent 500 million at 5.28%, compared to 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt hole figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and a possible further 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable under the rescue plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse with a view to the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
Yesterday, the Spanish Prime Minister presented the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and labour supply measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi Four Seasons.
The dual effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has grown by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we are relying on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to re-indebt.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without a deadline.
Nevertheless, our strategy should follow Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now not only the being counts, but also the appearance.”
Just courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Owls starts the shareholders meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owner of the companies owls and El Enebro, does not fade.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the company, will challenge the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, because he considers them "absolutely null and void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his children Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding company for corporate services does not appear to be willing to give in in his legal dispute over the control of El Enebro’s institutions.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which is already registered as being contested in the Commercial Register.
The meeting of shareholders of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The summons of the judge to arrange the meeting is the only legal way that ensures the convening of the meeting of shareholders.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the official meeting of January 18 declared null and void, by means of legal snippets, fraudulent machinations and misuse of rights",
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in hindsight to declare it "absolutely null and void".
The same protagonists, who cover themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - wealth company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background to the matter which the judge must decide at the hearing on the appeal case, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since entering the world of Formula 1 in 2004, Red Bull’s history has been characterised by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep climbing career during the last seasons, everyone relied on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso in the final spurt last November.
Without wanting to downplay the skills of German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are detected in the races and in the tests can be designed and executed.
Russwurm states that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the stables, who could make no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly skilled young people, who use powerful computer systems to perform analyses and make all sorts of changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager said the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be translated from the virtual reality of the simulator into reality in less than 24 hours.
The only limit to this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars a Formula 1 team can spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits – especially by journalists – are heavily restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The crew consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of its participation on the circuits are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is equal to zero.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was still possible to say that the progress in R&D for racing cars contributed to the victory with 50 percent and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed, with technology accounting for 85 percent of the success, while pilots’ contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer computers because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the existing 16 sales divisions in the multi-brand operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
As an example, HP Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a Vice President Helena Herrero mentioned the converted store on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to establish 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, including 20 offices in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), Barcelona being the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The vice president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the store opening philosophy is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive point of sale network was intended to “optimize customer service and advice to small and micro businesses when purchasing and thereafter, even the packaging.”
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants to ‘steal’ one million customers in three years
Banco Sabadell executive board member Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejecting a new liquidity crisis and predicting the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he anticipates a fall in interest rates, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject still to exist.
Sabadell has found a way to make the most of the next three years and to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose - that is the great challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year, it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has confused all of the banks’ plans.
Sabadell will complete its four-year-old Optima Guidance Plan this year, which was initially designed to last three years, but was extended by one fiscal year due to market conditions.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a long reach".
The manager assumes that Spain is only "slowly" coming out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which punishes interest margins - will blunt, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issuances to maintain liquidity will already be rolled over to the price of loans as compensation for shrinking profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We didn’t shoot the cock, but the interest rate differentials are very high,” Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the issuance of long-term loans and increase interest differentials (see Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategie of "raising fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if the group does not, as always, exclude corporate business.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain “larger companies are necessary.”
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently “growing enormously” and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
Assured that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dismisses the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing could be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing could be achieved through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
ECSC excludes a second wave of mergers between savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that there could be a wave of mergers of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted that they did not participate in the first phase, and they retained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered a second round, it was an adjustment."
"Most of it is completed. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration was carried out “as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely procedure established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a,” he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 billion assets to 17 with 75.5 billion each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed the sobering and nonsensicalness" because "Banco de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a urges us to conclude in time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems in Europe and "perhaps" in the whole world, adding that those who questioned would do so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have gone through a “very significant” concentration process that will be carried out “as soon as possible”.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has opted to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the repeal of the €426 support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, which has evoked the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is adopting a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which clashes with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of most of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the South would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German Mark - although at the moment this sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a restructuring of the euro according to German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that fail to comply; possible withdrawal of payments from some countries, as well as the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been showing for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out of its hands a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the disconnect between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to rescue Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union’s agreements to allow the rescue of a country while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it drove forward the Irish crisis and all that followed.
But their proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which is to enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area in which the infringing countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, in which case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to embark on a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as cited by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly to not understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like anything would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should not have to leave the euro area, which has been completely blocked with little reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rule circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show an inventive spirit, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will comply with the prescribed sanction in the next league game against Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos – the unwritten but adhered to rules in this sport.
Part of the debate over the case depicted is that a Real Madrid football club team (who in his anthem claimed nobility and honor and on other occasions had punished its players for similar incidents) played the lead in this, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is explicitly prohibited by the statutes, does not contradict the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a circumvention of the rules, which in fact is consistent with the statutes of the sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the opposing players from gaining an unjustified benefit from the opposing team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand by false play or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly carried out to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders drew from the intentional fouls.
It should be emphasized here that the rival was neither placed in a less favourable position nor required advantages for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, to a certain degree uncertain, as the team could eventually also retire. In addition, with this approach, players will receive a sanction and move on to the second card cycle, in which they leave with a card less than in the first cycle due to card accumulation.
It is not clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the regulations.
In this case, players did not want to bypass a penalty (this would actually be a clear case of rule bypass), they were more likely to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or escaping punishment.
Although the boundary between invention and rule environment is blurred, I believe this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transfer.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Group Christmas dinners in Barcelona - offer-offensive
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which supply Barcelona’s restaurant and leisure industry with oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture also the customer segment that constitutes the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the interviewees confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year’s Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13th, resulting in an avalanche of reservations from dinners to two top dancers (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to renounce this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant committee, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the umbrella association does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think about it a hundred times before they book.”
“They want to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices,” he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with good service", he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euros are most in demand.
A survey of several centrally located restaurants shows that the evening of December 17th leads to the collapse of the providers.
The Soteras Group says demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain last year's prices with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which runs El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 venues, optimism is not lost after revenues have been blooming again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business are expected, albeit focused on a few days.
Sources from the company group point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
Added to the six group menus a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more as a price hit, with the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are again in the upswing.
From the side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, relies on seeing the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "take out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not diminished, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
WikiLeaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the WikiLeaks website, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
On the fringes of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but on the contrary “decreased”, and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons “to a faster rhythm” than any other country.
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack – is preparing Washington sleepless nights.
The Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material.”
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen by not only the US, but also Russia as exaggerating and a reason to exercise caution.
“Pakistan has to hire strictly credible personnel to guard nuclear installations; due to its low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to participate in nuclear or missile programs,” said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation unveiled by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is declining and the pace at which Pakistan is manufacturing nuclear weapons is elevated.
In May, an embassy office that describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" said: "There is often no transparency; we don't get any responses to aid offers or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, an official with the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirmed that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by Chief of Staff General Ashfaq Kayani to “clarify to the person in charge” that “Pakistan’s army has to cease its tacit oversight of terrorist groups.”
Hunting for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorism officer to prevent further revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to unravel.
Interpol issued a "red warning" yesterday about Assange's "discovery and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, it comes from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the latest revelation of more than four million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
The lawyer of WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens also assured the police “would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange "in order to temporarily arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free-letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is presumably present.
The move outraged Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s chief of security, with the corresponding approval.
“It’s like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia asserts the innocence of her son - Assange is in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, asking for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for the ordering of North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to pay less attention to Assange stands in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to seize their funds and anyone who supports or contributes to them.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange must be “murdered.”
“Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and all that is not execution is one too mild punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on his continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the eleventh time of an internal riot in the ranks of the directionless ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the vote.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for those close to the former party leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its mentor itself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could comment on his stay in office in secret.
With ballot papers, not with an upright hand.
If the Carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he reaffirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and without specifying percentages, he added that a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod proxies demand more from the president than just to make his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation, which the management will present to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
In return, Puigcercós promises to move Congress to the fall of 2011, which the party leadership already believes is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the “polyphony” damages stability and he aims once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current Councillor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the “restructuring” of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, which means the inclusion of new faces from Carod’s environment.
The second might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the principle of plenary assembly as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcercós’ team, which has already fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the General Assembly model – an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the shaking 2008 assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of the general assembly at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle of the internal turmoil of recent years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the line, the time might have come to pick up on this issue again and end it forever.
23 Killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four fewer cases were recorded in Mexico than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México counts, four fewer than the previous month.
Among the murdered are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we see a total of 390 deaths, which are probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots caused by firearms, the pardon shot was given to his head, and his feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the street Mixtecas in the settlement of Santa Cruz Acatlán in the municipality of Naucalpan.
On Thursday, the 4th, early morning, farm workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body, a message was found, probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage driver.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds died as a result of shots in the head in the settlement of San Pedro Xaloxtoc in the village of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the corpse of a man with the pardon shot in the forehead was found on a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo and under the body a shell shot down with a caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewage channel of the settlement Playa Golondrina.
The emergency department searched for the remaining parts of the body, but could not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a corpse they had discovered in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, with hands tied to the back and head tied.
The man had a wound that came from a firearm shot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, reports were made of the murder of two men wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza, in addition to two death threats.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan they found the body wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket of a man who, according to the message that his killers left next to him, was probably named Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman with firearms shots in the neck was found.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of Santa Muerte were discovered, as well as chains with corresponding illustrations.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle in the municipality of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with tape, and a message were discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message presumably signed by a criminal organization that read: "This happens to those who do not participate."
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the justice center of the settlement of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl communities.
The first had been beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón and tied up in black plastic bags, next to it was a message. The second had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China upholds greenhouse gas reduction targets
The Chinese representative said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support of pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities of the states have worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, some multi-year plans have already been launched or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Effective Use of Energy program, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another to replace traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another to mitigate and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, the government’s science advisor on climate change in the country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than was commonly assumed.
He showed that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use: energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent in the last five years and another one is expected to happen by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist party chairman had the right to contact the National Commission of Order and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party leader of the PAN had the right to contact the National Ordinary Commission and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview, which took place before the appeal, Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espino’s exclusion was a decision that had been made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the ordering commission in Sonora."
“Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision by a competent body,” he added.
On the other hand, he said, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged strengthened from the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor is elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far; it was a prelude to the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the best chairman or chairmen needed by Acción Nacional for the next three years, so he would hand over the squats "to those the Council would appoint."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open, and I'd be proud to hand over the chairmanship to each of the five."
He predicted that the party’s upswing in the last July 4 elections would be reflected in the next elections, although “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his job."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country, therefore "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the demands."
When questioned about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón over his discourse during his four-year rule, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year term of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Calderón governments, they should start defending them if they finally get out of the closet,” he said.
He believes that the holder of the federal government could make expressions like those he could make in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban, let alone censorship.
Obama on Twitter advocates for the law in favor of undocumented students
“If you’re in favor of enacting the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the enactment of this act,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Law to Legalize Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favor of enacting the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the enactment of this act,” Obama tweeted.
His e-mail contains a cyberlink to a larger document that calls on the public to contact their senators minuscule as the bill’s vote is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he said.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law except the expansion of tax cuts from the Bush era and the government’s funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Speaker Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the remaining projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would “request the vote at the end of the debate” so that the Dream Act could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, during the last five years of living in that country and enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the proponents of the bill need sixty votes to pass the bill, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That’s why defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most successful Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican, John McCain, has not yet decided his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Senate Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles.
Putting your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants stood up for the narrative
"I understand that with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la langue', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event she explained the round table was dedicated to sex in the language).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentinean writer sweetly spitted out to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero took part.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, from which although she does not receive an answer, but hints for the guide to her narrative.
She tells the infectologist, “Patience is not my strength, maybe it’s my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the aisle, but who explained to her that wound was not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst unravels the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs relieved and concludes that she "she only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'praise of invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With references to magical realism, he tells of a famous wizard who touched the clouds, brought back far travelled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story turned around and told of America, the great novel that was not lacking from the beginning of his own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo, the story of the overflow.
“Cervantes, who invited us all, mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told—with imaginative power that even lost the sense of shame.”
However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He calls it the “tradition of Cervantes.”
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL’s invitation to the round table ‘The Finger in the Wound’ had contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, unintentionally planned commitment,” she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and readers as if in a “chemical response.”
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, too, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness lead to dogmatism, forgetting that “behind every confirmation there is a small ‘no’ and behind every denial there is a small ‘yes’.”
"To be in possession of our thoughts and of reality, we must nuance: And nuances often mean putting the finger in the wound and harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also harass the powerful who prefer to write the world in black and white.
Romano is fighting for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced both ups and downs in his career, but he played decisive games three times.
In the final match between Santos Laguna and Monterrey, there are also two different styles, defined by their respective coaches, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced both ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has maintained himself well, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has won the medal for second champion, he has stayed one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santistic strategist reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to make another setback, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalties he came forward with 3-1 and had two chances to plug his title, but ultimately missed three of his players and eleven steps.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be chased again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reaffirms that for him the game itself is the most important thing.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give myself to, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the driver commented when asked about the lost finals.
"The only lesson we can learn from this is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we're ready on the line, the players, too, because the last time we were ready to leave with two penalties, and I don't think there's any lesson to be learned, until the game is a feat."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalties doesn't bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at penalties, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we were prepared to keep this game in the hands, the fate of this game is already in the end, sometimes in the end.
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer just be second champion and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must introduce themselves to the visa application service points at the consulate before their conversation; costs will be reduced by waiting times.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa at the U.S. embassy and consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must introduce themselves to the Visa Application Service Centres (ASCs) before they meet at the consulate.
ASC staff will record the applicant’s biometric data, which will be checked by the Consulate prior to the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant only makes a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counter price is $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with an application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation at the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation at the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service surcharge of $26.
Additional information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The North American space agency has convened a press conference to present a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aerospace Administration (NASA) of the United States announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the time of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory finding for the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments previously thought to be uninhabitable, and it was hypothesized that they could turn into intelligent beings – just like humans – if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment thought to be too toxic for all imaginable life forms, as the lake is heavily arsenic-containing.
In some way, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource, and taking this ability into account, the chances increase that there could be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually another life form, a second life form, which is different from the one known to us."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference the actual range of its find.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon) on whether its chemical composition resembles that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the organ law on the Congress will introduce the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th Legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves as independent, had already set up. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the Chamber.
Before the introductory session began in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded by this.
With this reform, they repeated, a “two-party system” would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties, who controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the bureau headed by panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their marginal political position with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
“I come here [the opposition coalition], that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even consider taking into account the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be admitted, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be "duo-political".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress.”
“Initially, this group starts with five MPs and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more,” said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, referring to PAN and PRI, stated that the Congress had at the moment turned into a 'loot' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they split it in two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and assign them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five, which are currently seen as divided into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of his reform, which was carried out by the others and agreed upon, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 Pesos more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlán is paying another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical equipment.
Another cheque of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company in the second half of the year for electrical equipment is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque, issued in the amount of 200,144,56 pesos, with the number 9258447, was issued on November 16, with the purpose of "invoicing open accounts".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to this supplier. She is monitored by the Auditor<0xC3><0xAD>a Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, as a result, the number of cheques still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it's just paying off the debt, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last one from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for its services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the audit of cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, it was announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad image on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the trade association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and turn the poor conditions that tourists encounter into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had had a negative effect as the tourists came to stroll and saw the disorder, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians do not know what it means to have to close a company one day and they do not worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community has to take on its responsibilities and avoid this happening again. How to do it? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unmaintained and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlan."
"Nowadays, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in the fire," he added.
"These precautions have not been given enough attention and these types of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Under-Secretary of Promoción Tur<0xC3><0xAD>stica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not used properly and gave rise to a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore along with the city. To make the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to supply them to the inventory we are advertising for this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business sector in Mazatlán is calling for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and to the different social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility to set a model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
“We hope that the MPs will really exercise their right to act free from any collusion between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival compars of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and above all stand up for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the great challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and the joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in some way will promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the state budget to promote it.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, state security must be supported, and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is Wanted
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are eagerly desired by the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
On the next Three Kings Day, it will be difficult for parents to fulfill these wishes, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes there are hard times because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go to the street with the goren for sale," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time now and for his eight-month-old brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, Cayetana proposes clothes in the size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster so much,' but I said to him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe is a size 12; the ten-year-old Isaias is a size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the lobby of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network around the ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region were carried out.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in the places that are said to have served predominantly the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men considered to be the main wire pullers of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale, conspiracy and service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigative activity that took place for over a year.
"The information obtained from the public authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around 70 police officers from the Estrien Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be prosecuted
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says is supposed to address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, is expected to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I strongly oppose this charter.”
“I’m holding on to a party that has put shackles on your feet,” Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberal Party, said after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person to be detained for up to a year by a seagoing vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
Criticism of Olivia Chow’s immigration issue, NDP, has dismissed critics who claim her party did not behave steadfastly enough to covert immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is exactly what we are trying to enforce through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks the blame on the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians strongly inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of covert immigration, these criminal processes that affect Canada and treat the country like a pedestrian.”
"They expect Canada to take tough action," Kenney's response said.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its bill that could have led the country to elections that would have rejected the government.
However, a Conservative has told the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposition MP would immediately declare himself to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on October 29, last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
There was also no shortage of Stéphane Bergeron, a critic and member of the Parti Québécois, who qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit enchanted from the hat" as well as "a solution correctly crafted at the end of the table".
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future unity in question.
“You will see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only means of forming a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and political systems at ENA.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to grant a special mandate to the Financial Audit Office, so that it can carry out appropriate investigations into corruption and secret arrangements.
“One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control,” he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the audit control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This request comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has flowed in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A road has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation have poured over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimeters more precipitation was expected here according to the regions by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais valley were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since snow melting, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, can be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued warnings about the flood warning concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentian mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has resulted in the crossing of several lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn off due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State Flood Centre issued warnings of the sharp rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly corrected
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) for his controversial remarks about social welfare and Haitians as well as for his ill-advised speeches about radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that although Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinion, certain statements would contain "inaccurate information about social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such an unholy speech that is not appropriate for broadcasts throughout the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violated the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Instead, the moderators should provide solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had expressed the view that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message conveyed here was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board took into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed for his person.
The last point of contention was the statements that had related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-effective discussion on this subject that had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he did not donate to Haiti aid, as it was not known for sure whether the needy would really receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already waived my three-day suspension sentence in this case."
“My file has been virginal for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of unprincipled language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster had acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, now rises to the Tatami and into the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“Twelve years ago I started in Algeria with martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing,” said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the pros.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground combat, as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, the man working as a security officer and employed at the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championships held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"At the moment I am preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"It was invited those fighters from every category who had placed themselves in the top four at the last World Cup."
"I babe brought in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
In 2005, I became eighth in Vietnam.
“In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China, in which punching and kicking are permissible as well as throwing ground.
The duels are usually played on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer to emerge from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest ranking and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic poundsman.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed to grant project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie Gérance, was formed in 2004 as a side effect of Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector to this important, $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that evokes the risk of competition and price increases.
“This is a new way of playing a game that is off-limits and disarms the competition.”
"This means that instead of playing games in a secret way, you are now conducting them in an open form," PQ MP Sylvain Simard told the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to him to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Resources, responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that the contract was a carded game.
“I remain true to my line,” she said, adding that the PQ was “unholy” and “missing hardness.”
She said it was “the minimum” for the PQ to apologize.
The model of the consortium is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually a time-consuming alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in bidding on a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and should be set up by 2012.
Nonetheless, the contract was awarded without any competition; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief fly-over of the Quebec business register allows the nomination of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each link, and of which there are several dozen, refers to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been taking this fact into account in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose about the fact that the contract for project management has been approved by agreement.
“If you put up a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket.”
"So you have two options: either you take the people on this mart and say to yourself, 'You're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.'"
"However, the idea is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the consortium "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts per se, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without accounting for their participation in "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "<0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance" for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had reported that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are well known to the "Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that "financed" it, before specifying that it was rather their executives.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Green, but undefeated skepticism.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but neither in the brands or eco-labels that are supposed to control his choice.
Too bad, even though it bathes in a media-efficacy universe, where it is brimming with information in favor of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to lament, an inadequacy that was identified as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading showed yesterday.
Although they pushed the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits that they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as much as green corporate advertising, according to the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
Following the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption nevertheless seems important in stimulating this consumption segment, which is currently invigorated by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake, identified by the barometer, after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to put at their fingertips.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, 61% of them had also preferred purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum of 100 this year - Quebec's Homo consumus loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they used public transport or preferred the carpooling center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been invited by Société Angus and the company Parallelle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallelle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, to hand it over to its actual cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they demanded.
The government has agreed to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower level than initially expected, which could create a viable solution to favorable conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources extracted from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request has since been revised downwards again.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallelle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec-based community of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture has no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he did not also send to other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, claimed substantial economic assistance.
After the self-funded construction of the cinema, Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exception on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clients at bay.
The Société Angus and the company Parallelle with Christian Yaccarini at the helm, for their part, are leading a privately funded campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallelle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of Xavier Beauvois's very successful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini did not remove the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals made to them.
Secret of Complex Shaken Canada Revealed
The new U.S. diplomatic leadership, spread by WikiLeaks, unravels the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Americans, but with the same blow reveals the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind in the election process, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the Conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content you have to nibble on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the missions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador stationed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent inferiority complex among Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders much more to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States into this election (like the 1988 free trade campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind at the ballot box as a key factor."
The other expression of this sense of importance can be found in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence of the vote of confidence in the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade resulting from a $30-40 billion revival program,” Breese said.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the resulting continuation of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another January 2008 message, written by Ambassador Wilkins, communicates Washington’s increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast on CBC broadcasting from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programs such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even abductions for the purpose of interrogations carried out by muscle protrusions of the CIA.
Another communication details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he said, “he handed a paper to the secretary of state regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
“The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again.”
Finally, let’s note that the minds are heating up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had told CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be “defeated.”
He had spoken here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan to renew lighting
In Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew lighting for households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, equivalent to nearly a third of the additional reduction needed to be realized to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the footsteps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from the developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs released to the earth due to illumination would be avoided if the white glow bulbs, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the exhaust gases in the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emission emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that would bring global CFC emissions down from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, one would have to subtract 5 Gt to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius between now and 2020, to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces the light.
The compact fluorescent bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED bulbs reduce this energy requirement by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips launched this week – by the way, this company has participated in the UN study – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white glowing bulb, indicating the savings possibilities of the replacement plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely novel light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a reception point.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would make from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election of Ivory Coast immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press spokesperson for the UN chief.
“He calls on all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results.”
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CIS had confirmed on television that the Commission would “continue with the work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from all over the world were made that the CIS may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were obtained by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of Ivory Coast's presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo’s lawsuits are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically close associate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and that a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for any riots.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis is established at 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter but wished to find a job, including whether they were working every two weeks or not and whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, saw a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months as well as over the year), i.e. 482,000 of people over 50 years of age, 6.6% involving overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds were able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute over its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to use this method, announcing on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne (PS) region, and he was taken to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected fraud markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement, embezzlement of general property, theft, corruption, illicit bribery and gun ownership, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him, instead of spreading wits."
"It's easy to put a number of criminal charges against him, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made it important to send a memorandum to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers to justify it.
One of Guérini’s relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill, which he had to run, running.
With regard to the area of business competence or the destination of the related funds, he would never have known.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the public service of the metropolitan area of Aubagne, was also indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then under the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision, released.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The senior prosecutor has taken into account not depriving him of his freedom," his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four more people had been indicted and released from prison on Tuesday night, including two under legal supervision, according to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for “unauthorized influence and passive bribery”.
Two state officials of the metropolitan area of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one for the title "Hijacking and embezzlement of general property by a public servant", the other for "committal involvement in embezzlement of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "heinry and embezzlement of social property".
Among those facing Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned for a similar case of fraudulent public schemes affecting Corsica.
The criminals suspect his company of helping to launder money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in this case in particular in the disposal sector, will be carried out in the files of several open investigations in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters.
It is clear from close sources that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the procurement and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Aubagne region, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: Elysée Palace exaggerates its role as mediator for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", held the French public in breath, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostage-taking” in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how French officials have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman does not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man held in France and wanted by the American judiciary for trade in material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media in order to make it credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way of Dealing with Hostage Taking".
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to return their own nationals who were being forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do so.”
Because "silence solves nothing", past the attempts at discussion over inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to take place on August 16, the day she escapes to the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 deposit).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago but is still being held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is calling for because of illegal trade in sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from detention after the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under “strict” supervision by the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser dialed a telephone number, put it back on, then informed the American diplomat that the Iranians “were currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad play an "important" and "influential mediator role" by means of announcements and media-organized "escape attempts".
Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 summons "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is the basis of so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy asks.
“Despite their full statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.”
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to forfeit this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts “are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "perceived by many critics in France and abroad as premature and unearned".
“Syria’s role in building up is trying to show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “seed discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, Richier told her: “Of course we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countrywoman".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Ashtray,” which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, government officials said.
A bill calling on online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, according to representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
“Many kids play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also living a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, ministerial commissioner of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6am.
The manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also looking to ask the manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
FIFA World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
The FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the introduction of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had once again given it breeding ground on Monday by airing a documentary report that takes under fire three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English officials who had been lobbying intensely with David Cameron in recent weeks.
The head of government hopes to re-issue the chess move that his predecessor Tony Blair had succeeded in winning the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort suffice to re-evaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in treasures with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadions, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the undisclosed allegation of the accusations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the members of the committee.
“You throw them dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, appears to be the logical favorites.
The first world economic power, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the long-awaited approval by FIFA of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes the Asian chances to 2022 null and void.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all records with the attendance of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time delay) acquitted by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second Mandate: Obviousness
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he was stubborn.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next one.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not look well at the side of the mystery attached to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that there is doubt from now on.
In one sense as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
That he would sound the prospect of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians had spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far missing.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he has mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me at your worst, or at your best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from the day before make him no more a candidate than the day before; but no less.
If there are any comments, there are two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are admonishing for combat earlier than assumed.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, the voters of the right would prefer a candidacy by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to a survey by BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about this," the Prime Minister's environment responded immediately and carefully.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who agreed with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the ordering of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures that should come to a close by the end of the year.
The European debt crisis obliges the central bank in Frankfurt, no doubt, not to be able to afford even today’s more than tense situation in the European bond markets, so as not to cause their exacerbation.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s public debt.
She has not dared to say whether she thinks the central bank can do even more, for example by boosting its program of buying government bonds.
"I keep my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
The President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not speak very bluntly about his plans the previous day in Brussels at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but rather was content to point out that the program of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would be "continued" and that we will look like the decisions at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury’s bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to around 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, it is said that yesterday it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Traders do not doubt the anticipation of a continued tracking of the purchase price (see page 29).
The economists are no longer expecting a remarkable change in course.
If bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB will continue to create unrestricted cash reserves in a generous manner over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already preparing that this measure will be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine the ECB going to change its programme in a substantial way.”
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases that will revive the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the eurozone debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must come to the placers of the lacking investors on the market at any price and act in such a way to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest countries," a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to fly high, states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, yesterday the situation has relaxed a bit with the drop in key interest rates to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the region's president Giulio Tremonti had described the situation as "unnumberable" and had heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at least, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain terms, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dizzy tax revenues, which put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for consideration by the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (up from 2.7%).
Hence also the turmoil over a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, both in the short term and in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is called for less stabilisation progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
So there is an unfavourable period ahead for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said: “I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency area.”
Although completely relative, yesterday's deduction in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, the beginning of normalization cannot yet be mentioned.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt record, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which weighs heavily on the banking systems," according to the opinion of the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is going on much slower than that of markets".
The European countries, who are well aware of both this gap and the danger hidden therein, are intensifying discussions on strengthening the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and, more broadly, with their counterparts to the G20 are proceeding well.
And this is also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the countries of the eurozone are on the agenda in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund is expected to issue its first commercial paper expenditures next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative entrusted the agency to Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in funds mobilized by the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the first countries, are ready to undertake structural reforms, in particular in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will add to the austerity measures, but will have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are taking a different path than Greece and Ireland have.
On both sides, it is a matter of avoiding the need to seek international assistance, at any cost, before they have drawn up their own budget corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors, on the other hand, are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take another step in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, who are at the forefront of the European debt market, believe that an extension of around 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions are worsening.
Snow and frost: 24 departments at alarm level Orange
The snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on alert level Orange due to the imminent snow and frost risk.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have added to the 20 departments already in alarm stage Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also of 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm, are expected in the Paris region.
Affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are noticeable enough to cause traffic impediments and impair certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac roads.
The traffic situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise you to use your own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
"The Prefecture calls on drivers to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Paris’ Roissy airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
To begin the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend a portion of the financial sum twice in the markets.
Today, we finally got our first estimates.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax for the development and the higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
“The revenue from this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year.”
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not figured in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment, which will be raised by the state and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement reads.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"Since the moment you get revenue (the two taxes, i.e., R.R.), you can cover the projecting over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it explains.
“This will be recorded in the budget and gradually deducted.”
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to note the $4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion promises can be sought for a long time, runs the risk of provoking a rather troubled, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge hackers and spies
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level and gives a glimpse of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go one step further.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw away nothing more than what you've been reading for months anyway in every x-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and Gaddafi's terrifyingly caricatured profile has been offering their cabaret artists their stuff for years.
The rule that the secret files must consist only of known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that each work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (yet because he does not know where news about the non-existent could be found), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
Why, then, was such a nuisance made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then even the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world holds the significant blow against the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims, rather than the "judges" in distress.
But let’s devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But when one sees what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control system ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as the avenger of the citizen – can uncover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets stand?
True, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi’s or Merkel’s character is basically a secret free from secrecy, as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks were to reveal any robbery, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton’s secrets meant to be secrets.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer put any reserved information online - that would be like a sticking out on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a head of state travelled on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romance, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, secretly moving on uncontrollable routes, carrying their communications nowhere but in mere memory, and moreover the little written information they have received in Schuberg.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing nowadays like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegraph using (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had allowed film researchers to explore a film band by band by spooling from the back to the front and uncovering all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro-portions.
High-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while it takes three and a half hours by plane, including transfers.
It is therefore not uncommon for politics and communication technology to come back by car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France talks nicely about its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the swiftly-dissolved financing promises (also called “fast start” or premature financing) realized by developing countries.
And already the coarse French fine speeches have been revealed.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, major side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly valued: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional commitment was made without going to the detriment of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that they deem best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained, and under the "Fast-Start" funding, 150 million will be added over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of the year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In return, France believed that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for spending in the previous year or at the global level of public development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses their computational mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 € borrowed as equivalent to 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often related to emissions reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro that is taken as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be counted as the rate of interest.
But France has nothing else in the sense than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking out 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses large amounts of loans.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are fulfilling their commitments 100% with donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the issue of long-term financing (another issue that is crucial and currently under discussion): one does not escape the question of "predictability" or the way in which his loans are booked.
France could change its position to be as progressive on issues of dispute as it is on other things.
So the hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “predictability” and the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemicals during the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "given the small number of samples analyzed do not reflect a statistically significant value, but represent an illustrative character of the problem treated", had bought between July and September the food usually consumed by a child of about ten years old at meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – have been studied as well as snacks from laboratories looking for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The dish balance is crushing: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or likely carcinogenic and five as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruption factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if in the approximate totality of cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, it is very clear from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruption factor is alarming," notes the association.
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the chopped steak, the tuna from the can, and even the baguette and chewing gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
