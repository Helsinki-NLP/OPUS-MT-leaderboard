Food to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation in the eurozone is the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November – after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, according to the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, British and Canadian central bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered interest rates; in its discretion, the interest rate cut would favour rising commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment, leading to the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in a state of turmoil: inflation has to be “reconciled” in order to rule out the need for further action.
At 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in Germany reached a 12-year record high in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Increased food and energy prices are responsible for rising inflation in the eurozone.
MATIF wheat prices rose 88 percent, and soybean prices also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also experienced a significant deterioration in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose by 52 percent this year – last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly US$100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3% inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1%.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice.
Gallup Determines Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown significantly until the beginning of December, the party has the largest base camp for the first time since 2002, while the support for the socialists has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference among party-like voters is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of support for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: they reach two percent of the total population.
The number of party voters in both camps has grown by one percent.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic sentiment has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "quite bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects the situation to deteriorate further; only one-tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — rated the prime minister’s work as “better bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents generally have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán accounts for 38 percent.
Some 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political sentiment is the number of people who think that one could manage dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
After the riots last October, 35% had spoken out for the remainder of the government and the head of government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would “safely” participate, and another 20 percent would “probably” cast their vote.
For comparison: if the parliamentary elections were to take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the polls "with certainty", another 15 percent consider their participation "probable".
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day allowance.
Turned to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Alsoan most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs commercial triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets were "davongalopped" last December, the price increase has not fallen drastically, compared to the already high, earlier initial level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid for last year was still well below HUF 9,000, and this year is not even available for HUF 10,000.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least HUF 91 in the markets studied.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for unicum and live fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, while prices for turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread awakenings for 139 forint.
There was no competitive price drop on the product to below 200 forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 forint, so the drink including pledge cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year's "Napi" basket comparison also scored the most expensive, and Cora the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" basket compared to Christmas prices last year increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan each increased by 18 percent.
The difference between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and today’s most expensive shopping cart was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest shopping cart and current year’s most expensive shopping cart was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still 1,206.00 forint, but the VAT increase was noticeable in prices last Christmas.
This is precisely the process that has hit the trade badly: Apparently the department stores could not quite decide which price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the impact of the price increase on consumer behavior was unpredictable.
(If the dealer poorly plans the speed of a product, he can fall by substantial profits in the price range, which is based on the intensity of traffic.)
Due to VAT, the price of the "Napi" basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forints, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 forints.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 forints more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1,284.00 forints.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office found a rise of more than 30 percent over the 12-month period.
So in addition to flour and eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product, already expensive in the previous year, has risen by barely more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll off the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trading triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the tables.
Wednesday morning there were endless lines at the checkout in all three department stores, when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, the country reports a lower frequency of customers, so many multis complain to opinion pollsters that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Savings on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not exactly conducive to the containment of infections, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital, but shortly thereafter the man had to return with an MRSA infection. A major operation could not be performed since because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
By December 10 of this year, 1094 hospitals reported infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the senior physician of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have certainly been recorded in hospitals, but the dark figure is likely to be higher.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the methicillin-oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without it causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat inflammation, tonsil inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the agents are dosed too high or used improperly, antibiotic-resistant bacteria develop, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently malfunctioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of everyday hospital life.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA does not exist only where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
“Such patients are being isolated, the caregiver wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment,” says Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are hospitalized, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of MRSA-induced infections in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the containment of the multidrug-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine the admitted patients and isolate MRSA-infected immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not so often practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no grants from the state health insurance for this investigation.
Most cases therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the part of the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological tests are necessary so that no resistance to the agent can develop, but this directive is also not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the outpatients, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even rarer, says Karolina Böröcz.
Savings on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted by caregivers from one patient to another.
This is precisely why hand washing or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in the local hospitals.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds lined closely together, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to point out, unfortunately, in the financially less well-off hospitals it even happens that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that favor the development of infections.
Such infections are demonstrably far less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs to health insurance companies, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was included in the government program.
After the first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has made prevention of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Police chief wasn't drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned chief of police of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under the influence of drugs, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official report on the case was presented.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to the police chief, had not consumed alcohol before he sat down at the wheel.
The former police chief drove his own car into Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at an unmarked location.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a mitigating circumstance - the handlebars have, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra strip, subordination .)
The pedestrian died of his injuries after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, subsequently quit his duties and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office has launched its investigation into the incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
A further EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday, the money will go to education, transport and environmental protection infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects carried out with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier and the current agreement deals with the use of the EUR 200 million awarded.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose to Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement worth EUR 50 million, which will mainly be invested in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also discussed.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be re-discussed.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest is EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferral of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is paying close attention to the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most coveted pavement for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also in increasing demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russia registers more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive offers - commercial and office spaces offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive European golfing paradises, attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are already buying on a large scale, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy real estate in Bulgaria also want to change their lifestyle.
Most of the buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while the Black Sea and ski resorts are predominantly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle will either buy revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or run-down houses for 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connections and accessibility as well as communication options are very important, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of increasing their value in the medium to long term.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-increasing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian Percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will conclude on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali roadmap, which sets the emission-reducing measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a fierce debate between developed and developing countries.
The United States has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but it would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other big question at the conference is whether the industrialized countries are prepared to support developing countries financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be part of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as reflected in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister declared that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether or not the "2012 agreement" will be successfully achieved. The Union would even be willing to push for a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrialised countries in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their commitments to the fullest extent possible and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, whereas the EU and its 15 member states had already committed themselves to a minus of 8 per cent.
The target for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the years 1985-87 - a target that the country will certainly meet, as can be seen in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until after 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which also the IPCC, the international, with the UN Nobel Peace Prize awarded, has highlighted in its recent scientific report the UN Climate Change Co.
This would delay the emission reduction, and increasing the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army advertises on YouTube
British Army units have posted footage of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The shots, shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets, are checked at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are posted on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenseheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi-based international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of the foreign missions.
Propaganda published in this way is almost free compared to conventional television advertisements, according to defense expert Gordon Mackenzie at the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored footage, also makes it into the net - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are talked about at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, numerous videos shot in use have already been uploaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genus" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Amerikas Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-saving simulation.
Christmas party with tombola and pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means squeamish: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a working conference where her employees can end the year 2007 with coffee and pogasse.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure up the Christmas mood with tombola or push into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices as well.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the Department of Defense, but the employees of the ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Celebration of the Orphans" children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The department provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport are pushing through the strands.
The 4.32 million forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola raffle.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (ILO), with concerts and a festive dinner.
The hall rent was 1 million forint, the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration, which is organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent authorities.
Why the suit?
The ILO building was not only open to NFÜ guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO to use the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was communicated: There was no ball dress or suit obligation on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are preparing for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for the employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to the conference for the end of the year.
It is expected that around 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are hosted only with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forint.
Self-government Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply be kicking off in the ministry's classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is holding a Christmas party in its own banquet hall, where 436 employees are expected to attend.
Expenditures were measured at 2,500 forints per capita - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent kicking.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate in this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party mood - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year's reception on January 20th, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry this time skips.
One hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the department, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally begin with a brief address from the minister and sound with restrained delights.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, no information could be given to the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is held in the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike that begins on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, on Monday - the day of the popular vote on the Health Insurance Act - the laying down of work begins.
Strike-related, significant traffic impediments are expected, as rail traffic is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are also on strike until 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will settle the work indefinitely, unless an agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike that began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only come in the late evening hours, or even at midnight, to the vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strikes, which begin on Monday, will have to be expected to result in significant traffic impediments: the railway workers cease their work indefinitely, in the morning the majority of the public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are shut down.
At the same time, in many places there will be roadblocks in one direction.
The call for strikes has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the League website.
Some organizations announced strikes indefinitely, others plan a temporary job cut.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement on sufficient services could be reached between the Hungarian Railway M<0xC3><0x81>V and the Free Trade Union of Railways VDSZSZ, although more and more people are travelling by train just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV strikes from the start of operations until 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy stop work for four hours, and the Teachers’ Union or the Democratic Teachers’ Union have called for strikes of 2 or 2-8 hours, respectively.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians strikes alternately at different times nationwide, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the League is that the government withdraw the draft health insurance reform and submit a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which is due from next year.
Requirement number three is that eligible occupational groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ belonging to the League of Trade Unions did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the secondary lines and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases state risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk represents the "intensification of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is presumably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups that have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition."
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor limbs, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guards, not least thanks to the enormous attention from the domestic and foreign media, "have significantly damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously on the rise, so that since the summer of 2007, several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded.
“It is common for these groups to define themselves as a civilian organization, while bragging openly about preparing their members for – sometimes armed – defense tasks (disaster protection, national defense, security), citing the incapacity of the police, the army, or the state itself,” it said.
And furthermore, all this is done according to that method, which attempts to disguise various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party resentment of the population.
The emphasis on civil character and the form of association are therefore not only used to circumvent legal hurdles that could arise in the course of registration in court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents immediately as the reason for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national protection".
In their opinion, a real "gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria over the past 17 years, but the state has remained indifferent and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
The initiative would have triggered a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic strife is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organising their own protection, says the risk warning report from Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and should risk-changing trends be discernible, public opinion will be informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, public holidays are strictly regulated by law, so that the practice of reorganizing the working days around the holidays has now become established, but the coming year gives us fewer such days.
In the EU and in America, something else is also referred to as a holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and non-working days.
Unemployed days are usually ecclesiastical holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: Both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are work-free days - the latter alone allows New Year's Eve celebrations to rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are March 15, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, which commemorates the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August, the foundation of the state, on the 1st of May the work is celebrated, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of “workday shift” has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is ultimately to be worked out, has for many years been determined by the Minister of Labour in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Excluded are only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
This year, the working regulations are only confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in this country remains formally standing, since most take time balance for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the holiday specially cancelled for it.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week or into the end of the week, so there will be fewer re-arrangements on working days than this year.
The calendar is first "upside down" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days at a time.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second re-arrangement is related to the holiday on October 23: On Saturday, October 18, you will have to work on Friday, October 24 in advance.
However, the end of the year will be completely in the sign of the holidays, after December 24, everything will be left and stopped, even if New Year’s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things to annoy coworkers
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive - harmless lies that we no longer notice at all: they bring "color" to everyday life in the workplace.
The question is whether to get used to these little inconveniences, or to better face the challenge and try to consciously avoid these misunderstandings for other annoying situations.
-Tips.
“Sorry, I forgot to direct you that someone from the marketing department called,” says one colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make up for it again, perhaps by calling the marketing department and confessing regretfully that you forgot to align the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is dismissed with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about what you can do to give your colleagues really unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Do you borrow something that doesn’t belong to you?
There’s hardly anything more annoying than picking up a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it is gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from colleagues, because they are rightly upset when they find that something has gone away.
So, don’t put envelopes or post-it from the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more when you need it urgently.
Talking about the private life of your colleagues?
There is no effective way to stop a gossip that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with whom?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues to everyone’s nose if possible!
And if someone opens up and reveals his Inner Secret to us, we should not abuse that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a tomb instead of aligning those who are not present, even if others are aware of your colleague’s problems.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call in the office to report sick, citing painful headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: Your own work, unavoidable tasks, projects with fixed appointments must now be done by your colleagues instead of yourself.
So don’t play badly with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won’t make it to the office the next day, or that something could happen in between, so you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are confronted unexpectedly with the absence.
Sum, Smile, Phone
One is just deepened in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud yelling of the colleagues?
Are you listening to a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
One should not annoy one’s colleagues with humming, singing, loud conversations (which one has over their heads), cramping, constant insults or nagging.
All of this can be very disruptive, even if you aren’t deeply involved in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the others’ fault?
If a project is not finished on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the blame of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to confess your mistakes and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to make up for the mistake or to make up for what has been missed is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and slips: Comfortable for at home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Even then you should not dress so casually if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress appropriately in the office - if desired, also pretty and elegant!
Want to make everyone right - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning traffic jam.
A strange melody echoes from the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real jewel of sound a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar that sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not really spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the traffic jam differently when you listen to the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage skirt is back "in" with its guitar quip, the domestic electropop proves: there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, performing himself in the band Yonderboi, before he began to walk his own path - perhaps because an inn cannot tolerate two whistles.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which merges elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not achieve until the request to compose the soundtrack to a film had approached him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider public when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album in 2002 among the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only trendsetter to be marketed in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they also liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album titled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs years.
The term originates from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be fine, but in addition to the essential character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of rock'n'roll, corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends, stand out.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere at the Millenáris.
One song from the album has even made it to the radio hit - the most recent from early to late pop music broadcaster mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi has successively put the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
All right (?)
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't really mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and meaningless, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener’s willingness to listen also works according to this principle, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences of your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially to the west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music happening around them much more attentively because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
How important is it, who, where, how many of your music listen to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more come to our concerts.
We have never written for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but this in turn only exists in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to make it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He is on the road as a soloist and has rather built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, apart from the fact that we always try to interpret this into our music.
We see ourselves as team players who trust in each other’s musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" comes first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously staged with a slightly more popular style towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would be a drag horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the finale of the album, with which we wanted to dissolve the Klangorgie and the slightly more difficult themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly you, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir of talented soloists from the domestic music scene.
So the six-piece choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we later named "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same way, or did the girls co-create it?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically immediately and terrifyingly spontaneous.
I can remember that I was quite electrified at the time, but it took the "Divas" as well.
With my voice alone, the song would never have been so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on the back of the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was because of purely technical problems.
We didn’t want to give them solo roles.
In the number, it is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who came from and where you are going, we simply allow these particular wings, the wings of love, to lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none, there were more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes constantly with the concerts and also now that I have "released" the album.
"Prophet Is A Fool," "Escape From The Earth," and "Never The Same."
Fraudulent broker risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Soilless scammer
His former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
It came in for almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a great player who wanted to do it the same as his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in good time.
"He is mentally weak," was heard from the mouths of his superiors, who reported him to the police.
But according to Kerviels statements published by the French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year with his businesses.
Crisis not just in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros during the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were initial reports that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those given to low-income customers or those who had early payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel did not believe it and was right.
By the end of the year, it had increased its profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“Even when I made the first half-billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn’t keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he forged documents so as not to get caught.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Probably not.
“I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank.”
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never earn as much as others.
“Already in my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told the investigators.
But soon after his entry came the first great success.
He made a lot of money with the shares of the alliance by putting half a billion euros on price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we leave you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I made money, my eyes were closed.”
But then came the big blow at the beginning of this year.
In a single day, he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get him into the trap?
He was suspicious of a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked at in the cards,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion.
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kronor) in the coming years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the program "Enterprise and Innovation".
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Enterprise and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative businesses.
The aim is to raise finance for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new candidate countries in the acquisition of money from EU funds to date.
Nicaraguan court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former president
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud in the amount of $100 million (almost 1.8 billion kronor).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda in the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997-2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the chairman of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the detention officers whether to let Alemán sit his sentence at home, or if he has to go to prison.
A court four years ago proved that Alemán had regularly shifted government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is through
Yes, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget this government has designed and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The year was still approved with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could therefore not afford to reject it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-respected, yet highly significant law in complete tranquillity.
This is somewhat paradoxical.
All governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative issue for the media, and that is why they devote more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses in the past Social Democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditures that are legally obligatory, not only on pensions, but also on social spending, which the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M (communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits in the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to revenues from taxes, levies and bank loans, issued other sources of investment, often ill-considered bonds through which they over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the wake of privatization.
Now that source is dead.
Insofar as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a period of growth that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is constantly boasting about.
This was a unique way for their governments to get public finances in order.
Instead, however, these governments owed the state even more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly attributable to previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a gigantic extent just in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in removing some of the nonsensical populist spending that was passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is not a delay in the retirement age and a pension reform in the near future, then practically any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but a pure trustee.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that then ruling politicians become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social spending.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The planned deficit of 70 billion kroner in 2008 would be superfluous if previous governments had not spent the last ten years.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can only spend as much as it is able to collect taxes and fees as it desires rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the U.S. Fed is sending $40 billion to auction, another 24 making it loose for the European and Swiss central bank.
It is the first time since the attacks of September 11, that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinated approach to deter or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
“Central banks must have been really afraid of what could be done when they decided to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he said.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, potentially impacting economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for lending between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend to each other money, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
“This will have the same effect as a further cut in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by the central banks is helping to heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is believed to be most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the closing UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, Not a Green Planet", he stated that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which creates a strange mixture of government representatives and those of non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech president stressed that the subject matter was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often encounter caricatures of my views."
Interested people could now read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist, but in his opinion he has sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, capable of understanding and judging technical treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no concordant opinion among scientists about global warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore not a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven views on others as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he sees this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who have no regard for the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day that you can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid driving authorization will take to the streets.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive at all have not changed their driving license.
While small towns report a sharp decline in interest in front-end exchange, the offices of the capital are overwhelmed with requests, and interest in the exchange grew this week.
The City Council handles around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver’s license.
The issue of a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not manage the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license, will face a fine from January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also have it reversed with an admonition.
In the event of a violation, the penalty may be increased to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the municipality may also impose a penalty on those who do not drive at all.
He could face a penalty of up to 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 kroner.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, however, no one threatens a thousand crowns penalty.
A driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
This is not an identity card that everyone, including a valid one, must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to take him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 become invalid.
However, drivers must also gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driving licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three years left to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives allied with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of having done something in common with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years in prison, respectively.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Higher Regional Court, which reduced their sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years respectively.
Against today's verdict, there is no possibility of appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is also charged in this case, he is initially faced with a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, however, he had already received sentences of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for more.
A district court found 19 people guilty in January, mainly for involvement in robberies, the Higher Regional Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused denied the indictment from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych criminals, passed on information from police sources, covered up various robberies and helped members of the gang to escape prosecution.
The gang gave Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k 30 percent of the spoils.
The indictment is about crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
Particularly for robberies, the victims of which often suffered serious injuries, but also for intimidation and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with a steel core, a laser target telescope and a machine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns through their robbery raids.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, courts found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robberies.
Other men from Berdych’s district have to be held accountable in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought to court.
The main proceedings have so far escaped Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody and await a final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent pair.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, therefore completely disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's hearing.
“But in order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that led the opposite side to draw up.
We will see if it has any value at all.
But we insist on the view that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone together," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 kroner for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov family wanted a million crowns for every month they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for compensation negotiations was an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees and depths.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even though they faced accusations that they could have prevented the newborns from being confused.
The women, in turn, deal worse with the aftermath of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is now taking place, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermáks in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the district captain of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina (Bohemian-Mearian Height) handed over 100,000 crowns to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred to them by the mistake of the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far granted comparatively low sums of damages to those affected, the amounts were determined by tables and ranged in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka came to his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built up a team led by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not take part in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client will probably appeal.
"The dispute is about Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team wanting to participate in the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vkas parasitic," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the hearing.
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian in the words "Wales Kingdom".
The same is true of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve had almost 10 years of work behind us.
Fundraising and concepts of activities,” he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute over money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work,” he said.
lucrative business
According to the court, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka used the term "Walesian King" for the first time in one of his television shows.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
But this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came to the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity emerged, which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then joined the founding of the company "Wales Kingdom".
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports, and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> used only the mere idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka had publicized in the show "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who would have devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the parties now divided lasted until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized the official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, the disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to pile up, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I elected until Saint Nimmerlein's Day".
At the suggestion of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková took the leading role as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the competition prepared by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> for the throne and half a princess.
From this a new king should emerge.
Details and an appointment he did not yet reveal.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It was supposed to be something like the royal entourage in the Walachei.
The king was to be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also log in," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Prejudices disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a particular fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear shift, the steering and also the workmanship could be described as rather below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that is much better.
The station wagon with the name SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little headroom on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the station wagon is designed in such a way that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I only go through the interiors briefly, so as not to repeat myself too much.
It is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the careless middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a bit more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The lateral support has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
Regarding the space available, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the station wagon, the aforementioned lack of headroom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo space.
I have to call it (also because of the foldable rear window) very easy to load and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding straps, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be pulled apart and also hold heavier objects.
But let's talk about the loading volume.
According to the table, it is 428 liters in the basic equipment, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle in this class in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot is clearly left behind by 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the completely flat loading space after the rear seats have been folded over or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a displacement of 1.6 liters and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that’s what a 1600 cubic engine should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls well away.
If I compare him with his <0xC5><0xA0>koda counterpart, which sometimes looks like his exhaust is clogged with a rag, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not quite popular.
But we have to remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still continues.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beats again with 80000 kroner in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper trigger, electric window lifters at the back and and...
The total cost of the car is 531,900 kroner.
That’s a lot, but count the extra equipment of a Fabia and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
So the only thing left is the decision which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which is causing fears among the locals about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hitherto faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between the immigrants and the children of the original residents are increasing in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools aptly illustrates the case of North Kent, where clashes between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and bullying among pupils have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a 10-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself with the fact that the boy had insulted her with racist insults.
Police also had to intervene after an attack by two underage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks about the man and thrown stones at him.
“As we went home, a boy climbed on a bushy noise and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then uncovered his buttocks,” a mother of a Slovak student in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more tense.
In the UK there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, that will come true if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is calm like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an abundant extent.
Only on one island, however, you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American epoch.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, skyscrapers grew, cars drove across the wide boulevards, which were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
Cocktails can be mixed at the bar at Hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars of the fifties are still driving around in Havana today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and humid air.
Although Havana, in particular its oldest part, has fallen heavily, there is nowhere in the vicinity so many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much-needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a marotte that is unique in the world and attracts railway lovers in particular.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-driven narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you see cute and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursions
The most important places do not miss the majority of visitors to Cuba.
It is no longer necessary to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
It is worth mentioning that there is a museum in Hemingway’s property, which should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on limestone soil.
The mogotas, lime cliffs and rocks, rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities fertile soil accumulated, through which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was shot there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, heavily influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in the last four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is so remote that there was no road there in the 1950s that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to leave it unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing torn down, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Valley of Sugar Factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which revives after dark, and where the music does not remain silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo to it have to overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through a landscape hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern outpost of Cuba was included by UNESCO in its World Heritage list thanks to its untouched nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the trips of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle stands, the present Hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the bay of pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, you could write many pages about all this.
But, as they say, it is better to look at it with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and a lack of necessary equipment are influencing the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not proceed according to their ideas, on which were agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have deployed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and intensifying development assistance.
“In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is enabling residents to start developing the economy and security themselves,” Des Browne, Britain’s defense minister, told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the US Army.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them,” Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop said today.
“I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been a dispute among the participating countries over whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy fur.
"Afghan nonsense unmasked: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the Sun wrote in a post, supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went on to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government Debt Will Rise to One Billion in 2009
Each Czech citizen owes a national debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to CHF 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to indebt itself this year with 159.2 billion cones.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on national debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech Republic owes a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state has owed more than 111 billion kroner.
“Until now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be able to exceed the limit of one trillion kroner until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, sees it: “We could get over one trillion in the course of 2009.
When exactly depends on the next budget, which we do not know yet.
If it turns out that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I do not expect such a change,” he remarked.
Debt grows
The public debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by treasury orders, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds of the European Investment Bank.
National debt rose to CHF 719.4 billion this year.
The foreign debt of the state has now risen by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
Total debt rose 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth can be seen especially in the bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debts are rising, but on the other hand, it shows that something can be done even before the pension reform comes,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of public debt for 2007 shows that the government had planned to receive 159.2 billion kroner for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the better development of state budgetary policy.
This is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion kroner this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion kroner.
In addition, the maximum planned appropriations for the Consolidation Agency amount to 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve to pay the pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and loans to the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan of insulting Islam, was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old pupils to name a teddy bear Muhammad, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She deserved to be flogged.
After parents of pupils complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher, who worked at Khartoum’s Unity High School, was taken home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to pick a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school principal Robert Boules.
Finally, as the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a given name very common in Sudan.
Subsequently, the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear himself did not carry a shield with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that would have brought her close to a religious faith, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion this is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by numerous students of the teacher, who describe it as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This given name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of devotion to the prophet (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, no agreement was reached at the last negotiating session in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies over the future status of the separatist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasising that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner called on Belgrade and Pristina to comply with their commitments to maintain peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, indicating that there are quite clear tensions.
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ishinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika last August had received the order for a new mediation from the UN.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on December 10.
The Russians, who had already blocked the granting of Kosovo’s independence to the Security Council, insisted on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia has been and remains an advocate for a negotiated solution, a consensual solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision to be the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to unilaterally announce them if the Security Council does not decide in their favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of Kosovo’s autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations of the last chance have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise was always to be sought, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that there is a “domino effect” in a region that has been weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the final say
Only a decision from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end up as they began: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu told reporters that Kosovo’s parliament would have the final say on the status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking population would take place in consultation with Western countries.
Bush unleashes agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was convened under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them sign a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must cease its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas ultimately aim at a peace treaty that will clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation encompasses the three serious problems that the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians revolve mainly around: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in what is now the state of Israel as a result of the 1948 conflict.
According to the American president, Abbas took the floor, insisting that the coming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he pledged that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would make an effort to bring them to an end before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which exist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance in this sense from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
“Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has initiated a plan adopted by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arabian prince says in his interview with the Saudi-funded Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 pm, a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no mission, but was on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a spokesman for the police said.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without registration, i.e. not approved for public transport (see below), came, controlled by two teenagers without a helmet, approached at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it disregarded its right-hand driveway, a policeman said.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (crumpled fender, splintered windshield, torn bumper) testifies to the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of involuntary killings and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in consultation with the main public safety department of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excludes the responsibility of the police officers to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, who were heard Sunday night, have confirmed the police’s version, namely that this small motorbike has reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of groove, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hooked to each other until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical review.
The bodies of the two victims were obducted yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel there was a rumor that the police had left the accident site very quickly, without helping the two young men.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious mistakes in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, for which further investigation is necessary, and in which it is necessary to proceed very carefully .
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, says this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman lying down.
Two more tried to revive one of the youths, the fourth on the phone.
Given the tension that had quickly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken in the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescuers arrived about twenty minutes after the policemen left.
They have also used cardiac massages, but in vain.
I will not allow any claim to be made that the police forces did not help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The fire brigade arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tensions are rising
On Monday, Pakistani police crushed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared an emergency two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken within the framework of the emergency were injured by tear gas grenades deployed by law enforcement forces there.
They then threw stones with which they wounded the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition activists, human rights defenders and lawyers over the weekend.
Monday morning, the roads leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (north-east).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the emergency, and to those who took an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
In the days that followed, he had to comment on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct vote on October 6.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced.
“Everything we represent is illegal, unconstitutional, and contrary to Supreme Court decisions,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s pledge to take command of the army and become a civilian president has not been valid since the emergency was called, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to surrender his military uniform by November 15, when his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed by January.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the institute, which finds that the percentage of women between the ages of 20 and 40 who use the pill has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, however, the liberalization of contraception has enabled better fertility control.
Today, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
With one out of five couples even accurately calculated on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the time of year when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the International Space Station (ISS) crew will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit, which has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools crafted by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon house the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew’s second task was to implement a 17.5-tonne solar panel power generation module that was already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to restructure the solar panels of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded up like accordions was damaged by a jammed cable over a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped so as not to further damage the collector.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to leave the space shuttle Discovery and then repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skillful, it has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was chosen to operate on the injured solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and attached a kind of rail to the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric shock on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, the astronauts aboard the station had devised and crafted.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation, before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to presumably make the return flight to Earth Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned on the stock market
After announcing that the aviation and defense group will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the residues of the A400M, EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its 2007 business forecasts once again, referring to the debris caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine, which delayed the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month backlog.
As a reminder, EADS's business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the delay of another programme, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
The Group had originally planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the ballot boxes: the mass of Russians will choose President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, it confirms its quest for stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message broadcast on public channels to voters, which has already been recorded, but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, for which an overwhelming victory is predicted.
Yesterday, when he received the foreign ambassadors, the president did not give a glimpse, and was content to deliver a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost their way.
She denounces a campaign stained by oppression.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such a dirty election, not even in the Yeltsin period.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for illicit demonstrations, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these unrelenting parliamentary elections, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
- Prime Minister?
President of the parliamentary majority and of the almighty United Russia Party, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Levada Center.
The historian Nikolai Koposov of the St. Petersburg State University goes even further back: civil society has only developed very slowly in this country, which was Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of community has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again attached to the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism did not follow terrorism, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility that they have briefly put into practice after the collapse of the USSR.
What do you think about for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think about it for a long time?
Those in power aren’t so bad, why are they replacing?
A heavy memory
After being treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed over a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and by name, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states responsible for its administration – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to conduct research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced labourers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, which are managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICCR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal inquiries.
Nevertheless, a part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing fundamentally new can be expected in these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s most important trading partner, accounting for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of India’s foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros and services worth 10 billion euros annually to Barros, said this week European President Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regrets that the reciprocal trade has not yet met with the President of Delhi and the Prime Minister of India.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern, offering 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the ongoing worry over lending conditions, announcing a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at a base rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusually long-term offer.
To alleviate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly difficult at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they should organise their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of their savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open-market notification for five weeks.
The Bank further explains that in this way, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be in circulation on December 6 at 12.15 GMT, at the basic tax rate and only until January 10.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE has been circulating liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the day-to-day different interest rates of the inter-bank loans with its basic interest rate.
The inter-bank interest rate, which differs from day to day, was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has slipped to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalties that had prevented banks from using them.
According to some rumors, intensified by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to a rejection of the text.
The text created during a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, the majority of which 50% for the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP flotante, a transport check or the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against examining the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which led to some fierce exchanges of words between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the whole of their proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a role model for the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival will probably take place from August 8th to 10th on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the management of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever been to, says his company and that of Melvin Benn are working alongside each other to provide the area with a European-style festival event.
“We have selected Philadelphia as a market and are eager to work with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
We were negotiating with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates about the current administration,” continues Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents brought the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival back to life at Grand Park Chicago after profiling itself in the festival world in 2002 along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues in 2007 respectively.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more of an urban green space,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is to somehow merge these two concepts together to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival in the European and an urban one in the American way.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, is taking the burden of this event with joy,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to host a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners with C3, which won the Top Independent Promoter Award at the last Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood movies to Montreal if no less than the Terminator is opposed.
These enticement attempts are part of the delegate tasks.
A politically "heic mandate" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the “Governor”?
“You have to be careful, because it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the local cinema is at the moment a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At every festival on the West Coast, though Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure the producers are giving interviews.
The Dark Ages had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock market ahead of a final year rally? Expert disagreement due to the US mortgage crisis
With just under five weeks until the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already rubbing their hands with a view to the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make reliable forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically speaking, the month of December on the stock market is usually associated with a positive market development.
Nonetheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions determine the current market developments.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the final weeks of the year, they note that the stock market price is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, who invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of safe equity funds, which is strongly affected by the upward trend towards profitable assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock market will have a rather lateral price trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially since we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the Fed’s interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of the rise in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of BPI’s sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a bold time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on November 8 of 15,945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully end the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grants made each year around this time.
Nevertheless, the expert points out that this year things could be going a little differently, mainly due to the end-year rally taking place in the second week of December, and thus directly after Bridge Day to Constitution Day.
In the analyst’s view, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Bank Inversis, previous assessments of the market situation are at a near-technical level, which could result in a deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of the values that will push the Ibex to new heights.
Solana of Intermoney says that this year the big values are the turn.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been catching up in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, according to the expert.
Regarding the increased consumption behavior during the Christmas days, periodic consumption will determine the market in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in small numbers in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has seen only two declines.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock market out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December saw a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its stores.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular is the first group of banks to dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays until 8.30 pm and start on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly read about the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The bank’s ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement whereby 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the clientele.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to opening hours, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that Popular is pursuing with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the customer base of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is combined with a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colorful design.
Responsible bank representative <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment of staff, as a branch no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, according to <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a branches have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
The BBVA model is not used in these PopularMax stores, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
“We don’t want to compete for our customers,” Rivero explains.
With Telefonica, they have temporarily reached an agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco is doubling its stock market value for the first time, overtaking its rival Antena 3.
We've made it.
With this sentence, the CEO of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the close of the stock market. The broadcaster led by him had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too low.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the value of the company now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%) and Vocento holding only 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, bringing its market value to 2,193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, at Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) to 2,518.53 million and at Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies, Vasile said.
The question remains to what extent we can actually act on the stock market, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
A week ago, Telecinco announced its plan to become the first television channel this year with more than 1,000 million gross earnings from advertising revenues, said Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business was only up 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s comparatively better stock market performance is the high payout ratio that the company has had up to now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a led to a 100 percent dividend distribution.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as its parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always stated significantly more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by the purchase of 33% of Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market currently has certain loss tendencies.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decline from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This has also reduced Antena 3’s expected profit calculation for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1 .
Ibersecurities: relies on its high yield and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buy) measures a more advantageous position than Antena 3 (hold) due to the multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
3.
JPMorgan: recommends resetting expectations in both cases given similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress agrees to the MIFID directive, which came into force on November 1.
Parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the decision of Congress in the Senate on the amendments/additions associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the congressmen and senators, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the objective of establishing the best possible regulation that ensures the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market operation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIFID, which re-establishes the Securities Services Regulation, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control entitlement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive makes it possible to offer financial advice to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services firms (ESIS), the advisory firms that partner with investment and brokerage firms.
In addition, it expands the number of financial transaction execution systems, adding to the regulated circulation markets the multilateral systems of effect trading and the systems for the internationalization of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic players.
The law obliges investment firms to disclose the focal points of their corporate profile, the confrontation and ways of dealing with risks in the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congressional Economic Commission foresees further changes in hindsight, with the decision that the securities bond must now be considered complex financial resources for the investor due to its high level of risk, confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of graduate economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation was adopted restricting the working areas reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on behalf of others, does not need authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialization of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time to several investment companies.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose five-tenths in November to 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of US products by disclosing the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be made prematurely by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) cautioned that the pre-established indicator only serves as a guideline and therefore does not have to be in line with the final result that will be announced on 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the CPI in November was a temporary development; at the same time, he assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good, Spain’s inflation difference to the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin expects Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The stocks of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half after the bank asked the British central bank for an emergency loan in mid-September last year, and they are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to a record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably in two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group under the Virgin Money brand after the acquisition, will have to make up about a quarter of the UK banks’ income from the investments over the next three years to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to reach their target of 30 billion pounds.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (equivalent to approximately €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested on suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of Totano (Partido Popular), part of the municipality of Murcia, this morning, on the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption, which was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretary of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
Last May, José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo represented Juan Morales, currently a member of the Partido Popular and then chairman of the municipal council of Totana, and could be the original co-creator of the plot, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged, MP Juan Morales was arrested while leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents alleged to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged payments Morales made to a Galician construction company, which planned the conclusion of an urban construction contract in which the development of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to head the list of PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory for the Socialists, to assume the office of President of the Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, PSOE secretary of organisation, and Bono in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place today at the party headquarters.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha-born politician would apparently run for president of the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of Congress, who announced on November 15 that he would no longer run in the next general election, end his career in public policy and instead advocate for climate protection in the university sector.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president of the government had continuously pushed for his return to political action.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party, as with the appointment of the Vice President of Economy, did not want to deprive citizens of who in the event of an election victory would assume the post of President of Congress, calling this an act of transparency.
If he should actually assume the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or cry, so as to make it seem more and more like the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time one gets the impression that the only place in Madrid where one cannot talk quietly and serenely is the Congress; so the President of the Government has been interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n and his good work, indicating that he did not want to create the appearance of having already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is relentlessly critical of both climate change sceptics and those who put a social and political debate in the foreground, the movement as a whole must bring about strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of Prime Minister Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in need of explanation regarding the action, or non-action, of his government, which has decisively contributed to Spain being at the top of the countries within the EU that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for non-compliance, to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which proposed the contract with the planet, did not stop this development.
In addition, he is now forced to explain to the Spanish citizens the measures he envisaged against climate change without detour.
Which companies will be affected, which behavior of the citizens should be changed, which individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences result from it.
More specifically, who will have to sacrifice themselves and pay for saving the planet.
However, there are and will be no such statements in the future.
It’s because it’s about giving up and paying.
Because the measures that can be used against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so dangerous in terms of election strategy that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, minutes and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise so suitable for election campaigns does not have to speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and accordingly does not imply that the bicycle will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to an alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Totana, the popular politician José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, as well as the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel owner on suspicion of urban planning violations.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is to this day, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the search already last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it was found that more than 2 million hectares of undeveloped land for urban construction projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria were illegally to be remodeled. This was to build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration arrived during the last Legi.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation initiated and conducted by the first Totonas court.
The first six people arrested have been brought before the judge today.
According to investigators, the investigation is also against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend, residing in Murcia, are under suspicion.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, Manuel N.A., a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is said to have acted as a subgroup of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban delicts, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out eleven more searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies that were directly related to those held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farm, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the town of Murcia, which was to include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometers of land in Totana, which needed to be rebuilt, with the aim of realizing a construction project that would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the car parks of the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specialized in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the commentary published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the commentary published in the same newspaper on November 18th; coincidentally on the day whose edition contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy surrounding Jokela's school.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a high school graduate who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical stance towards Plato and suggested that Plato’s teaching from the lower-level curriculum for philosophy at high schools be deleted.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be punishable by six months in prison.
However, if you again rob a music business worth less than 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is considered a criminal offence, but the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it back forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious conflict entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the exchange of data results in a deprivation of liberty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less harmful than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyrighted films that have not been authorized by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague is right, then someone has quite screwed up his demands.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research papers entitled: Money leads to activation of certain areas of the brain, especially when others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings generated by the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest issue of the science journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers could see that brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their response and therefore received the same level; but if one of them received twice as much, it also resulted in stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure if it actually takes so much scientific effort to reach such a result.
Prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been searching relentlessly for the criminals of the Balkan Wars for eight years. Her official seat is in the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and a laughing eye, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed – namely former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain on the loose.
Their names are on a list, which Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach uses as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, follows Swiss prosecutors from Belgrade to New York in their endeavors to track down the escaped criminals and pressure their respective governments.
Which insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up of the driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance policyholder.
This agreement is entered into in writing by means of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit the corresponding amount of compensation in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance, which is composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of issue of the driver's license, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
The insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that if there is a higher risk of accident, higher contribution payments will also be due.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since according to the statistical values and accordingly also according to the conviction of the companies, they tend to fewer accidents than single persons.
The benefit attributed to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that most likely meets his personal needs.
We now list the most important points that one should consider when choosing an insurance in order to make not only a performance- but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under 25 years of age face numerous obstacles when choosing a low-cost insurance, such as low driving practice and a young driver’s license.
Even if it would be best for ideal insurance coverage to take out full insurance, there are nonetheless cheaper alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full insurance with a deductible, so that while the benefits of a full insurance are covered, they are offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay part of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, main representative of Spain at First Europa, an online insurance brokerage company.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against damage to their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you are under the age of 25, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs, thus increasing your credit by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction of the basic rate with the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a profitable year behind it, it can afford to increase bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract, which is due to the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Therefore, it is most sensible to opt for full insurance with self-equity.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish head of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second practice year after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the corresponding person also allows.
On the part of the insurers, married couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and accordingly, their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, the best option would be a full insurance with a deductible (with an amount of around 300 euros). In the event that you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which starts only for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to set up a higher contribution payment, notes Luis Noguera.
For retirees, it is advisable to take out a full insurance with self-eligibility (at an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance, which only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidental damage, but also because it carries high costs, which require a thorough selection to be made that corresponds to our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the point for the final of the eighth in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting in San Siro next Tuesday for the missing point to reach their respective goals before the end of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while the latter decides on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs one more to ensure that FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D matches will take place one week before the end of the sixth round as FC Milan must compete at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the semi-final on the 13th, to enter the final on the 16th.
So this group will be finished before all the others and the tie at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltic Glasgow knows that if they win, they would be group first and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be defeated in a knockout of Shakhtar FC, but they should not rely too much on such circumstances, because with nine points equal, the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they could win in the second game (2-0).
They hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after being defeated in the same round in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the post-match time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw in the first leg.
As FC Shakhtar waits for the Rossoneri to win, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both reaching the round of 16 and UEFA membership will depend on their victory and defeat by Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of their lower standings and without the prospect of continuing to compete in the biggest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus play for UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators after the band's dissolution in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the mood was excellently reunited in the band.
Around 20,000 people were able to witness the concert in the sold-out stadium, where a video of the history of the band, which had caused furore in the late 1990s, was shown.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, and which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which they had previously been given by Posh Spice’s husband, English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds that made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for Schow, Victoria Beckham announced that the British star has not seen our wardrobe once, and so I am very excited about what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed their nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought, why not, so I’m glad I made that decision,” Chisholm said of the band’s separation nine years ago.
The singer also reported that the disputes were resolved and now everyone is very happy.
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls’ last joint appearance in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special Virgin Airlines machine, according to a report by CTV.
Upon arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of nannies.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will next perform in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears over natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute looms between Ukraine and Russia, raising the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe being impaired.
The bulk of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is conducted through Ukraine and any dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced supplies to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is taking place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additionally for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in talks,” Ukraine’s economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] over Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a fall in exports to Western Europe, which drove prices up dramatically.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS 'must control foreign workers'
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the checks of the criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought together in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish state health service has no precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated personnel recruited outside the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road vehicle drove through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared on video at the Old Bailey in October and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks prior to the hiring of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the UK.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the agency does not have the authority to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The report of the chief auditor now states, among other recommendations, that the board should take up guidelines of the criminal record excerpt, which helps employers with checks in different countries.
"Although we found evidence of these checks in some personnel records, they were not routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigative guidelines heavily prior to hiring, but added: “Our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health service employees is available.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “extremely unlikely” that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks in advance of hiring potential NHS employees.
“The report says that the NHS Scotland’s current pre-employment tests are working well and it’s not clear what added value the recommendations will provide,” he said.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards have problems identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation further found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian have been predominantly followed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification controls.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign staff in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was concerned to do this work in the face of the terror attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines on pre-employment screenings by all employees, including those from abroad, scheduled to be released next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards ceremony
Control, the biography of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five British Independent Film Festival awards, including Best Picture.
Awards were also given to leading actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before casting for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and supporting actor Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress in the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world.
The prizes were presented in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at age 23.
The black and white film, which features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, best known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, for best director and best director debut.
Rock music was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor Award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-based Easter Promises thriller.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named after Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my type of person, a great actor of his time, I’m truly honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for plot of terror
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that had planned an impending attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle in rockets.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect facilities following a failed al-Qaida attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a statement by the interior minister, says 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell headed by a “missile expert” who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees were said to have planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis seeking Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias seeking to fight the Allied forces and the U.S.-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is seen by the Hardliners among Sunni Saudis as heretical.
Al Qaeda militias see many clerics in Saudi Arabia as collaborating with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and facilities of the energy sector.
"This has been a very large effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman for the interior ministry told state television.
The arrests also concerned a “media cell” of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote “Takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims branded as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militias.
The climate on Venus could give us a glimpse of the Earth’s future
Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft show that the planet is even more like a remote twin from Earth than previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions would have prevailed on Venus that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been habitable, scientists believe today.
But because of the unrestrained carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight and a slower rotational speed, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-heavy winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the plant for a year, offer a sobering glimpse of how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar.”
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with a habitable environment.”
‘Enriched Uranium’ Confiscated by Police
One kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately agreed to engage in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and submit them to send to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which is breaking into the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with selecting the YouTube clips to be shown to the prospective candidate.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
This is one of the most important issues for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates spoke strictly across borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed ahead in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he was relentless about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney by accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
The two argued particularly strongly as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegals a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the two men has any serious chances of nominating, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they’ve cracked the immigration squeeze earlier and harder than others.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates broadly share the same views: tighter borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help Republicans forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were brought to the fore.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee — now in first place contrary to all expectations in a recent poll conducted in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism — said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pushed on whether Jesus would endorse them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa falls along with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have been shot up out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the outset and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered yet another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No titles of nobility seem sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the revelation that a wealthy businessman has veiled donations to the British ruling Labour Party over more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the contested Gordon Brown would have done well.
When, two months ago, the prime minister withdrew from the demand for an election, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp-minded leader of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once dreaded Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskillful rescue of Northern Rock, a battered bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have provoked corporate associations against the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by tax authorities revealed unimaginable administrative looting.
A trio of retired generals launched an uprising in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being minister of the armed forces, they claimed, was a part-time job.
Now there are the manifold donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s general secretary (and its former fulfillment manager) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown irrevocably breaks off toward resignation.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
People may not trust or trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is starting to leak; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-chief.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax jurisdiction records, for example, are related to decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Department of Finance.
And even if he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s misfortune — as in the long “money for nobility” investigation of political party funding — voters may assume he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't quite as bad as it looks.
The misdeeds are not as terrible as the Conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely sneaked.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new uproar of political donations is a good example.
Abraham’s garboeske, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
That may be the case, but the decision was not for him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for one clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham’s agreement, but not that it was illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s main financier, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But so far, Brown has not been involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these confusions, even though most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted that determination by grasping a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - led to the full measure of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "lessons to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a matter for the police.
Other than that, there are other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding something like a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been vacant for six months, and moving forward with a sweeping reform of political party funding.
That would require the hardliners of Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party colleague like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have clear leadership in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve victory is through indisputable righteousness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis hitting America’s credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural for back fins to swirl around excitedly.
Now that America’s real estate market is insulting, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of contagion from underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both depreciation and depreciation rates, which measure the proportion of loans that cannot be withdrawn or are late for more than 30 days.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its U.S. consumer finances, partly because of the weakness of credit card borrowers.
It is too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter default rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in instalments can in part be explained by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt fall in bankruptcy filings, which in turn accounted for a large part of the loss of kedit cards; the number of filings (and thus fees) would rise again whether or not the general conditions for borrowers were deteriorating.
Industry also reports solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that spending volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: consumers are more likely to take credit card debt, now that home loans are drying up.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the borrower’s creditworthiness.
They can even be beneficial for card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important among repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of the assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess the loans altogether,” said Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained downturn are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit cut push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grimmer future.
Keep an eye out for these shark fins.
British Bankers Confess Guilty in Enron Case
Three British bankers due to face trial for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their applications to guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of telecommunications fraud for allegedly conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The proceedings were scheduled for January.
But during a court hearing before U.S. District Attorney Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty to a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against her in 2002 alerted Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to fabricate a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron schemes that helped tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its stake in the subsidiary to be zero, but the three British men knew that it was actually significant in value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others paid about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two counts to conspiracy for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow was sentenced to six years in prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on a $1 million bail deposit that required them to live in the United States awaiting trial.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh-largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up billions of dollars in debt or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is sentenced to more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were void after he died of heart disease last year.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is small money for some of the rich Russians.
“It can accommodate up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you ask for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires’ Exhibition, a four-day orgy of consumption showcased in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly-earned Russians in everything from mahogany-paneled yachts to diamond-coated car grills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next trade fair stand.
“This is a nice car, but it’s cash compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Fueled by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas did at its peak.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went in droves to Europe where they were seen as materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerge as the most visible free-handed money issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who own a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes’ list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which together are worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian retailer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-groomed and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they walk through the halls Sunday night in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, label themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I’m trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for several hours to visit a congested warehouse, which shamelessly presented Cadillac Escalades, platinum pocket knife, Mövenpick ice cream, customised billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper climbers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not market themselves at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, drove through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn-in gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company had sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer requirements, said he would have sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which resemble interconnected chain bracelets, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a replacement of four.
“The Russian millionaire who wants to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of his wife’s face made of cubic zirconium is not necessarily going to ride on those wheels,” Mr. Karapetian said.
“He’ll keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian Millionaires” would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local property prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend they were rich at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four British-style red phone cells that were stuffed with mountains of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said its employees had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the piles of money, taking mobile phone photos as they leaned back in the middle of the spare wealth, getting kicked by friends, or just plugging in a few million.
“You see, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire,” Mr. Karryev said.
Confused operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched an ambulance stop at the white Cape Cod two doors further down West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's body viewer's box car coming in," Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, said Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The authorities learned that the dead woman, Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon who police did not identify and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help uncover a mysterious death that has sent mourning from the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to Police Director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hard-working and persistent,” Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
“She was my pit bull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Ms. Walsh said.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have made little known about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Ms. Castro’s house, where a withered rose bush stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable, helping him navigate the provincial and harsh political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing.”
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to a rise in global equity markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm credit markets through further interest rate cuts were bolstered by soothing comments from the U.S. central bank’s deputy chairman.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the central bank’s chairman, said policy must respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm annoying markets, in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turmoil had “partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October.”
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilize lending conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate cuts.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street in the face of further bad news from the U.S. economy, now that U.S. property sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that it will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to offset heavy losses from its lost bets in the U.S. mortgage lending sector.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Commercial Banks was lent at a considerable 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow suit and feed more capital into the money markets in London rose as credit tensions saw the three-month “libor” rates for lending between UK banks rise to their highest since late September, following a continuous increase since November 21.
England Faces Decision on Statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who is going to beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the Electoral Chairman, on call at least under this special title, is here to help Chief Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, gradually fills with applications for national electoral boards, if not for those on a part-time basis.
Whoever does not get the sixth racket position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and the sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to pin down exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his or her career, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not just in cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to climb Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
Perhaps the same can be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decisions, but chances have the same.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a racket must get regular chances on order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better off last season than, for example, James Anderson, who appears to be playing in the first test, even though Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind blows into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-notch wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of opinion.
The choice might decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, then still struggling to solidify himself, who made the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, despite scoring a double-hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in the course of today’s networking session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and gut feeling for Shah’s greater experience of Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six from Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and an excellent balance against twisted bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two May innings against West Indies in testing in Lord, his home arena as a Middlesex player, and this, plus his immediate rejection by the picks when Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum out of his beating that was still evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a joie de vivre.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket pitch and his attitude away from it was brought to the point when he had recently overtaken a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and enthusiastically say, “Did you see that?”.
Bopara is a much better field player, he throttles his middle pace with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time another.
Perhaps this is the real art of choice.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be doing well if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he is the one to play here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and Fight Al-Qaida
The first bus shipments of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced people whose funds or visas have expired, and others hoping that the city will return to normalcy.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan returning by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to put his forces back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he was unable to renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local, U.S.-backed militia helped drive al-Qaeda out of its bastion west of the capital and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenade attack after calling on his fellow citizens to fight al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I returned today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they had been lured by the increasing calm in the capital since the US troop increase and the growth of local “groups affected citizens” who are armed and defending their neighborhoods in cooperation with the US military.
But more talked about being forced home by visa problems and running out of funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on the refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country’s sectarian death squads.
“We were doing well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis to stop giving visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retiree said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, resulting in the creation of many places where tensions have subsided.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is the leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saar countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to a non-Saarlander that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest state self-ironically for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is ranked fifth in the Education Monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
In this way, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
The proportion of foreign students is correspondingly high at 15.6 percent.
However, the Saarland also brings an above-average number of children to higher education institutions – many of them without a degree from high school.
"In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an education expert at the IW.
More than one in five young people earn their degree at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also comparatively extensive.
Based on the population, dual degree programs are the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in general education schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last year of day care is free of charge - a model that other federal states have copied in the meantime.
Whether the performance of students will improve sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the share of risk students dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better off.
And to the dismay of the Saar countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise score.
Because the language of the neighbors is obligatory at high schools - even if the Saarland countries are not French.
Chávez is changing the clocks.
In Venezuela, clocks will be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez has the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, the clocks are set to world time minus four and a half hours, according to a new law.
This gives the South American state a time zone that there is no other country in the world.
Chavez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States had imposed the division into time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair the severance of relations with the neighboring country Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which involved the release of hostages, triggered the dispute.
Uribe had “spucked Venezuela in the face” with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chavez is also on everyone’s lips in Spain.
A new cell phone ringtone is causing a stir in the country: "Why no te callas" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken to by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-America summit had been annoyed by the constant interrogations of the left-wing populist and had spoken to him.
Germans Threatened with Wage Minus in 2007
Despite the strong economy, German workers are facing a real wage loss this year, according to a forecast.
Experts cited a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could expect in 2007 real to have less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"We are to blame for the modest wage development, the VAT increase and the price surges in food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild-Zeitung.
New burdens could also be imposed on workers in terms of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products drove the inflation rate to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the hellish twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere on Earth, Venus is more similar than previously thought: The European spacecraft "Venus Express" has detected lightning in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now, the European probe Venus Express has provided the proof - it sensed electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine Nature.
According to the famous "original soup theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there ever was life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
"Venus may be Earth's devil's twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, has undergone such an entirely different evolution is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s no spacecraft has been dedicated to the exploration of this planet.
The latest research findings, which are now presented in several “Nature” articles, not only underscore the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, the researchers believe.
"They also show that our neighboring planet's similarities with Earth are greater than initially thought," the ESA said.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud swirl at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the winter hemisphere, writes a research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is nearly as large with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, orbits the sun in just under 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a day of Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus’ surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar are hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost to space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and has called on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in protection from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
“The Chancellor has not departed from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly revealed displeasure over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, of the Union's "showroom policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only unloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to information from SPIEGEL also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he was trying to secede Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots as in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not lead to violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, rioters fired shotguns at the police: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We have to make sure that we do not build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "New Press" in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federal, state and local authorities were already working hard to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, this is already showing first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
At the same time Schäuble pointed out that in German suburbs there are not urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in heavy street battles with the police over the past few nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
More integration efforts of the federal government, however, demanded the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the riots in France, Kolat warned of "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bad as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migrant background under the age of 25 is "above average".
Above all, more training places must be provided.
Kolat stressed: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The president of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany there is more than in France "a social control in the families".
Many young people with a migrant background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, "But we still have to be careful."
“Young people must be given the opportunity to participate quickly in work and education.”
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police personnel were on duty, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
Competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the previous day, an ensemble of around 1000 security forces has been providing peace of mind.
Police will take action as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the riots seized Toulouse.
The riots were inflamed in a traffic accident in which two young people were killed on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor’s unrealistic appearance documents that the coalition is at an end in terms of content – and that nothing is to be expected of herself.
In what country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her bleak appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was rooted and lacking in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should finally be ruled by her.
The accusation that it focuses too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an arguably arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, only to show that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for all recognizable how much their accusation is true.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Cloud presented herself: a prominent politician who flees into foreign policy and even stays there in the approximate.
Example of climate protection: Since she praises unrestrained for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
In any case, the self-praise - so much immodestness - the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the flakes that the upswing is coming in the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of talking nicely to the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a fringe phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low earners?
She has a few extras left for it.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to the child surcharge.
Merkel needs three moves to bring out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are in a hard swing - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already discharged at the first topic.
He has made New York a “refuge for illegal immigrants,” Mitt Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He countered with serious accusations: “I would say his own house was a port for illegals,” Giuliani replies, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of having privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates blast into attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-drawn 30-second videos that internet users have submitted via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Also Romney gets vigorously read the Levites by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond the war in Iraq and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause erupts in the auditorium.
It shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explained, apologizing to base and television audiences that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets caught up when he is asked in his opinion about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled in civilians for the first time
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani leader Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ended eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for another five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus bowing to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his inauguration, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another demand of the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied with lawyers weighed by him after the imposition of the state of emergency in early November, had dismissed all objections last week to the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy and four others wounded.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Herb Rock Return
Germany’s supergroup of the Seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival is a recording from her great time "Live 1974".
Already at that time they were much more famous abroad.
The well-planned sensation then takes place in the form of three seated gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a blossom-white shirt at 63 years old.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
To the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia music again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Targeted inquiries revealed that while the name swirled through the collective pop memory, it was by no means so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock was always more important in England and America than in one’s own country.
When the music industry bestowed the Echo Prize on the survivors of the Cologne-based group Can in 2003 for their life’s work, people were seen in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts, Michael Rother later squatted on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this time also developed a much less effective power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
At first they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, the most radical German group at the time.
Around 1973, Rother followed the cluster musician into exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as urban communal refugees.
Less ideological than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
Rather than being a bit of an artist.
It is said that there was also a wimpel of the singing association Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them Harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
As quiet and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice was not only for self-discovery.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record set of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother came at that time the desire to force Harmony and practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berliner Haus der Kulturen der Welt.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of the herbal rock on the subsequent pop music.
The blank of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s words, “The only true music, you own the future.”
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
Projections of further black-and-white photos of wired equipment are used for the creation of legends.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and drums to elicit unheard-of sounds from the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in-depth technicians.
The choir of the house doesn’t change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, she coughed and whispered under sound clouds and sang "Aaaaaaah!" in a beautiful place with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (Kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "68!" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia cannot be brought to rest even now.
Even the most self-evident is thoroughly reconsidered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of your nerves or give you great happiness in fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Murderful Peace" are again two films dealing with the Balkan War.
But they both do not convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and tangles or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can’t help in “The Hunting Party.”
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties recently, because too many nice-minded roles in feel-good movies for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism expelled one’s desire to look forward to.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the Hunter Becomes a Hunted" (why do movie titles always have to be as long and messy as locomotive driver tariffs?) perhaps.
In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become if the fate and the film industry were not so merciful: a man who has long passed his best times, but who has preserved considerable remnants of the former charm even as a ruin-like monument to his demise.
But despite this trump, “The Hunting Party” together with the German production “Morderlicher Frieden”, which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
"Murderful Peace" is a short film about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from Kosovo snipers, whereupon one quickly falls in love with her.
Although it is welcome that here once the Serbs are not portrayed as the sole root of all evil, the television-flat film too quickly loses itself in ballerinas and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" is an example of why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters setting out to track down the Serbian war criminal "The Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are strikingly similar: Both times small teams go to the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it will be a trip insane.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the run-down cynic with a heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunting Party" finally goes down the drain when the reporters succeed in the time-lapse procedure within the last five minutes in what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not achieved in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one wants to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the cinematics.
The film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they are supposed to agree exceptionally) not to pursue the persecution because of secret political collusion.
But the common good and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionately I see the swollen foreheads, suggesting: how exhausting it is to be evil".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkan War film.
Recently it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraqi films were Hollywood’s big flops.
There has never been a good South African film.
Almost always the case: when a star roams the world's hotbeds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" which are now considered classics have by no means been unanimously celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder comes home in real time on equal two screens, even just too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs screenwriters of the recklessness it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or not being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcasticly distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Major cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust reaps criticism for Olympic rejection
The mayor’s departure from Hamburg’s bid for the Summer Olympics has come under heavy criticism from politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the water games.
But von Beust urges realism in assessing the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described a resignation as "not good for the business location".
No other project in recent times has developed such motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, the momentum in sports policy could not be maintained to the same extent.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "which emanates from a changed timeline."
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on an Olympic bid, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s decision to apply Munich for the 2018 Winter Games, which is expected to take place in early December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have a realistic chance in the period we have envisaged until 2028."
However, the dream is not dreamed out for all time, said von Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to take a chance by burying the plans already at this point," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction to the statement of the Senate Chief on the occasion of a reception at the General Assembly of the General German Higher Education Sports Association.
Beust described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as an applicant city last week.
The SPD citizenry group accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put on the map of Olympia and has excluded housing,” said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for the Olympia and a later residential use for the Little Grasbrook, the CDU has unilaterally set to the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had sparked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently in Sweden made wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
The majority of the ninety-four Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968, internal investigations at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now come to a sobering result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has given to the Moderna Museum in Stockholm in 1995, are also well-deserved by the copy of the "One"
Prehistory is intertwined, a confusing intertwining of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 exhibited - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of cardboard Brillo boxes: these did not come (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cardboard Factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably gave permission in 1968 to have a few Brillo wooden crates produced in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which at that time were rightly entered into art and auction history as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have made more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later erroneously claimed that around one hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, it was not until 1990 that Hultén’s 105 boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, has investigated, in addition to the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, three of which were privately owned by Sweden, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press chipboards were first primed and thawed, after which white oil paint was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roller without primer - in addition, it is not oil paint, but acrylic paint.
“These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol’s Brillo boxes,” says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: “Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York comes to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will release the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibitions.”
In July, however, the Authentication Board announced that it would pursue the “serious accusations” raised in the matter of soap powder boxes.
But since then they have been shrouded in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have given up hiding in a hotel in Manila, calling for the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, President Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government loyalists had previously stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly drop out with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who were supposed to guard him, apparently ran over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces blocked the district around the noble hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the government had called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption allegations for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main site of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military personnel against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours of refusing the army to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
It now holds 20.05 percent of the share capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
One keeps the option open to further increase the share of Versatel.
The move aims to drive forward the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Earlier on Wednesday, there were already assumptions about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf-based network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution considers the shares to be only a third party, it said in the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet had already taken a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of which have been bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have launched discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile radio products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and not make use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their stake in Freenet AG, it said.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet about a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been going on for months and is still difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and full-line customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held a direct 6.01 percent share of Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another roughly four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent from investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
