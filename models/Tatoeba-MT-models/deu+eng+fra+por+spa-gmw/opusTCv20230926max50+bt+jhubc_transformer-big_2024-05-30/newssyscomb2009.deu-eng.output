Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they come to 29 percent overall
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous big coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought about the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday after the first preliminary results.
Particularly severe losses were suffered by the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the table.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state captain Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest power in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP lost almost 9% of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially for the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters have probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received provisionally 18%, the BZÖ eleven% of the vote - the Social Democrats expressed at the same time their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated jointly, when the People's Party had even conciliated with the populists (at that time the FPÖ had made a deal with the Union, which was still unified in 2005).
Jörg Haider is obviously relying on this development, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
The Green Party, however, suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent threshold and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York following today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't clear up, then surely there will be some cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on the basis of a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all this, he pointed out that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government wanted to join the local government in Dardjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus ask for release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted “competent legal assistance,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such help is already being offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a strong interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner, he reaffirmed that the Czech Republic is a major contributor to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister departed.
“I’ve already been promised quite a lot,” he merely stated.
A Czech judges about wrestling for the seabed
It approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
Its chief, the division director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it to and from.
Work elan and enthusiasm reign here.
The seabed is home to a little-known world rich in natural springs.
Here you can find oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN Convention, they are exercising their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, a continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be substantiated by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many costly investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo was recently encountered by the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the seabed extension approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that will flow to them from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise themselves, be invaluable.
Other countries will also gradually submit their proposals.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the “Montego Bay Agreement.”
Where the continental shelf ends, the territory of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer a special position in this country.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not a gold mining land,” says director Mikulka, adding that “its individual territories are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored.”
Category: Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it, as well as the investors of a few other states, received the status of a so-called "breakthrough investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Silent Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is structured there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"Funding can be done there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich find of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said Pakshi Rajan, an Indian lawyer.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the fabulous scheme that the legend has brought to life according to the Golem.
German Special Forces were on site during hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
The circumstances of the liberation of eleven abducted European tourists in Egypt are becoming more and more detailed.
German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
Accordingly, specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officers of the GSG 9, the air force of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Agency were at the site of the liberation.
However, German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany in order to integrate it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has almost failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones rushed into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on the MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Even in the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed by more than six percent or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the government’s bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming known of the failure, crashed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers are seeing increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, according to a study, the desire of the Germans to travel remains untroubled.
For the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced in Berlin on Monday.
According to the research carried out by the market research institute GfK, booking figures have already risen for the autumn months.
For example, the sales growth of the travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which analyses monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and calculates them for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, trips to the United States in particular were in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking growth amounts to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic areas are particularly in demand among the Germans.
Packages in particular were high on the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs here are “better calculable for the customer than for the individually organized holiday”.
Money could save consumers by, among other things, early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will again be up compared to the previous year - although according to a further study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip, decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter-cups and celebrities in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is a blonde, television presenter and wears a bespoke dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, already the photographers rush on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white sausage equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited until now.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or lederhosen; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only harvests my dirndl apron.
One Munich girl reminds me that I had tied the apron wrongly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
Hiddenly, I fringe the loop from the back to the left.
"It's okay," he said and laughed.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the bare buttocks out to an uninvited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an elongated "ooooo".
This he tells me after he has rid himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the festival square, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time carry a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
You can't see who's under the tarp in the promille coffin.
"That's where goarnimmer packs," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in turmoil.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey Expands Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the hinterland of Turkey.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to decay.
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access it was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-thinker in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist plans crippled during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt, pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artful roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely passing from history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it, to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighbouring regions, created by the Cold War borders, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I went on the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the pace of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a custom-made, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first deals of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
“The objective of the Party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would be either one or the other.
She would have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could be forced to decide at some point," I asked?
“Turkey,” he said, “would not have to face this decision.”
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to almost routinely canceled: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be able, in a figurative sense, to drive Europe as a whole on the same railroad tracks eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Knight and Mr. Conu, who had watched during the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the pier for the ferry to take me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called “the sick man of Europe” in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was meant for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music that was presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether it was a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never subsided for years.
How many times did death lead us to “let the music speak for itself”.
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never dominating but never surpassing.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one—often I’ve been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal humility.
He detested conductors who, according to his words, simply "habited with one or two known showhorses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research fellowship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the power they emit, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda began marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this spacious sedan offers an even larger one.
In addition, there are the technical details that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes ahead of the impending revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this large sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed, compared to the other manufacturers, to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the assumed growth on the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7% of the total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
In more detail, the release of the new Honda Jazz model makes it possible to cover up the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to end the year with total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% year-on-year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda relies on the release of a new model.
It is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to market estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The release of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-litre gasoline engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2-litre variant achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 revolutions with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - Jazz's predecessor model reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bee' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more specifically, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behavior of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s technical development center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the facet eyes of the bee, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, which allows it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two meters in front of the BR23C and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is translated directly into a collision avoidance signal.
“The moment obstacle is noticed, the little robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90o or even greater angle to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this evasion maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it weren’t, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, but also cannot overlap; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and in infinite ways, as bees do.
For this reason, in addition to accelerating and decelerating functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids collisions.
<0x60>This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres performed, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs or even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the next ten years in series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to guide you to the destination while driving, avoiding obstacles along the way.
She's shaking before she gets loaded with a mortgage.
One must realize that the U.S. Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent US citizens from getting involved in mortgage histories of the supposedly bankable banks, a fun and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or perhaps, the 'hotel of bad credit' or of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, two and up to three times if it is the time to not ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
Surely it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley to provide its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG will buy 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley common stock at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the value of the stock as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be re-sold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, fell by 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to holding bank status,” said John Mack, the group’s director general.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which will allow it to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s managing director, said in Tokyo, “we thought the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its stock value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the deal will take place with a reduction in profit of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter is exchanged at more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. at approximately $47, within a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to leverage investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase sales.
A spokesperson for the group, however, refused to provide more precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said he had "significantly" lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch their stock market price drop by half as the price of insolvency insurance skyrocketed.
That price fell on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivors” of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-founding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the election this Sunday.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results reaching 80% of the votes, in the popular vote 64% voted 'yes'.
According to these results, 28% voted ‘no’, 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were cast empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, one vote must be obtained more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at polling stations and a counting of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for ‘yes’, and predicted 63% to 70%.
By the way, on the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The “Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the Organization of American States (OAS) Observation Board, referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” for which the President is advocating.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely on oil production by foreign companies and on the foreign exchange that sends immigrants into the country.
The project, led by the Correa elected in 2006, also concedes to the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
In the end, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad.
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and intact manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived aboard a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base right next to the Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a foreigner district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They all enjoy “best health” and the kidnappers “were not paid a ransom,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the rolling field.
After being captured on 19 September during an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the Special Forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“Shots fell on both sides and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled,” said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently, on the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and the special forces,” he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The day before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle during a patrol in which the hijackers were found, of which they killed six, including the Chadian leader, and two arrests.
The army stated that it was linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the movement Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), but immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums that are granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving to death?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros only for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all governmental districts, by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Societies of History, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 Societies of History, endeavor to study history intensively, with a few dimes to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux states want to take over the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has fallen into turmoil due to the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
Over the weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions now being taken in connection with the bank could be precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is expected to sell part of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The Fortis shares began a steep descent last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The institution’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to management, the $700 billion US bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is attributable to the decline in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the Bank’s new Director-General.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested person with a factual offer.
The Belgian government was, however, seeking reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, there has been no panic among the customers, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance in America often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens," quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the Prescription Data Tracking Program.
Insurance companies determine the fees as well as the payment amounts in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be assessed too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the client was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer’s identification number, he retrieves the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, that is, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically rank him in a higher-risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the aforementioned ones are not.
For the retrieval and processing of the data, their own companies have formed, which, before referring the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not been punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with the data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time controlling its use becomes more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly forbid access to his data, since the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left somehow to the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
India and the European Union are doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main theme among other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and voices on international issues, Member States have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. increase to a good 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had increased from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally consolidated into an agreement, so that air transport will also be boosted in the future.
India plans to sign the free trade agreement with the EU by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi ranks only nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
These included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed with this, as well as the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to cut greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be tackled, so both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion are expected for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be agreed on for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The Under-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is declining throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
A year ago, billionaire Steve Fossett’s small plane disappeared.
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the missing billionaire on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: "The plane has been located and a troop has been dispatched, and now we have the certainty that it was the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Highway Traffic Safety (NTSB) noted that a few hours after the plane was sighted, a crew was dispatched to identify the plane: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett took off on a three-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were also found in California, near the Nevada border, by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long string of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth run, as the first man to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single non-stop flight with an airplane.
Among his many records is a 15445 m altitude flight over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A Suv that falls from the traditional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the release of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different phases, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will so apparently emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
Then, using the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments, in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is Mercedes’ concern with this advertisement to introduce a new kind of author’s advertisement into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in irritating the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has traveled behind the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right middle.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia came into contact with these groups in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori, on which the towns of the militants appear, but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards had been provided to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been charged in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation offenders who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be released immediately, and that in no case will give such behavior the possibility of justification," it said.
Therefore, "Eyes on especially also with regard to the national team's game on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sports supervision) meets on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the position of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the No. 1 Osservatorio, “crimes are punished in the country of their deeds.
Until now, this group had kept in check, but now it has to be reconsidered what has happened and what will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the hymn of Mameli: even this is not a crime, but allow me, because education is lacking.
