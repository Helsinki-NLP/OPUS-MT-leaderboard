Spectacular jump in wingsuit over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many pawns had gathered to observe his feat.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair declining highway infrastructure, many are envisioning a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches itself above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record every mile travelled by a motorist and transmit the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to rework the outdated system of financing major U.S. roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of major axes planning has suddenly provoked heated debate and hectic alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is really essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, director general of the Southern California Association of Governments, which expects the state to start recording the miles each California motorist has traveled by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by one cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently had trackers installed on 500 cars to test a mile-long payment system.
“It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long run,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious laws on global warming.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also considers it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The free market supporters of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for the mile.
“It’s not just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. transport secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the way of mile payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural lawmakers representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to town.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the most important experience in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their every move.
“Anxiety about Big Brother and that kind of thing is a big deal,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management in Nevada’s Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people want.
From the beginning of the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged locators."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily goings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It was looking to break into the emerging car insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices she tests liked big-axis planners because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are looking to develop a taxation scheme that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a real-time speed dataset from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a document on urban development.
However, some transport planners are wondering if the whole mile-payment debate isn't just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so that each pays his fair share.
“There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Listening
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, which was released in January, he concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several unreleased.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone panicked.
On his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that we could still rely on him to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for your fans
Not tired of the surprises, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke will re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will feature three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously unveiled clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe Edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces at the same time each of the records, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, most importantly, he gives a taste of his new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and a rock electricity skillfully mastered.
Unpublished already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a luminous cavalcade that gradually slows down to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this cheerful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, bewitching, make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn informant, man on board a rocket, potential Martian...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays adopting different personalities, as he has throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is no surprise that he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by failing to allow injured military personnel - who do not comply with the army's "universality of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including one of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case followed that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not comply with the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine how much latitude it can afford to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but are unfit for combat.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required length of service to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veterans spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney launches an animated series on tablets
The US media and entertainment group Disney has decided to favor tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie’s Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet app.
Its global launch on Disney Group channels is only planned for 2014, details the statement from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, aimed at children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a city in the American West where she makes order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode consists of two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared with 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for U.S. intelligence, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA had eavesdropped on German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States,” he should take advantage of it.
German Green MP Ströbele posted a photo of him with Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer for the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be “safe” there, he said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video-on-demand service via their TV in the not-too-distant future.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary testing of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus follows in the footsteps of its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary has not yet a specific date for this new platform.
"We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in talks with some major cable distributors to make its service available through their broadcasting platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government in his Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for <0xC3><0xA0> la carte services.
“We’ve been saying for about two and a half years that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
However, he hoped that the consultations of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to some interesting recommendations.
"There will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference for defining our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decrease from net earnings of 44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline in depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues rose 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet does not worry about the number of clients fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat was found in cans of beef products sold by two small British retail outlets at low prices, the food hygiene agency said today.
Routine testing revealed that the products, produced in Romania in January and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"Since horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Highway 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving in the north direction, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the plane's descent.
The new hand baggage charges apply to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
Airlines began charging for first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as many things as they could in the hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It’s about making Frontier’s most loyal customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queuing at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s hand baggage charges will not apply until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often groan about baggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them did not cover the baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed suit a little later.
The only other airline imposing such charges is Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely tracks the charges in addition.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers discovered unusual hand luggage charges imposed by the company.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see grinding teeth and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers got on board at the speed of lightning.”
Frontier also does as Spirit and applies a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who drink coffee can be reserved for free.
She will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but went back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge hand baggage charges when passengers do not buy their tickets directly from the airline is its latest effort to encourage customers to go to its website.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of turning to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half of loyalty miles to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced the mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown, Denver, but her business declines and she loses money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that caused its public site to crash for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the breakdown was due to a distributed denial of service [DSD] attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are aimed at flooding a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, a time dubbed the “No Such Agency,” has come under the spotlight and been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked by former Snowden consultant NSA.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and the employees were met individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Félix Bisson, Delta Hotels’ regional director of labour relations.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Either he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
Titan CEO: “Goodyear Amiens acquisition project starts with zero employees”
After throwing the sponge with a bang in January for the partial takeover of the Goodyear site in Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of U.S. pneumaticist Titan, declares, today, ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the project to buy the plant in January, you are coming back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers" who "work three hours" a day, of "crazy" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-of-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of taxation and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when working eight hours in other countries handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are worked.
I have no prejudice about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to grow.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and competent workers, it is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the plant closure, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan is buying the closed plant from Goodyear.
As a result, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paying jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among Goodyear’s approximately 1,200 current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for CGT and Goodyear to seal an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure those 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year warranty.
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the project to buy the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we provide lifetime guarantees when there are no employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier profits fall as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, amid pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contract problems in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious timeline for commercial commissioning before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter only flew three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results did not live up to expectations and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from “outperforming” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for the stock market to rise over the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“While the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the in-flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft enters commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing on schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the plane’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to make a first flight and plan an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen again throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to depart in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is assessing the entry into service schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slowness in flight testing – although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.

The delay in the Aerospace division was $32.9 billion as at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.

Two 23-year-old and 27-year-old speleologists have been missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, according to the Speleo relief de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one skilled in practice and the other not, had left underground Thursday at about 9:30 pm to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
There has been no news of them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to Speleo Aid in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on the spot
About twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Speléo Auxiliary, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
In the late afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th battalion of the Chasseurs alpins de Chambéry, were found "exhausted, but not wounded".
They got lost in the network, turned on their feet while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refeed, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists urged to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union on Thursday invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using search engines and messaging from Google and Yahoo until further notice,” she said in a statement.
According to the Washington Post, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The searches carried out by journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Repainted fires: MP calls for resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' plan to "relift" the traffic light poles in Brussels is not pleasing to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched on Thursday in the center of Brussels a test project consisting of repainting 16 posts of traffic lights in the region with the yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to the Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend Brusselsers' money madly in signpost relifting operations in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of Flemishization of the Capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-black yellow the poles of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
Brusselsers deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is carrying out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan Horse of Flanders.
"By way of reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes, which is 0.5% of the Brusselsers!" concludes De Bock.
the Pont-de-Buis portico dismantled
The ecotax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the spot shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted as a result.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the Finistère prefecture on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomov, manager of the gantry.
This is the last of the three ecotax porticos operating in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers who own a prototype of connected glasses signed Google.
They can thus acquire an earphone, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $ 50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earphone.
While Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale release date has yet been confirmed.
It's been five years since my father wiped himself out of the world of the living.
In the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “frequent” it.
There is no recipe, no manual to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then there were signs.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that no longer leaves me, posed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her body empty, cramped on this crooked bed of hospital sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was an icy farewell focused around the meager glow of candles framing his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small day or night apparitions, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought that thought she was in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her sojourn in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and liberated the person I loved, and behold, I found her, full and whole.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside as well as out" he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he got old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I got scared, when I got hurt...
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me with my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents aren’t here anymore, but I feel them all the time.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it’s too late, only there’s always one thing that keeps me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I deeply feel their absence.
Sometimes some dreams carry me to the contrary and fit into my story and in fact, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound when I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and rejoicing that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to signify to me that he joyfully shared what was happening to me.
And, of course, it was a little boy in my stomach.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I enjoy recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of becoming a master in a major school, were not, in retrospect, trivial choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes on me.
My mother passed away nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that is triggered alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time eased the pain.
Only the lack, this emptiness without an answer, this need of her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the depths of her sweetness remained.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning, I see his anxious eyes resting on me, I see the circles that weigh his gaze, the fine lines around the lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
That was his promise on his pain bed, so little by little we learned to smile again, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the backwardness of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very much, absence cannot snatch it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or appreciated.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I have had problems in my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is this genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It is almost thirty years since my husband passed away at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course lessened but it is still close to me.
Very often it "disembarks" in my dreams in a way so precise, so vivid that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answers me "I'm coming down" but in such a real voice that I woke up in a jump, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world would I leave this house where we have been happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a job of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad on Friday released official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not resolved, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will expand as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They held signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assizes.
A top defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after he became compromised because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was dubbed "Bash" and considered by the criminals to be a "case of prime importance", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed towards Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted 32-year-old Sarborough dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of the Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought information illicitly about the arrest of two men on Scarborough's behalf and one of his associates.
The four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Along with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his drug addiction would be exposed.
Today, at Liverpool’s Assize Court, Ditta, who works at Blackburn’s Forbes Solicitors, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of impeding justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s fall came after police investigating Scarborough discovered he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing 60% pure drugs under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner party at the Ewood Park football stadium, home of the Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug and they phoned each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of the class A drug in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, stating that he had spoken to the alleged drug trafficker as his client and arguing that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him at his home for legal reasons.
But the court heard testimony that it was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “If anyone needs to know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the ordinary boundaries of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal act and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 3 p.m., I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal lawyer to criminal himself since he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the ulterior motives of the leading members of organized criminal groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should abide by the strictest integrity rules and build a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now of impediment to justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals to let them know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five others involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta hosted a question-and-answer session about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest for dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin to return to the stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on Dec. 21 at the Sound Board Room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous Respect interpreter had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a mantle of light: one could close the heat stroke in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice that, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of street lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the perpetrator of the shots.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five playlets imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Société d'art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Destinations lyriques, a formula that now fills the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists from the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Opera Opera, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the colorature soprano Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as sweet to the ears as an air of The Bat.
Without providing precise figures, the president of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to show reassurance.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is shaping well, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
“Financials are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a step that we will take in seven years,” he said.
"I would say even beyond," added the managing director, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying guns for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New application for class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action application has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that this time took place at the Saint-Joseph Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The petition is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Sumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint-Joseph Oratory, where he served as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was for only three establishments, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us: "I was in that place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The particularity of the class action that has just been filed is to allow the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the Congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the complaints are brought by 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as many of the institutions concerned closed in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of Sainte-Croix and the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "have been aware of the sexual abuses perpetrated", and that they have "have chosen and nonetheless committed them".
The latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Mr. <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who has publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second step is the hearing on the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the Congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Significant fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a store in Montreal's LaSalle borough on Thursday night.
Rescuers were called at around 1 a.m. on Friday because of a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the site took almost an hour to control the blaze.
The fire "caused significant damage to the building's structure," said Montreal Fire Safety Service operations chief Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily housed, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical assistance in dying at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the Quebec Medical Assistance in Dying Bill.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would want to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the emphasis was placed on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Réseau des soins palliatives du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for the next generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes Vice President Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, Gatineau’s Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says the notion of end-of-life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan Press Outrages Controversial Media Law
“It’s a frightening country and it’s legitimate to ask the question: What will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?” the paper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it’s an extension of the government” and that content and advertising restrictions would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to parliament,” he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to "take control of the media", The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had been hit hard" and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The bill comes along with a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping mall last September.
Kenyan media has provoked anger from authorities by broadcasting footage of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly stole from the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "cleared" or unable to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also says the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “lively blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and picking.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and reinstated their staggering salaries of about 532,000 shillings a month tax-exempt – some of the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir to the management of the Cité-de-la-Santé Hospital in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or departures at all, the pharmacy department found itself severely staff-deficit.
Nearly 30% of the workforce was missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or diminished as time passes.
We certainly worked hard to get our young [pharmacy residents] to come and stay here.
There was a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this arduous period, the year 2013-2014 promises to be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back at work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the efforts made by the department to retain have paid off, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now it’s much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or a predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always go on three maternity leave when things are going well, she added.
In the last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start her film career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg in her upcoming film, Nymphomaniac.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old addicted to sex since her teenage years.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig-like silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on ice-cold paper will be displayed in much more sulphurous situations on a large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before fusing all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below, the liner.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses into their final entrenchments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Méga CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned the firefighters of a suspicious odor.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on tear jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
However, the management of the cinema has played the principle of precaution and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was airy and everything was in order.
The cinema was able to take back its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
Only on screen.
She's trying to import 2kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to bring in two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins, Thursday morning, at Montréal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine was divided into three pumpkins that had been emptied beforehand.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said CBSA spokeswoman Jacqueline Roby.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have made 173 seizures of drugs, including 10 seizures of cocaine for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting ground-sea Yakhont missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities moves to "B-", sinking into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves have fallen by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities are using massively to support the local currency, the collapsing hryvnia, the agency is increasingly likely to devalue, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev is also in need of liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying a bill of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was released the day after official statistics showed that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, up from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, which has a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which had granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far only released 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranches until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF noted this week that "the significant need for external financing" was "a vulnerability", while pointing out "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "we cannot expect any short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert told AFP.
The only hope is for an improvement in the international environment.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Yulia Timoshenko.
“Signing the deal would be positive for trade in the long term but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, which fears “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade area is created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. green light at Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objection from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second-largest global agency, Omnicom, and the third-largest, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, as provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the company said in a statement.
They also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorization decisions issued in other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the transaction.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory approvals and approval from the shareholders of the two groups,” they added.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven out of towns in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that it had been in control since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and pile it wherever it hides because it is criminal," FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring back peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills overlooking Bunagana, the last insurgent-held town to fall this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape from the government garrison and the passivity of the MONUSCO blue helmets.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest by force, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid-intervention brigade of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff has been redesigned and the army has gone into offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," Congolese business expert Jason Stearns predicted on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda has been present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it fiercely, of militarily supporting the M23, which was originally made up of former Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali mentioned the possibility of military retaliation following the shells dropped on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the soldiers of the FARDC.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be liberated one day by the army," said a resident of the border town of Uganda.
“We lived in terror, we are traumatized,” the man added.
Tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have been negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of having been affected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused about 50 deaths.
Chevron, the U.S.'s second-largest oil company, reported a quarterly profit decline on Friday due to lower refining margins, as its oil and gas production increased while staying behind the group's targets.
Net earnings in the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters expected an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpd for this year, with expected production growth of 25% by 2017.
The bulk of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell by 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil, said Thursday that its net profit was down, despite rising oil and gas production.
Transport of schoolchildren: the complaint found admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has charged a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," says Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, CSRS was invited to mediation and requested additional time to consider it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to consult and to find solutions," said Ms. Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu emergencies
Faced with the sling carried out for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "decelerate the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not take place on November 4".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed not to hinder the campaign of the PS a few months from the municipals.
Despite the ministerial directions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if, in the APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, the firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual visits to the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu emergency rooms will all be instructed to take thirty serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, the interns specializing in emergencies will give way to five interns of general medicine on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4," said Loïc Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in emergency," he said, citing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on site, he also assures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," said Nicolas Peju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
“The minister lied to us or we lied to her,” said Dr. Gérald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the sling against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "whistleblower" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
“If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
However, they are regularly overwhelmed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Lariboisière emergency rooms.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" to several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP are defending the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7 and which is expected to continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal GPs are also expected to participate in the establishment of a "permanence of ambulatory care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will be the same as in Level 3 maternity hospitals.
People are not crazy, they will go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency physician and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor of Paris and elected of the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, reminded again Monday morning on France Inter that she had pronounced herself in favor of a moratorium so that there is no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark its sharp disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, its spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of deferral to the other hospitals.
Obama Ends Hearing of IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to end its wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
The move is part of the White House's attempt to regain control of the NSA wiretapping case after revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank have been monitored by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official responded: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such monitoring had been in place in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the listening of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved a tightening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
UN welcomes new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were put in place 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in pushing forward the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the previous day in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overtake national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs), ” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow as conflicts erupt between powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Concerned about her country's future, she swapped her work clothes for a t-shirt with the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowds at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, backed initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have rocked foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
La Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of La Renamo, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant the deal was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and a specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections due to take place in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has steadily declined since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to obtain more votes in the elections.
Mazanga said Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the Renamo’s capability is, but it has conducted disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, notably Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has reinforced government frustrations, said Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and it’s up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultanane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
Thor's Legend might show that "brutal force does not weigh on subtle cunning," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too outrageous, and in some cases far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” causes children to “completely pick up,” the messages being “sublimated” into pleasurable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
One Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, according to medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to the sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were fired from an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. 'goes too far' admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged in Washington’s first confession in the midst of controversy with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I grant you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that doesn’t happen again in the future,” Kerry told a conference in London that he was attending from Washington on Thursday.
In his speech relayed, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information gathering by the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled numerous plans for attacks, through interception of communications and information gathering.
“We have effectively prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these plans in advance,” he said.
Kerry said, “I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived.”
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," said the secretary of state, who had already had to express himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday that President Obama was “resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel mistaken.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program dubbed “MUSCULAR,” and conducted with the NSA’s British counterpart, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by the internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the month of January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, to text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and as leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama declined to comment on the matter, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services that allegedly seized the communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies are cooperating with the United States and it would not be aimed at Europe at all, General Alexander said.
The controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also provoked China's wrath.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without its champion, the Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the Ligue 1 club in a statement.
PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in the difference of goals, released the list of players selected for this game of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "broken", without specifying the nature of the injury.
Nevertheless, he suffered from an inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, is due to attend, and will then explain at a press conference her proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, it is the opposite: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee for Funeral Ethics, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Taming Death.
It has only been tolerated by the Catholic Church since 1963, which has limited attempts to tame it.
To tame the cremation, it is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, Director General of Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of the French want one, for their loved ones, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
73% of people who chose a cremation now want a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers want it, too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the past ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of the ashes," said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, who perform, in the presence of the body, the following ritual: welcome the assembly, appoint the deceased, connect him to others, evoke him, give meaning to his death, organize the farewell.
This has been the case at the Père Lachaise crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several commemorative ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, for the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation because of rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their ground floor apartment in the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the director of the office Terres du Sud Habitat, has proposed, in an exceptional and provisional way, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, said Joël Canapa, the office's director.
There have always been rats in cities.
The deratization company carries out two visits per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and the rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, one child is not going to be killed.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," says the father of the family who left his home to settle at the hotel.
We are soon out of money and we are expecting a new housing, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends up down 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix fell 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house caught in flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms went on, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings glued here," said France Loiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec City fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who played the role of ceremonial master at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners emerged at the Carolines, and were hugely successful, until they became too famous to play at a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year’s event will feature Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes,” a comedy and music night for veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Many of the actors attending this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional tours, such as performing on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the theme of the joyously lascivious fantasy football of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and on the cast of Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, along with other singularly voiced young actors (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic racial justice advocate W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg talking with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in central Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down a alley between two buildings and say to himself, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Oil prices continue to fall, approaching $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about stocks offset a report showing China's electricity-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector that arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to pick up after growth bounced back to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline not seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Questioning the Right to Abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law could result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state clinics because these clinics have failed to achieve this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge ruled the day before the law came into force that the provisions dealing with the admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the trial ruling that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a comeback on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV set, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates presented themselves to the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored in this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of budding singers, for the better and sometimes for the worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some found their account.
Many have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) said that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The appeals court heard the arguments regarding the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she responded publicly to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by mistakenly targeting black men of Hispanic origin as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot program to test body-borne cameras in the neighborhoods where the most controls are held.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal by the city is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that concerned mainly black men and Hispanic origins.
A lawsuit was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Supporters advocating changes to the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, represent a waste of money, and do not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it was not ending the constitutional control and search practices, but reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pay on average $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to raise rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the outrageous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for $100,000 in fireworks, $4 million to $5 million in land for just in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the steps until he became a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed countless world leaders in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at retirement time, at 60.
The man with an open face, disguised skull and intellectual glasses, born on October 24, 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I've gone from one castle to the other!" ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his wife or companion who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen", to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Do not displease heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to terrestrial food, "they are all greedy," gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no demand for a specific diet".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially at state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the Elysée kitchens, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in his heart.
He said praise.
“His human side has come out,” he says.
The chef will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose over the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesperson for the Quebec City Fire Protection Service, said the rapid intervention of the firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
All in all, the damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Second Trailer Released
Martin Scorsese leaks some footage from his next film, whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will unravel you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a Long Island stockbroker who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street.
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a very wealthy man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the key words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have regained the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
It seems that the film finally lasts 2:45.
In the room on December 25, he will be able to participate in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a fake tip on an affair involving then-incumbent Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said in Old Bailey's court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "pretty special counselor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, with hacking Pawlby’s voicemail and “standing in front of her door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people's houses hoping to surprise them, it's the kind of man to like to present the story to people to see what they say about it," Edis said.
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, the surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say, “Of course we do.”
Rumors about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW’s editorial board when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, on which voice messages were recorded hacked on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire’s home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister stored in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Edis added.
In the meantime, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having conducted phone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The U.S. president was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, seeking help from the United States to fight the heaviest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq had its deadliest month in five-and-a-half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations reports an even higher death toll with 979 dead and 1,902 wounded.
The violence is increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence raises fears of a new blaze as neighboring Syria is plagued by civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the streets or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unfair arrests, has fostered this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the deaths of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against Al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the center of talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki who will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since arriving in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive and congressional officials.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to carry out a “third world war” against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian politics".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
China's head of homeland security accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists on Friday of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, crashed into the crowd that stood in the famous square of the Chinese capital, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in East Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority living in Xinjiang, call the province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there animated by independence claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told Hong Kong's Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that stood behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of East Turkestan," he added, as his remarks were taken up by the new China agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident left 42 people injured.
The Islamic movement of East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asked participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, a Catholic newspaper independent of the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to survey parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: The army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred fighters, were entrenched at almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba told AFP, who was reached by phone at about 12:30 p.m., and according to which a girl was injured by gunshot wounds in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has diminished a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels back a little bit."
According to the witness, wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "stayed the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "scanning operation".
There was a clear sound behind him of small arms-fed crackling.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of heavy weapons.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting has entered “a final phase” as the FARDC has “encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them.”
Since the clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army resumed on Friday, the MONUSCO has not participated directly in the fighting, but has provided decisive intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well stocked with ammunition, were going up towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, military personnel assisted by civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to replace another machine pounding the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday night again called on the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December with no result for now.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it remains only for Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its subsoil is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
We have the impression that the gunshots are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It’s a revolution: French-style musical is a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s rock opera, most attempts would get caught up in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment at Mogador changed the game.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit hits.
The first takes up this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the tune of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comedies musicales" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How are French musicals evolving?
The offer has multiplied.
First there are the "musical spectacles" that evolve according to the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump back fifteen years under the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora headlining.
Then we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety Anglo-Saxon musicals by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are attempting a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Spider-Woman's Kiss" or "The Spring Awakening" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musicals, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these jobs in many schools.
Jobs are numerous between regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as large as the number of vacancies.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor relative of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Musical performances fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) as the headliner of a musical show, is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly run by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a provincial zenith.
The mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all major theaters in France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injured in an accident with a ghost driver in the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5.30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who was unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m. at the accident site, as long as the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause traffic jams because the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be deflected by this exit/inlet of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children are playing on a charred armored vehicle that belonged to the M23 rebels, in Kibumba, on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on its own.
Only Runyonyi Hill will remain.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
A political stronghold and the last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23 have been entrenched at an altitude of almost 2,000 meters on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the fighting the day before and were buried.
A girl was wounded by gunshot wounds, and three others were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have given no record of the loss of life.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media said the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, again insisted in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-consultant, began to uncover his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. providers of cloud storage services, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused paranoia from companies over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and business transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that this data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents released by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on industrial secrets of foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its reliance on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock to some companies that hitherto thought China posed the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is happening in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data held in the U.S. is governed under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members have given up plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. data mining program Prism.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of the chemicals company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case it leaves the advantage to an adversary.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is at least reckless to retrieve a free USB flash drive from a business salon or leave a laptop unsupervised in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, said the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, had been a common practice for years.
The BfV in Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of harm to the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access,” the BfV warned in a report.
The United States is warning its own companies about economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty of second-degree acts of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A board member of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, believe their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found jammed on Jan. 11 in a carpet leaning behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s Investigators have concluded that Johnson died in unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a binder and we gave it back to them in a burial bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters the first autopsy indicated Johnson had died of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia ordered authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance recordings that investigators had examined.
The teen's parents said they hoped the video footage would contain clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC Publishes Advice on Child Allergies to Schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines outlining how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness among faculty and staff about food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen branded auto-injector – to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something stings my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have tingling on my tongue.”
NSA Case Highlights Total Lack of Intelligence Debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand is offended in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and on the other a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on U.S. diplomacy’s analysis of political and other issues around the world, we believe that, in the eyes of U.S. power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to outrage us about this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The implementation for roughly ten years of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States in particular have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and in return - as has already been said quickly - Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that should be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States deteriorating its image?
We may denounce them, but I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US providers subject to US laws, and therefore to the NSA's grip.
Last but not least, the vast movement of revelations initiated by media outlets around the world, which is helping to spark a debate over intelligence surveillance practices that have hitherto been virtually non-existent, could push lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children may choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to inscribe an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex persons.
According to the BBC, an intersex person reportedly said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, bruised and swept.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersex being part of the group of about sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual developmental disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but that’s not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It is like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and height), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
The young boys of non-conforming gender now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to enter male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeals trial that allowed her to keep an “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation next to M or F-X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators in this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for “gender theory” to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also objected to German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, we overthrow two other pillars of civilization.”
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be assigned to babies at their birth.
“The parenting role is stressful enough with no additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community considered gender as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now there are many who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who considered gender malleable.
He dedicated the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it can be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a sluggish circumcision to have him completely neutered, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex-changing operations say “that they are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a wide clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was made to take female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to grow.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, taking testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he is advocating for the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears German law “invites labelling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should fight at that age.
As they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said German law will “empower” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law gives parents some leeway so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and understand them, and a delay before entering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don’t have to rush into surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels the most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will continue until 2015 despite strong tensions between left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate vote approaches to drop Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the center-left leader said he had "firm intention" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former president of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last its refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters called at the scene of the tragedy said they responded to a call saying "multiple people were injured".
"Police forces are on site," the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second transported in a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the 2nd and 3rd teminals are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to immediately confirm whether one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza-sces
Israeli tank fire killed an Islamist Palestinian Hamas militant on Thursday and severely wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, according to health service sources.
A Hamas source said fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has merely referred to a “targeted action” in the area near a tunnel called a “terrorist” by the Jewish state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers to President Barack Obama have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and said Thursday night that the president’s close collaborators had conducted “extensive group work and polling at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, aimed at measuring what effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the ballot.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago campaign headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “didn’t significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and it was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the president wasn't in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the review "consistent," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial in the poll.
“The campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “knew” of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” was not definitively answering the question of whether the political polls had arrived on Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know Biden’s removal from the presidential list was under scrutiny.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluorescent ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the bright protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re still in the early stages of production, and 2g of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to shine.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed opportune to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween as it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because jellyfish luminescence is worth four times as much as gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
The Bristol-based company with Charlie's experimental approach is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Tai Chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" aimed at residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning while looking at the trees and doing the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his musician’s hands splitting the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a Tai Chi master, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to take him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're city dwellers, it's our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of life he had,” she said.
Lou Reed underwent a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more slender.
For the past two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I’m certainly not going to do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the cuddly sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy pros; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That makes a lot of curious dogs disguised as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't squirm.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, let’s not tell ourselves any stories, consume 41 million kilograms of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
That’s about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to unravel yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which is actually a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the America Haunts, and that includes those great photos of you peeing on you that your friends put on Facebook and you can’t remove and on which a guy you like leaves a “pretty head” comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The slowly wilting lantern pumpkins on your front porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more notice, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try carving their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create a <0xC2><0xA3>38bn (€45bn) in-house bad bank structure with the most risky assets, designed to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also said it would write an additional <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion in depreciation of dubious receivables over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said the internal restructuring would free up 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the “bad bank” would draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of meddling in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for customers and for the UK,” McEwan told reporters.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support, and vehicle storage between events.
Bowler Motorsport CEO Drew Bowler said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
“We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rallies in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raiding rallies.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable ledge in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a minor road accident.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
The firefighters went down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from a certain death.
A puppy was fortunate enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called in to safely retrieve it as it perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and made a call on social networking sites after she disappeared into the quarry following a no-serious accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person walking her dog spotted Ruby on a ledge in the quarry, trapped 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and went down a callback to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate some cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get away with it unscathed.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified to watch the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, of Keighley, added: "We were afraid that it would fall but it did not move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never flirted with Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorister on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He flirted with me when I was 18.
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added, "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album, Prism, landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question Turkmen Islamic movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia," the head of China's security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website late Thursday.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization since Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, hurled their car loaded with gasoline canisters against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares to fight for the independence of East Turkestan, the former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the UN in 2002 as one of the organizations affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: Breaking up Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States devote much of their time to circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for anything it wants to get from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I first heard the gossip that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arrived out of nowhere, garnered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the tightening of national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many to think that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has weighed on its members exchange rates favorable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public salaries and spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-constraint, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage freezes in the world will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is raging, especially in France, one of the EU’s great leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the French economy in trouble.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, sending the Socialists back to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single anti-currency and anti-European bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make a good figure in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment unique in Europe will unify and will eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like the free “Europe of Nations (sovereigns)” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will soften its eyes on the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a dramatic majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following Conservative/Liberal Democratic coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: getting older sooner
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts Think Obesity Epidemic Could Be an Early Puberty Trigger
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair begin to grow at age 7 or 8?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid shift towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as budding of the breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area, and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first period over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12-years-old three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first periods appear,” Kaplowitz, also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem, said in a statement.
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may warrant tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of early periods and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, rate of development, rate of growth, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but recognizes that “controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls of being different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have their period.
“They’re afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories made public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz says the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 who linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger facial and pubic hair, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls with early puberty need to be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix at the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the 1961 Greenwich Village and folk music that was just beginning to resonate with it, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise, had won the Palme d'Or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Despite being unable to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have made their dedication to the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also to the pop planetary star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich auras in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shiny clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath deflected to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" is a week-long story of the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He accepts rear-facing foot replacements in the studios.
Without accommodation, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what we were interested in: a mix of bad luck, a guy who’s not there at the right time, who’s not careerist but who’s integer, with self-destructive behavior,” Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards at Cannes, told reporters.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two filmmakers fans of folk music built their story on real personalities of the time like the folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would spawn international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes on documentary looks, from the invaded dusty music label of 33T unsold inhabited by an old unpaid secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen Brothers still works by incorporating a funny character that runs through the film all the time: a gorgeous red cat with a crisp look, Llewyn Davis’s companion of fortune.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good," "hazard can also launch someone's career," and "increasingly today."
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be stuck by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times described him as “the author of spy novels who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically diminished by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, claimed to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS <0xC3><0xA0> Istanbul", the first in the series, nearly half a century ago.
"There is no doubt between 120 and 150 million countries," he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch avenue close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS' adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories brought from the 130 countries surveyed to situate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, goes after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never pretended to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went to the scene and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS’s father used to say “make some kind of geopolitical soap opera.”
“I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving,” Gérard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people from the services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often forewarning: thus, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in that city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in Panic in Bamako, he reported the 4x4 columns of jihadists that were based on the Malian capital.
I am not a fortune teller, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "whose parts have all been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page with a pen.
On the walls of his office are hanging AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am still well received in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers once said, “Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age.”
He will not die and will not retreat.
No more than me.
Aircraft manufacturers are quarrelling over the width of seats as large orders are at stake
The dispute is raging between major aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The conflict concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – which are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its big American rival Boeing says it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record ordering during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential to the economic performance of the “mini-jumbo” segment.
Boeing says its redesigned “777X” will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aerospace giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus appeals directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were able to realize recently what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?"
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ chief commercial officer.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American's weight from 40 to 49 years old increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American’s waist circumference is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival clings to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the aircraft was narrower.
Airbus says it has commissioned a study that indicates an additional inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat width and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience doesn’t just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s passenger satisfaction officer.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim per-seat efficiency in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20 percent higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to pack more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in terms of our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of passenger comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial standpoint, Airbus’ proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors around the world even take a meter with them to check competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but says it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more customization of cabins by offering wider aisle-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say its call to the aerospace industry to set up a size standard for seats is unlikely to succeed, but that it could make the 777X sales wave forget.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the group's financial performance.
The vote is not binding but tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just crowned by his ship's victory in the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison received a negative vote on her salary.
The CEO of Oracle renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but it received about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only one symbolic dollar.
For the full year 2013, Oracle's net profit rose 3.5% while the jump stock price of 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which rose 24% at the same time.
New Nicotine Vaccine Could Suppress the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his or her nicotine dose.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated “were calmed,” the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have proven ineffective because they contain antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the military and the activist movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in the strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone fire," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, had informed the British government that talks had been initiated with the Teherik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid pressured several state ministers to renew his leases at Circular Quay, where Obeid owns two restaurants and a café, after their expiry in August 2005, without a tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former deputy secretary general, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressed for tendering the leases.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for the Circular Quay businesses, which reported to the Obeid about $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, he acknowledged, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's orders at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the topic discussed in these phone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't like that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently considering the possibility of putting in place a “authenticity test” for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it considers extending crackdowns.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used for unskilled positions or as a misleading means of bringing family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The shocking statements about ‘foreigners coming back in line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that were previously envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for “whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal associate of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring company.”
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's 9-year-old son was traveling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday from an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7bn to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6bn.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study strengthening rail capacity and improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of no more than three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also a matter of developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “unequivocally” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "High-speed rail has the potential to deliver significant economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.”
The rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to loosen regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “plane” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision requiring U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no immediate intention of changing their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure continued safety and passengers to comply with safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we truly believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the in-flight entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that immediately,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and passenger instructions.
“As soon as an airline has verified its fleet’s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a quarrel involving several people broke out on the side of the Post.
At least four casualties were to be deplored.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore Loans Take Advantage of Middle Class Forced To Tighten Their Belts
At a pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay the school fees for her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as a steward and her husband works as well, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is so high in parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is rising — that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, this week became the third pledge lending company to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Putting on jewelry pledges is not only a quick way to get cash — $1,300 from Singapore in Ms. Amirthalinga’s case — but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore pledge lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pledge lenders have the advantage of not requesting a credit check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressure from rising cost of living and overindebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to fill the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, stemming mainly from rising mortgage lending, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged shortly this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or low [wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city’s 200 pawnshops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back to get it next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
ValueMax, the store operator in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its managing director.
The company will fund them by using 60% of Singapore’s $66 million it raised this week when it entered the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have come under criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase the debt.
“Customers are mortgaged on assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The pledge is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed funding in the short term.
People who go to pawnshops are also not just those who have financial problems.
Wealthy Singaporeans also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold bars or Rolex watches, which can represent up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It can be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who have cash needs to go through a difficult course,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth minister in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He went to the supermarket in Nazi uniform before being chased out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a cuff and a swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, as customers complained to the management of the establishment who called police, the store said on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police to the rescue, but “by the time it came, it had already left without breaking up,” she added.
I was standing in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were speechless.
"You don't go out like this unless you want to get attention," Rosina Rusin, a 60-year-old client, told the Cambridge News.
This incident happened on Thursday, Halloween day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," Dutton said, explaining that he was suffering from "mental problems."
$325M Rescue Plan for Tasmania Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the failing health care system has stringent conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent action” to end a crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, planned over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania’s independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to make up for the delay.
Funding is also provided for no-show clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical executives, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments reflect the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to care for Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent assistance it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope the federal aid plan will go a long way toward removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "solution of fortune."
“The reason we are here is that the state Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that takes away almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretend it's a splendid day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no salvage plan dollars would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Higher Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narrative could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline of the
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit and storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the human toll through a network of militants based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, 18,678 of whom were fighters of pro-government forces and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups, in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no clarification.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a long-running civil war on tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, stated that its team was “now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned at this time."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that the chemical weapons program elements they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I commend the moral strength and courage you have all demonstrated in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, the organization’s director general, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been a heavy explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger provoked by the sentence handed down against one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass killings for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded many.
He has also been found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked for the man, dubbed a "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the execution platoon,” Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and was "dead" three times while on respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
To spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to reestablish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was ridiculous about the grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from door to door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile phones — under the much-anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated crew training manuals and rules regarding aircraft storage to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their planes.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to re-ignite them until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives the green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when disembarking from the aircraft before landing and not turn them back on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will be beneficial to everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS, or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was ejected from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be put away because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones lies with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered risky.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relays if used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue recommended last month that the government authorize wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as device use has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only broadcast minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for loosening restrictions on passengers’ use of electronic devices.
In 2011, company executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader airliner and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has inspired mixed feelings among FAA advisory board members about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low-visibility conditions.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them commonsense arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that an enjoyable passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicopter-dried after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water grate was lifted aboard a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month before it was brought back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa rescue center.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This water rattling was probably a wintering migrant who came from Northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of strong winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted for help.”
The water ranch was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and jobs creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the broadest and most comprehensive survey from UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get caught up in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – from regulating monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competencies should go back to Westminster.
The single market has led to general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and even more so, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This finding, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – succeeding in changing the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% turnaround in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies are supporting this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will be a significant shift in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses it means re-focusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not departed from the tradition of Halloween.
Last night, he and his wife handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were canceled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the partygoers caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich Village".
Everyone is overexcited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I had planned for last year.
We have fun like crazy people, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline ushers in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe is transited, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct junction with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is commissioned in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, the daily News of Tahiti announced Thursday, taking up an information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty mutinies, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen residents, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutinies, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95% on London's generosity.
The Island Council unanimously voted to create a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate the request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuary this 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already conduct the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the EEZ of French Polynesia, near Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor in northeastern China's Jilin province was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of hitting more than 19 million yuan with bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first intermediary court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as unstoppable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the junior officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former Chongqing CPC leader Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education instructor was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel with the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was unaware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate, noting, “external YMCA checks were carried out and indicated that child safety was a top priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second-lowest ratings on four institutions during a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare dismissed the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was left alone with the children, kept them private, made them sit on his knees, told them he loved them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and had requested child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found the YMCA Caringbah Child Services Manager, Jacqui Barnat, who supervised Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director General said that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord blurred their judgment, causing them to fail to report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the New South Wales YMCA board saying that, for the organization, the lesson from "the Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA’s Chief Children’s Officer Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence, but that it was “excessive zeal” and that it had been poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" with staff recruitment, oversight, initiation, training and supervision.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old voiced his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to regain the position of prime minister, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so..."
When many equestrian event experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making their first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted through the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are of the same size – were hailed for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Coming up against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to make his 2-year-old Toffee pony scroll around the track.
Fenton was hailed by judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child his age.
And Toffee received very good ratings for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
Her mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great duo.”
They presented themselves to and against all, but both scooped the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee and we were thrilled that he won.
On the trail, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering and applauding it."
He ran the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he cares for.
From the way he started, he will surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and the way they marched on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked great.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be reworked"
A Chinese newspaper that has made a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be reworked, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fabricate stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order for "redesign" is issued by the Guangdon Administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, owned by the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The writing of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete reshuffle of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately reshuffle the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made a televised confession.
Experts say people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is flying.
The leak of radioactive steam detected at one of the two Charles-de-Gaulle nuclear boilers in mid-October, while the ship was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but not without consequences for the Navy.
La Royale has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are necessary" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, specialized in naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
For them, it is, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler.
"Everything is being done so that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not in any way call into question the program of activity of the ship" nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle leaves an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had departed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the confinement space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I am able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to be finished.
In short, endless siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of wasted dollars could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, in spite of the closure of all the major companies, we do not bother about the sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of the lame ducks: deficit cultural center, high subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not up to the public level to invest in such companies, but rather to the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the Fisheries and Piles lakes will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline of the population, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been run for more than 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep farmer does worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, the United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs came out unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railroad tracks that started from the kitchen of a Tijuana home and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition warrant for Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "notice of remission" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to go to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following sex crime allegations, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a delivery notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to go to a police station, on the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site battling secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Are you done typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to assure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this craze for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will deliver new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its constraints.
"For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity domain at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a drawback: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out for about twenty years on other approaches, such as face recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we’re doing research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but it takes a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also arouses hope and concern.
"At the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and foresight at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification has hitherto concerned the issuance of identity papers: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (imprints, photo, iris) with the information that the State has about all citizens already registered.
This ensures that one person does not attempt to impersonate someone else.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
“We retrieve the images from the surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, NEC France’s Business Development Manager for Biometric Identification Solutions.
Another use: take a photo of a quidam queuing in a store, track his progress with facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially involved physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing for another," justifies Cyrille Bataller, Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some ATMs by inserting your card and placing your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keying of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retailers: when paying in stores with their bank card, the customer does not type their code, but inserts their finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in checkout thirty seconds shorter, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people's identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which crashes if one tries to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
But in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists, on the other hand, continue to be concerned.
“The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” predicts Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 almond
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be taken between his legs.
At the Colchester Trial Tribunal, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary prudence and attention.
The seven points removed on his license led to a 6-month license withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign property owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in Budget 2012, entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties in a corporation rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on high-value properties, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are undertaxed independently of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell.”
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector in southwest London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London showed steady year-over-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just shed light on how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what was going on with other species.
He added that, just like in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t take long before we understand why their tails sometimes go to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to manipulate the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog shaking the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog shaking the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deflecting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the tail-swinging dog), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet other dogs repeatedly and notice that most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers say the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs would go to a robot dog more easily when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could come from the fact that the dogs participating in the different studies did not fully consider film animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many evidence, found in different mammals, indicates that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it probably won’t take long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform Friday at The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, her laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement came after the band was forced to postpone a concert at Birmingham's LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the one at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican said Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so that is up to a group of 120 “cardinals electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinals electorate will likely have declined.
He said a pope usually appointed as many cardinals as needed for the number of cardinals electing to reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a sort of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided on his own.
“Francis has now chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was "perfectly possible" that Francis seeks advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said the popes generally elevated bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will appoint.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the back of the seats
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with manually tiltable backrests, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could be defective in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is impacted from the rear, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, increasing the risk of injury," the statement said on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM’s pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed the growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's share price rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday afternoon in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred at about 11 a.m. on Rue Marquette, near the intersection of Rue Beaubien, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A contiguous foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived at the construction site in order to retrieve his tools.
I was driving past and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke,” said Sylvain Jean, who remains near the construction site.
I disembarked and went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
We could only see part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The Cry of Despair of an Obama Voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism
The obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the gloomy second year of medicine and give me hope.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and is the memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical records at night and went to bed, this book takes me back to the time when politicians inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in an overwhelming victory and news anchors took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama’s transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% in favor.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our military, to the end of “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to move our nation forward in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration from my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide an explanation.
I am on the brink of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s misdeeds.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or evading public funding and exceeding authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, she can’t excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all of the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term and freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises we’ve heard for so long.
Yet, while the index of favorable opinions has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to go back to the year 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton in the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are now five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from the system.
The mining tycoon, who disputes the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Election Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Fairfax Sunshine Coast by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a reshuffle of the voter turnout system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn’t we have a system that you can enter, enter your contact details into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options with regard to e-voting and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM), returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin surprise you?
That’s good news, but it doesn’t surprise me particularly.
If in the past, species were described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the sciences of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are called into question because of advances in genetics.
In the same way, two species very close morphologically have been distinguished thanks to genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only at this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we may have to deal with the extinction of a species, rather than the local extinction of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species originated, its stock has automatically become smaller, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is being spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time that this changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division, according to two sources close to the file, once again showing that regulators’ global investigation into suspected currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the broadening investigation that echoes the scandal of the manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said that RBS had forwarded files of emails and instant messages, sent to and from a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as the European head of currency spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of spot currency trading at Citi, was on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations of bankers agreeing to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are scrubbing instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers for investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been crippled, a lawyer says
After police confirmed they got their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby said he had never seen an investigation "also sluggish".
Mr. Ruby told The Canadian Press that he believed the police had “ignored or downplayed” the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed the man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, new court documents show.
Mr. Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police had never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Police Chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr Ruby's remarks an "obvious and desperate attempt" to speak out to the media in a case that did not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock markets down at mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are trading down Friday at mid-session, driven by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could unleash its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the entire euro area, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures predict an upward opening of U.S. equities, after two consecutive pullbacks.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest fall of the CAC 40, stamped by the earnings warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the EuroFirst300's worst performance, after also releasing declining results this morning and announcing the creation internally of a bad bank with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of EuroFirst300 increases in response to press information that AT&T is considering a possible bid.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy is on the rise, as evidenced by John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB’s single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the fall of the euro.
Against this backdrop, the euro continued its decline against the US currency and hit a two-week low at $1.3517.
The same conjectures support the eurozone bond market in reverse.
Supreme Court Approves Obama’s Health System Reform Law
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care reform law ratified by Obama to be constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act — which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, otherwise they will have to pay a fine — and declared it constitutional under the government’s taxing power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page Act and found that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered in order to avoid losing all federal funding for the program, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All of the major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Graves were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israeli-Palestinian Hook on Gaza Border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded Thursday evening in a violent crash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip has ceased operation on Friday after its fuel stocks were exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another senior member of Hamas’ armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes in southern Gaza, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a 100-meter incursion into the territory before withdrawing.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during an incursion by the Zionist occupier into Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli military said the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and destined, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the purpose was to abduct Israeli soldiers and exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting IDF forces and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck a military air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles aimed at the Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
“In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he said.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, relying on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies at Danse Danse: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second infused by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, also white, in the immense space that is the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre Maisonneuve, advances, profile, thin as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, a simple line, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next script appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in relays of solos, in group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "Glory of the Morning", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online at the front stage.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace always fast.
There will be breakage when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monotone and monotonous in the auction, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as those hairs that scuffle or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has prevailed, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a wider and more giddy imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the welcome was warm.
Gymnopedias, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers relay themselves to play the scores.
Their awkwardness in music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in loving duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, with a red nose, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnassists, fugitives or gamblers.
The gesture, the laughter and the small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and ridicule of the bodies in coitus, of the beings that merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the universes explored overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a disorder cleverly calculated that remains sensual.
Joy and madness perspire, and it's Chouinard's art there to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday began an avalanche of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it stowed at the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Assizes in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow advertising to be displayed in connection with search terms on the Internet, according to the findings of the lawsuit, which is Google’s core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Despite failing in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater causing the explosion
Grandma reportedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a faulty water heater, the King's attorney's surrogate said Friday night.
The expert dispatched to the site by the prosecutor's office assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and conditioned for a long time on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who went down to the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the OCMW.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of Les Arches intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to take oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of nomination, but his triumphal day is unlikely to mark the end of political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of nomination to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration at the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the 18 black-robed judges of the court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and harshly repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer on the new president and, standing out from the presidential splendour of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy through the busy streets connecting the city center to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “rescue wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has strengthened considerably since his victory and Friday’s speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun in the 2011 uprising against authoritarian President Mubarak.
“Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, addressing the judges in the woodworked hall where he took the oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he gave his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band who played the national anthem while he was on guard.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song “The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...” chanted by thousands of people gathered in the university’s grand amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and a former stronghold of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year began, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the US has slowed the rise of the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations has weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by automakers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit's three major automakers show double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated an average of 15.4 million sales at an annualized and seasonally adjusted pace, but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight setback is primarily due to "the government's shutdown and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fortnight of the month."
GM reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The Group’s four brands saw their sales performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickup trucks, saw sales grow 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower-than-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford sold 1.1%.
Renault hit the stock market by warning from Nissan
Renault on Friday saw the sharpest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had cut its forecast of annual net profit by nearly 20 percent, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a trading official for a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s shares and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of France, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by gunfire from two people on a motorcycle passing by a Golden Dawn neo-Nazi party premises in the western suburbs of Athens, police sources said.
The police were not yet able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards at their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Counter-terrorism police rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the leader and founder of the party, for participating in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Deported against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for hitting Neymar, the Scottish midfielder has seen his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households across the province are without electricity, shortly after noon Friday, due to strong winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers in the dark, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal area is also experiencing a lot of outages with nearly 7,000 homes deprived of electricity in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think that travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be reversing the trend.
The company has revised its net earnings forecast upwards and expects record results from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit over the entire year between $325 and $340 million before tax, against a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth from the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had started strong, particularly with regard to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire year before interest and tax deductions,” he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the United Kingdom, the leisure travel sector of Flight Centre performed well while business customers spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was weaker and was expected to make a year-over-year profit for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unknown men opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without making any casualties, the result of an apparent quarrel with redundant employees.
The attackers fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt receives almost no tourists since the army ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and bloodily suppresses the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of English Literature classes, students will have to study at least one play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be removed.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examination Regulatory Office, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence,” insisting that the GCSEs would be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the deeper math GCSE – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were coming from door to door to ask for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old told police he was scared.
His weapon was seized.
Former Gestapo Chief Buried in Jewish Cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without a trace ever being found, was actually buried in a mass grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he told the daily newspaper on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would answer one of the great riddles of the post-war era.
The German secret services, the BND, assured that in the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
"As of August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing "a general's uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were in particular his states of service with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from Berlin's Mitte district town hall stating that he was buried in the neighborhood's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by the revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an immensity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is roughly trampled with one's feet," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon’s villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him as “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his ailing father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a bruise that he was going to carry the aftermath of for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Bwelle said.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgeries for free over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas over the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after securing medical equipment on the roof and traversing difficult terrain to get to the villages that need help the most.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They often had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best housing available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses, or a free birth certificate – a necessary document to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall, or home; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to give his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an emotive rhythm, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical procedures for free over the past year, and they know that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical practices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, that finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s asleep,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle on his missions, it's a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help sprinkle the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Ms. O'Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearing extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Doubtless, but by highlighting its weakness for the traverse paths, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of other people's works in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
Certainly, but knowing that such a consecration cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has happened.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator, and federator of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The nasty tongues could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a keen eye and with erudition, but incurably dilettant.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago already established that the one who passed not to write had a lot and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, there is the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation set to leap as if on foot from one subject to another.
But it is soon understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocanteur back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
Here is a few, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
The accidents had to be unfolded, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is completely different.
He does not pose as heir to an eternal frankness, he refuses to define it.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders through a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
This one, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so permanently established within its borders, so formerly structured and solidly masonry, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are only so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, to ward off the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Burgundians, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in two.
Since the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without succeeding in denying it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more greedy for unity and indivisibility as it had cut off the head of the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of the French identity feel, nothing beats the four steps outside of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escapade could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinship only better emphasizes what is our own.
There were men who had left their old regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered by an old indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it sowed the drama and confided it.
There founding fathers always honored, and here revolutionary ancestors of whom it is hard to make models, and who have otherwise killed each other.
There an institutional constancy, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch up and attempts to resume.
The France that is leaving, the France that is coming
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could sew up the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was darkly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had a time.
Here it is again under debate, pushed by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of claiming minorities, absorbed into the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of the France that is leaving and the circumspect sketch of the France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, which should reserve some surprises.
It is discovered that the chimney was a housewife.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker stood in the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he will have finally done it.
Certainly in a less steep, more bursting and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, just as constraining.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Ghosts of the World", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the opportunity for hostages to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to reunite with their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Houses du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the set of 8 p.m. of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
Especially in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who are leading us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the site of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
The French take us to the French embassy.
It's the time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an unbelievable mess.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three TV channels.
I come back and there are plenty of them.
The descent from the flight staircase, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists pull themselves to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from getting up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest thing.
The same night, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that is a bit like a vacation.
How did the DGSE medical examinations and debriefing go?
I had a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-G<0xC3><0xA2>ce the days following my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not surrendered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage-takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
In particular, the debate on ransoms.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I try to divide things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Ghosts of the World" that allows me to put distance, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the hostage's legal status.
I think there is a semantic problem.
The hostage-taking must be described as a "political" hostage-taking - which is the case most of the time - and the hostages must be allowed access to justice, to lodge a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is set up for that.
Why shouldn’t the hostage-takers be told “you have violated the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, we’re going to bring you to justice”?
It seems to me, however, justified, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the Streets to Denounce Mursi Trial
Anger is raging in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the start of the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, says this Muslim Brotherhood activist.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial if a pro-Morsi rises, it is he who is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed outside the Cairo police academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to an ID card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it,” the minister said in an address to the Anti-Defamation League in New York.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" established on their territory, he denounced, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The sling of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on same-sex marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population involved in the recognition of same-sex marriage to be about 5,600 people active, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the aftermath, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, are already attending competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy of the Hyeres Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing so much as to show competitors that surpass him by three heads.
Toronto mayor chases journalists from questioning drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drug addiction, according to several media outlets.
A video handed over to the court seems to support these suspicions.
The interested Rob Ford has always denied using crack, while acknowledging he has a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he evicted several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images need no explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and support people who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
“Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified” and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries are now calling on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on a skin injured by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
“Being free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not unscathed,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture specifies that the last "autochthonous" case of rabies identified dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from the Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time," the ministry said, and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama is stepping back on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days, accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with the right health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a buzz in the news" about the terminations, President Obama has incited Americans who were receiving the notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better suited health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should come as no surprise if the 5% of the population who self-insured are forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius told the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace in October had failed "unfortunately".
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her microcoupe, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday’s Assembly session following an exchange of contentious views with Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri, about whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Mrs. Sebelius why the Affordable Care Act “architect” hadn’t voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to take out a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel launches special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky elect, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 World Champion, on Friday released a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for free trials at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Vettel has chosen from among 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his booth.
Vettel had to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, destined to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Let us not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only aimed at suburban residents.
I chose a map of France as the logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native town of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My first proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even if he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported locally Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them, too.
It is only extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme -consultable on the Internet- from many themes supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and in particular to the young: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of custodian of buildings...
There remains to be candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political stage."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he acknowledges."
It is a problem of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails that I have received since yesterday do not all come from suburban areas," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage “has gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.S.' defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions espionage "has gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “automatic pilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities emerged.
The leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government learned about certain things in autopilot mode because we had the opportunity to do so, from the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he was now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one would feel mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to be blown up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
In the meantime, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made about a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the sense of frustration aroused by the National Security Agency's surveillance.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay with us in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s subcommittee on European affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some of the U.S. allies, however the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations have revealed documents released by Snowden that the NSA intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy said his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators are expected to be released in the coming days.
He said the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “loving firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world who spy,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry plans to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the grudge generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plagued by Shell's poor results and the day after the Fed announced it would continue to support the economy as expected.
Australian woman appeals her prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before they confessed to making up the story.
She was detained in a cell of the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women’s prison.
It is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who has called on the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We’ve obviously had a harrowing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith, Thailand may also seek to restore its deteriorated image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will arrest the fans of Anderlecht who came differently than with the RSCA buses
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman of the Brussels-midi police zone, Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to carry out arrests or even police officers," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff, to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French".
Vision Diversity has been walking schools for the past year to help students of all backgrounds discover common benchmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of origin or they came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” says Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has created a research centre that will provide tools for teachers who, at times, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different pedagogical strategies, that's the real need," she summarizes.
Research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
