The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
Preliminary results show that the early parliamentary elections in Austria have led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current grand coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the main political force in the country, nevertheless, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; notably for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
But the voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations about the possible resignation of the party leader and current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party’s leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the way to the outcome of the election that remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large coalition SPÖ and ÖVP.
Nevertheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populistsUnion (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ's part was a European one.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he plans to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently bets on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crosses the four-percent limit and does not gain access to parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool down
If the issue of Czech researchers accused of illegally collecting cockroaches in India could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, a certain cooling in Czech-Indian relations would result.
The minister said it today in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which was carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee says, after the talks, that the executive power could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was discharged from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He could then ask for bail and await a free trial, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed, that his partner spoke in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them also by India.
Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that goes on for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he stressed before his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
“We regard the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech researchers as a great contempt,” he said.
The minister avoided the question of whether he had received a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czechman Referees the Struggle for the Seabed
It is approaching a wall-mounted electronic map, depicting Australia and adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
This area is as big as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Oceans and Law of the Sea Division.
Its leader, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The ardor at work and the enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
There are petroleum, minerals and other mineral resources, but also currently unknown living organisms, which may hold the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider bottom than the hard land
Coastal states nowadays have begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed making use of their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
The latter may, according to the Convention, exclusively claim all resources of the continental shelf.
To simplify, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," Mikulka explains.
The country's request to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly prospecting and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five applications, including those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently seen a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed assigned to it by the commission last week corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The future benefits they will derive from the exploitation of the seabed will be, as they project it, invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the “Montego Bay Convention.”
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the zone of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "the common heritage of humanity".
There no longer does any state enjoy an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let's not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said director Mikulka, exaggerating that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former bloc of the Eastern countries within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" by the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is turbulent, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a concretion.
It is reminiscent of a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German Special Forces were on the scene for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany for the resolution of the hostage crisis - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready but never took action.
More and more details about the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, specialists from the Federal Army as well as officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technischen Hilfwerk were at the site of liberation.
As the spokesperson for the ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were ultimately not required, the hostage-takers having freed their prisoners and having fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government has reportedly accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had kidnapped a group of tourists in southern Egypt consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transbahturated into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers has remained vague until now, as have details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five holidaymakers and special forces are expected to have taken off aboard an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout plan.
The Dow Jones was falling into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout in favor of the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to curb the chaos of the financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic move, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called on MPs to vote in favour although the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state bailout plan could hoodwink.
It went up shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into effect, approval and of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
When it comes to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded revenues of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as entrusted to Berlin on Monday by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures are already dominating the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyses monthly booking data from 1,200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar price, trips to the US would be particularly in demand, said the DRV.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one Third.
Apart from this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Organized trips in particular are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily computable for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very tightly held back so that an increase in sales figures will be recorded again compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
Ballermann or Apres-Ski hits, beer in liter pitchers and celebrities in designer Tyrolean costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailored Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to achieve its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst Equator, my sense of well-being in traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in the place Thérèse, everything is half worse.
Each or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blasted or ashamed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit harvests some bizarre eyebrows at the banana-shock stand.
A Bavarian woman pointed out to me that I would have tied my apron wrong: "on the left means free, in the middle virgin, on the right cased, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I trim my loop from the back to the left.
“It’s better,” she says and laughs.
Others don't give themselves as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes us their nude back-train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time to the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous", with an ooooo elongated.
He tells me all this after he relieved himself of the beak he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a trash can.
Bob is one of those infamous "wild trackers".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, swarms of rescue workers run to the festival square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered in tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer festival: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunken under the tarp are not visible.
“These are the ones who can no longer swallow anything,” one of the rescuers shouts at me in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon’s city crash on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, where she died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of his fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is placed on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, as some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retarded to the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the forces of the empire advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to underline the widening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitments policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a sleeping car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 and a half hours, shaken on noisy rails whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built of stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and many bakeries in which middle managers in suit-tie-men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
“The aim of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
“But at some point, I asked if ‘Isn’t Turkey supposed to choose?’
“Turkey,” he said, “does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I have been able to talk to has recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another sleepless night, I thought about these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey had been called "the sick of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs by Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died 9/11) was head of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod used to repeat to us, “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be named a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them have ever disappointed me - and sometimes they have even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, “focus only on certain people.”
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 he became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, MA and PhD".
This is from the Woodruff author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but it's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second assault for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
Added to this are a few refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line-up to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was launched on the market.
First of all, Honda has refurbished this model in a shorter timeframe than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, nearly one million Honda Jazz cars have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with about a million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a growth of sales of 17% in the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary expects to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the fall in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand’s managers hope to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, that is, 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to achieve a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of the Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is expected in the first three months of next year, following its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change either 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and so is the interior space.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of gasoline in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the trunk capacity – which has a double-bottom system – can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is the improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre gasoline propellants.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propellant, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L 100 horsepower has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have made this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan safety shield.
This robot will allow the vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space with an oval shape that closely resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But most important are the bee's compound eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is known as a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
“At the moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by forking its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory for Displacement and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted upwards or downwards, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device only needs to process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, which is why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in series cars in a decade or so after Nissan.
The robot runs on lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of cash to make plans, is not devoid of geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn how not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's 'The Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more of a teenage game.
What to do if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has also announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s leading bank, which will pay $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a news item greeted by a sharp decline in its stock market price.
A week after releasing an interim deal, the two banks said MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The selected price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global deal would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new status last week, which should allow it to diversify its business but put it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been changed in the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, “we thought the stake would be entirely made up of common shares.
But given the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into common stock within a year if the latter are traded more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at about $47, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group, however, declined to elaborate on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "deeply" eased its balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock market price melt in half as the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt soared.
The cost fell on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted outside the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a wide victory of "yes", ranging between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution in the night of Sunday to Monday.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place calmly according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, dealt with a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly of the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Supported by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants enhanced powers to the head of state, who will be able to hold up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will run for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also foresees a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad.
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at around 3.30 p.m. on a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in “good health,” and “no ransom has been paid” to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the edge of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been tossed from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official who requested anonymity.
He said 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning unit" had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied paying a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
Oh, that's good.
But one area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that die of hunger?
What politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 historical, heritage, archival and genealogical societies are concerned with excavating history, preserving with three under heaps of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
It is they, often, who are the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When will it be a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European bank in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries support, in the amount of 11.2 billion euros, this financial and insurance institution also owns interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been widening for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In line with the decision on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (to 49%) of the bank’s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, including, first and foremost, the insurance business, which it acquired last year from the Dutch company ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis stocks began a dizzying decline, and in the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too big to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company’s shares fell 12 percent to their lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the company's executives, is not realistic.
The company's management blames the uncertainty across the Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US bailout plan of $700 billion, to be the cause of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Earlier, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agencies were stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about his or her drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become out of control.
"There are data protection programmes that link the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in any case, with the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it amounts to entrusting his henhouse to a fox," Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of damage, on the state of health of the client that occurs, and if they feel that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates for a medical examination, and they did not sign an insurance contract with them until they became aware of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided from pharmacies, data about the person's drug purchases in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his health condition.
For example, if that person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol-lowering, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine a risk factor at the same time, so there is not much left to do for the insurer apart from paperwork. However, tiny problems may still appear.
Disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is seen by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data. They must seek permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug consumption to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the circle of control of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the sole agreement of the data subject.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her consent or not, since if he or she refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus, and ultimately, the hens depend on the fox’s benevolence.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be discussed.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic great power that should be given a broader right to speak in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday, at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double the number of trades, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an over-ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civilian flights, so that air traffic can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's main trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan was strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on this issue was raised.
The completion of the Doha business cycle has also been called for, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate agenda, including that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic materials by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need for a global market at next year’s climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The head of state of India travels to the French capital today, where during a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the news agency, the deal will last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Room Struktur, at Butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular, in relation to that for adults and children.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of the plane of Steve Fosset, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a plateau 3,000 metres above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared.”
The sheriff said no human remains were found on or near the plane.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) reported that a few hours after the wreck was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset’s personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had traveled around the world by plane and non-stop.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters in height, in the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the latest off-road "compact" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Thanks to its exceptional, unexpected and unconventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
Thus the hype that will accompany the beginning of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented modality of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan shopping, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication includes the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that when looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Eliminata8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then reconstituted into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers with this formula? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group " Ultras Italy" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
Nor had he ever encountered the tifosi opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their hometown appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed so they could not be identified.
They are inspired by English typography.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoon of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been forbidden to attend a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and then will take measures: in this case, it could be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is to say, others risk adding to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which are dealing precisely with stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched out during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
This is the opinion (really not pleasantly expressed) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria to praise Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 typhoids was shameful.
“I am not a sociologist,” the Observatory’s No. 1 adds, “crimes must be attributed in the country in which the event occurs.
Until now, this group had stayed by the rules, now we will see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about whistles to Mameli’s anthem: these too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite.
