Populist right-wing triumph in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing his triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, so it loses 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the OVP has finished losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic, results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the post-war period and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved on Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path of the constant and closer starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the fact that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the liberals (FPO) have gained about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the Union would repeat the same from the year 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit to the BZ government, but in the year 2005 the BZ government was one by one).
Haider, who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he already assumes his return to Vienna, to national politics, is clearly betting on this evolution.
The Green Party has also managed to reach the parliament although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four percent limit and is therefore not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India May Cool
If it is not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, it could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This is what the minister said in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then this cooling would certainly be achieved," he said after the meeting, which was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get into legal matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was exempt from charge and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling whose jurisdiction falls under the matter.
"Your problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest authorities.
He can then request the acquittal of the case and wait for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague spoke in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the High Court and then a pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the convicted person “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already obtained by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, before his colleague, he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it a trembling mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister circumvented the answer to the question of whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would deal with the matter.
“I’ve received a lot of promises,” he said.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, depicting Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and next to it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the team of thirty members working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
Its chief, director of the Division, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
It can be found oil and other mineral raw materials, but also unknown organisms to date that themselves carry the key to the development of anti-cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the mainland
Coastal countries have today begun to vigorously contest new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called continental border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the Treaty, it has exclusive rights in all resources of the Continental Rim.
"Simply, by Continental Border is meant the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the limit of the sea coast, and often the border of two hundred sea miles, that is, pure economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental border, must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have moved forward,” Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
However, New Zealand has also achieved it - the seabed surface that the commission awarded it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The gain that will be derived from the use of the seabed will, as promised, be invaluable.
Other states are also slowly submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
Where the continental border ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as a "common heritage of humanity".
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
“The seafloor, however, is no gold mine,” says director Mikulka emphatically, adding “that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as well as a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the ability to operate in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something larger than former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
“A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” added Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian Division employee, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was in the place of action
To resolve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being learned about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation also participated indirectly the German special forces.
Thus at the liberation site were specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, of the Federal Criminal Investigation Office as well as experts in the field of logistics of the technical charity.
As ministry spokespersons reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted help from Germany to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that time didn't come," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, the attackers had kidnapped a group of travelers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian woman and her 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the saved and healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He said no word about the details of the liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return in Airbus of the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives does not approve the package of salvation
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed a large $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell drastically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s package for saving financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote, although the plan is not as popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t quite happened yet,” he said.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state bailout package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order to allow the program into effect, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the desire of the Germans to travel remains as before.
As reported Monday by the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to the research of the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already risen in number.
Thus the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis of the results are GfK figures which are the information analyzed on reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed for approximately the entire market.
The data collected are travel reservations made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weakened course of the dollar especially trips to the United States are in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are very preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are rising, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months the trips were well booked, so that the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The party hits under the open sky at the Endless Spa, the beer in one-litre jugs and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, the moderator on television and wears a traditional Bavarian tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially because I am first at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costumes seem to fulfill their function.
Actually as a tourist at the Oktoberfest coming from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa everything is not for so much.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; neither seems to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A Munich girl draws my attention to my apron that was dressed in the wrong way: "the left side is single, half is the virgin, on the right side is engaged, behind is widow."
Oh, God, now I'm locked up from behind to the left.
“All right,” he says with a laugh.
The others do not care about many subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it is written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is named Bob, is from England and is also at Oktoberfest for the first time.
To him it seems "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "o".
He tells me after putting next to him his glass of a liter of beer he just drank.
Put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that's a trash can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume as much alcohol.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, groups of sanitizers run around the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear every time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered walkways from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They come sober, they come back drunk.
You can't see who suffers from the degrees of alcoholemia and is on the steps.
“They’re the ones who ‘can’t do it anymore,’ a sanitarian answered my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died at the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road in the town of Brentwood was involved in the crash on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Diplomatic Horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set at the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit decaying.
But once the vaulted locker was over, there is no doubt what the grandeur of the company was that this was the westernmost door.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a “latecomer” in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that cured to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Because of the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen frontiers of the Cold War, it fell under
When the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has decayed and remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party in the government - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of jolts, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived at the Turkish capital - new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This has aroused some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping malls and "power pastries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is to re-integrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
You have to do both.
“But surely at some point,” I ask, “Could Turkey be forced to choose?”
"Turkey," he replies, "does not want to offend that choice."
He then underlines a point that almost everyone I have spoken to so far has recited to me almost in memory: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those rail lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts go back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in Turkey’s hands today?
And waiting at the terminal the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is not much doubt on which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its ending in 1979, several of us were ending our 20s - we just refused to give it up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, whether unaccompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Often Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
You just have to sing!”
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never taxable, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical outburst, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that never, by any, have I been disappointed – otherwise, I have often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known warhorses around the world."
We'll be missing a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25) you state that "in 1946 he resumed economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he won a research fellowship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned from a note by Woodruff’s author in Beyond Nab End, but it’s not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
I was attracted by their simplicity and the strength they transmit, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second round for Honda's bestseller
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution versus Revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model it must be commented that this new Jazz arrives six years after the introduction of the first generation on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case of Japan, where the Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
In Japan, more than a million units of Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz allow to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm marketed a total of 83,000 units of the Jazz, in 2009 the estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a growth of 17% in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary expects to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda is relying on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door, compact-sized hybrid - 4.37 meters in length - that the Japanese company expects to market nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will occur in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in partnership in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new Jazz is growing in all its dimensions.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Alongside the increase in dimensions, interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the trunk capacity - which has a double bottom system - amounts to 399 liters, 19 liters more of the first generation trunk capacity.
It should be noted that these measurements are of the version with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will have two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre gasoline engines.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine gets a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 revolutions.
This propellant - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has an output of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
As for the previous propellant, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horsepower, now has 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horsepower achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that prevents collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of Public Relations for Brand Management Technology and Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s compound eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object, and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately translates into collision prevention.
“The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at right or greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is entirely instinctive.
If it weren’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deflect upwards or downwards, or diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes.”
This is the first step towards developing new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology Nissan predicts will be introduced into production cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
Shake before you mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created a fun and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
In other words, the Hotel of Bad Credits... or of Troubles.
The terrifying aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
Certainly it has useful information, but little detailed.
It’s more a page for teenagers than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house...
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its public offering.
A week after they discovered an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 percent of the Morgan Stanley common shares at the price per unit of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a 10% return and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said Juan Mack, the group’s chief executive officer.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to behave much more cautiously than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for almost $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s chief executive, explained in Tokyo, “we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below its book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into common stock within one year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or so, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says MUFG’s capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group declined, however, to give clarification on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to show a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had greatly eased his balance since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market price drop in half as the cost of securing against a risk of defects on its debt took off.
This cost declined last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
To refound the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third to put to the vote a draft for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were void votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls outside the polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad “yes” victory, estimating it to between 63 percent and 70 percent.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night of Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The “Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in complete calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a 444-point text consolidating the " new socialism " advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution entails increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving for it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies sent by its emigrants.
Taken by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who can hold up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and would seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will terminate the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good on their arrival at 3.30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft to the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the hijackers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since gone from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptus, in charge of the organization of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"An exchange of gunfire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled," said this official who kept the anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they had the support of German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of our men of the secret services, of the special forces," he said without going into details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an off-roader on board with the kidnappers, of whom it killed six, including the Chadian commander and detained two.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
Better like that.
But one part of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concert.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec Societies of History, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with little money piles of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 billion euros this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Head of Economic Competition.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves more than a year ago, so the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense, can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision taken early on Sunday, the three states will buy about half (49 percent) of the Bank’s property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its business, including mainly the activities -mainly insurance - bought last year by the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and for the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company's shares declined 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest in 14 years.
Since January, the value of shares has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management blamed the sharp drop in Fortis shares on the insecurities of the U.S. market in relation to the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, the shares showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they didn’t have to worry, they won’t lose their money.
There has been no panic among the Bank’s clients so far, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken coop
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see drug purchase data.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the personal data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the prescriptions in all cases binds it to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we trust the chicken coop to the fox" - quotes the Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescriptions follow-up program.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation depend on the customer’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the result of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of medications bought in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the client's illnesses and health status.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the blood fat level is practically incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration has hardly anything to do, although there are small difficulties about it.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some drugs are multi-purpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headaches and for heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk factor for insurance companies while the former does not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already forcing them to do so, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies have also been developing laboratory test results and combining them with drug consumption data to provide more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and at the same time it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that gives the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the individual for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, in spite of everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue, in addition to the other mostly global problems, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, to deal mainly with nuclear energy cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to come up with a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit that began yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of the European Union, José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission and Javier Solana, the main representative of foreign policy, welcomed Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double in five years, i.e. increase their trade to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious target.
Thus, the existing twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally harmonized, so that air transport could also fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU’s trading partners.
The summit focused its attention on global issues.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, that is, by 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, just as next year’s climate conference should reach a global agreement and reduce production of greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wished to hinder rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian editors
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international Frankfurt book show.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book expects for this edition more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the inauguration ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
There will be a meeting with the stamp in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of the publishers in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the missing millionaire on September 3, 2007, have been found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris has been found on an altiplano at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the area of the Nevada Mountains of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
"The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have it confirmed that it is proper to what Steve Fossett was flying over on the day of his disappearance," he said in a print conference.
The commissioner said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was reported dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Transportation Safety (NTSB) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the wreckage, a team of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal remains have been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with the name Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the spin of the world in a hot air balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later, he had made the round of the world by plane and without stopovers.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters in height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemas with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Proper for the content outside of the traditional, will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of the Milan shopping mall, avenue Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue As it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, by looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be reconstituted into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will you be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula? we will see.
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that the Italian National has been following for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (ban on access to sports events) at that time, none who had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, were refused the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior hopes to read the actions that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents attending not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't stand any more in a stadium.
Thank you!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others are added.
"We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way," the interior ministry said.
That's why, "eyes wide open" especially in view of Wednesday's National game in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams can also count on a section of the Aise (information agency and external security, that is, the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the Mameli hymn? In Bulgaria it is not a reato ...".
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of public safety in Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not reluctant to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
“I don’t do the sociologist,” adds the Observatory’s No.1, “reacts are attributed in the countries where the event takes place.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will consider it for the future.
But let us also speak of the whistles to Mameli’s hymn: even those are not a retort, but if they allow, they are also not of education.
