The UKIP survivors who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You’re talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn’t be used to pay for those who come to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who uses specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing insanes, is virtually non-existent.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel does not constitute evidence.
So, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
Nor do you know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence surprised me a lot, but only because this problem is so rarely discussed.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're going to have to be able to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely talked about because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Eventually, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
To expect almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
We were praised by Ireland, the 'Tiger of Europe', a few years ago.
We knew the sequel!
It starts to read the article again.
There is an attempt to make it appear that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC WONDER'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients nothing to ''pavoise'' at the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the eighties of the twentieth century, the irlance was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with Portugal Considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development was not a long, quiet river, it is safe in view of the recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the tax policies actually paid by the multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full price.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars on every street corner, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily corks since coming back.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon catch on.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a crash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe that Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on either of those two once they've been refurbished.
That would be the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay an extra fee for the additional fear they were kindly given?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair in the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay for something other than the basic fare just have to take it on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether we will have to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was a mistake by the airport’s air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Bon voyage
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowds.
People do not come en masse for the quality of the restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the Salon de la revue at the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% tourists.
<0x40>aloes False!
The only argument that would seem admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover every year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows prices to fall .
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy nor, moreover, the minister in charge of foreign affairs have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
While they're locking it up.
What's the use of the law?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my grandchildren to the municipal library.
In my city of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he has tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he has tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some not terrible.
Probably his estate would want his share of the cake, if you give me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for 5 years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other government aristos who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very cleverly won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium, and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure works are by definition not very renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they reflect well the real evil francai:s the mistrust towards the dialogue
Return to Princep values.
Unemployment insurance reform is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his help, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on income from his properties.
It is necessary to differentiate between the one who invests for a return to retirement and the one who lives on his annuities.
One property to rent or even two for a couple on top, it's vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of great infrastructure shortages.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so a new deal could not be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage and therefore brutal degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is soaring: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage, etc...
A tax that promotes high incomes and annuities.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is a gallop.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have appealed to buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for “a better platform.”
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our interest for all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it wasn’t an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting against ideas and not against men (on the contrary, on Parisian fools) could tell us which author(s) they are fighting against ideas about gender and indicate to us the works they intend to fight against.
Or are they just tackling the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart, cultured person.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holofernes, rapprochement that hadn't come to me (I don't have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "background", since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwards, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid of the world?
What do we fear those who are afraid of?
Furasato and <0x40> give us some answers.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second in calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate at home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate on the idea.
It's something else, much deeper.
<0x40> Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: When it comes to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only statement made by their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, that's the whole difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to the vows of Lo.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat compensated for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really enclose the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will return it to its true color as soon as possible.
It obsesses you, doesn't it?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover up for the whole week of the Perseid meteor shower and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I am beginning to think that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a TAX on this eclipse.
Anyone watching this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last thought before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (forcefully) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Superb photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars will collide with Earth.
There is nothing to market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultraliberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so that we can make an opinion.
Today, Tuesday, October 15, see the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at the lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
However, these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a demand for compensation in the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of the Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What if there is an error in the Ministry of the Economy?
Will the decision makers who have gained the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL....
<0x40>lol No the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the life span of its members.
In addition, unless government spending is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that will ensure future growth and therefore future revenues.
A few elements of answer.
An unfortunate decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of the global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth doesn’t match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by law as written by policy.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgery, safe shoot rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money from drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Since the Liberals want our health care system to resemble that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been misformed to blame the Toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize business profits and “research.”
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or prescription-only.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for cancer pain, despite the laws that curb them and the expensive permits needed.
While manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy with the use of alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a manager of this hospital.
We can't hold patents on grass...
If “researchers” in the social sciences did research instead of doing politics and networking, one could be using their “work”.
A researcher does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy, not research.
We cannot say "research is done, it must be applied" and then in the same jet "it must be experimented at all times".
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research isn't done, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a will to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice reread the paragraph on the internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training system.
Education theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
To give more weight to education theorists would be to destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally misleading: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of fighting copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn’t he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty for violating copyright, I will just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It is the same since they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without the proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can still debate pedantic hypotheses - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty for violating copyright
Obviously you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon all intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they passed with one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a buddy on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we are full of, the grief that says everything is going wrong....
If it is a PS member who says it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
I have always worked in a private company.
I have had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know that I do not have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to shoot red bullets on the null bosses that I frequently meet.
Comfortably in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small companies - What do French bosses expect to do the same?
Is the state holding their hand?
This state that they accuse of imperity?
<0x40>Jacques L.
Always this anti-business verse from you!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat, I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are buzzing and undermining while waiting for permanent state assistance!
It's terrible.
But they have solutions: abolishing the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their suppression!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
This is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I'm from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I've tried to get them recently, but I haven't succeeded.
But, well, Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing stopping people in the UK from creating a more moral enterprise and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally overturned.
MTR, a Hong Kong-based company, won the Crossrail operating contract for eight years.
Well Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for pooling and sharing and believes that workers should all help each other across borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps this is because the management of the Dutch is on good track while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a battling girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that the fact of being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with the fact of surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", which are no less dead, I know some of them.
Getting out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again, too.
I'm not telling you that this is the condition to manage, I'm telling you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
As for the examples of your life, it is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have merit in coming out of a disease or that one can deserve not to come out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think the opposite, if, having a solid morale probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatment and to prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is beating in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord" it's something else.
Not with merit or courage.
These considerations are peculiar to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I caught two, dirt, big ones, and if I "batted" as these fine psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of squeezing the teeth, suffering the hell and taking the blows.
I thought the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the MODERN rule of international law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed that same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the western compressor roller.
Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed independence and was promptly recognized by Western states who then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not understanding the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world at the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of research is indisputably useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus that would be "the smallest and coldest planet to have detectable water molecules," according to a study led by Drake Fraland's University of Mary and Jonathan's team.
The method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Passeur de sciences for delighting us, often, of these experimental prowess that are accomplished in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odorless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we have no reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on arte recounting the struggle of two scientific teams, one in California and the other in Japan, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly their modification before an earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but I was convinced by their hypotheses.
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this trail?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we come across the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely in circles.
I don't understand that we can think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to make fun of it with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep a single one.
It just underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was on “Have I Got News for You.”
Because he's a celebrity and people have been inculcated in celebrity worship.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will fall the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one of them.
That's exactly what they said about Londoners.
He should have brought his friend with him, smarter than he was.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read a few books (there are, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Solomons” and the “Strait of Scrap” speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who remained there.
It is understandable that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just look through the list of sponsors and philanthropists.
One more com operation neither done nor done.
The cow, it makes you want too much!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recitation makes me revisit, by identifying myself a little while on the way (I also learned how to sail with the Crocos of L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers!
Peter, from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think that the red hat that has demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes to fund the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
It's Bisevac the Lyon defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as a striker on Velez's great team, which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had statures such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal teammate of Arsène Wenger, Boro).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *smile*
Now, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he is not the holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" to see two towers collapse knowing that women, men and unquestionably children are inside?
How???
What annoys me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact of having been able, even once, to rejoice spontaneously in the horrible death of thousands of people, in my eyes bears witness to a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Probably in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically do evil to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been gnawed at by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic damage pleasure.
We knew a little bit.
The “Christian/White/Gaulian” West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, and hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigoted conservatism of the powers in place and the fascistic nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
If we have understood this before, we must not push back Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes out, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of dying.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a great summer this year, don't make your grumpy clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to the germs from the outside, it may change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, snow risks and lots of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child surcharges, it is the amount collected by the State that mainly comes from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the share of widows is not at all covered in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we are not on the straw, but thinkers
For once the PS makes a rather leftist policy we are not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue this way and you will encourage those 20% to work less or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OICs recycled to the PS: they have understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to amass as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is used only to make money, that is to say, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Probably also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
Fair taxation should allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or even lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if we have a social housing .
The utopias of the red Khmer head cutters have happily lived.
I have done two AirBnB in Norway recently.
It's no problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any hassle.
Just go to someone's house, sleep in it, put it behind you and leave.
This will be my first choice when I’m traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of homeowner insurance.
Be sure to use a service with the right logo!
Oh, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, that’s not true.
You just really missed luck.
From the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel, and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m planning to pay a down payment and a month of rent at once but I’m a little afraid to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," sang the Bu$herie in every tone...
Inoffensive weapons.
I am sure it will please the families and loved ones of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We all agree.
Do you think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And let's not be led to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office at the college / high school to its teachers so they boss at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
By the way, it's so much the hideout at 5pm a week and 4 months of holidays that we can't fill the CAPES with maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to coltinate with poorly educated bastards whose parents spit on you by calling you a jerk?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadis so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
The Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid an extra <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 a year and they weren't even applying for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don’t worry if you can’t find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed at graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan.
I don't like working in a company so I hope to eventually move into either the public service or academia.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of career paths such as art/letters/theatre/media/philosophy/political sciences, i.e. what are called unemployed degrees.
I have one of those diplomas and I finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but we quickly raise the ranks because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / artistic fields have been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve every problem, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in ways that get results.
Are Letters, Philosophy and Art a Way of Life?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about the media study kind degrees or whatever abscene course you've been in.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better for a real territorial policy to decongest Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I can hardly see the inhabitants of the bottom of Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km round-trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belt residents already have many means of public transport that are much more convenient (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much so that they benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for ONE bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not right at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of public transport it is not the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1 / it is hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that speed up and do not care about the survival of the bikes 2 / we take full pollution in the head For me the bags and the motorbikes have to piss zone
Bicycle paths are apartheid, it is necessary to live together but to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in big Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bicycle in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% velo travel is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, after what OR reports, the EELV assistants seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find out who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world is changing.
Looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other planes had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching airstrikes against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay the overflight fees of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurper government/the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine – and who want to show roughly that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The previous: a 1986 International Court of Justice ruling that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, investigators have not said anything like that.
Calling yourself Ricardo and being such an eco-beotian is distressing!
Calling yourself Polar is losing the north is enjoyable.
Only one question of the Beotian: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I cannot help noticing that those who criticize Piketty’s book the most virulently have not read it!
It's easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequality of labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today coincides with that of the beginning of the 20° before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limitations.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis that has been given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, we can debate it without having read the book whose main thing is to argue in one direction in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of its pavement summarized by the press false?
I have not read and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this that seems to me pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a bit strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colorful perverts”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he advocates equal rights for women.
It is, and always has been, for her to receive a higher education and for her to have the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, insofar as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at age 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years old.
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who obviously has a little trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich dummy character.
I just watched the last two seasons which are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to have all of a sudden than to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it is above all the risks of staging and editing that struck me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicules the asepticization of today's productions.
I can't wait to see you throwing the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even being able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from technical qualities.
Well, I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end like 24 hours what?
Everyone does what they want!
It is by what I say “I will not look after” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view, nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she will be fatal to her.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - rather coupons in government spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to sabre in spending failed.
Unleash controversy over relatively small spending items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to be calling for, and all the while some on each side are pretending that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
“Debt” is assets held primarily by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem if the government appropriated a third of my income (before I even talked about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to be used wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage wasn’t quite honest about how to cut taxes but well, if you add up our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to roughly useless wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come up with a figure that makes the tax on Labour more ridiculous--and the Lib.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car sticker.
I get paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for a job at the door-to-door prove this?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not search, it means that 80% search and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have a better interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs increases my chances that much.
Actually, I haven't heard from P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi in months, does that mean that the agents are more busy with checks operations than they are really getting job advertisements in?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then it is necessary to do without Pole Emploi.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport for their transport ticket, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one screams scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times that I have had to deal with P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi, my rights at the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amplified by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Enrollment and control is taking precedence at present, while by statute P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Politicians and French non-employees are granting themselves rights that they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valorization of wage labour.
More than waiting for murderous tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this area of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Death in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis have had the presence of the spirit of banning this year's Hajj in Mecca to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope that the rest of the world will have the same presence of spirit.
Is it heartless to offer to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was common sense, but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put into strict quarantine.
No one comes out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they get the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's stop them from offering to fly to those countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
That he succeeds in passing on the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he will be able to dogmaize the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the functioning planet.
It is still far from that conception.
It has only been 20 years since information emerged as humanity's given premium, while religion, born from the cerebellum, may have been directing our actions since Lucy.
What's the point of becoming an nth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would in any case not set foot to the Church, it is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will reach more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you envisaged pre-existed with Christ.
A century before, Hillel said, "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is all the Torah and the rest is nothing but commentary: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "promote justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
You can't make it up.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll check it out.
Obviously not at work.
The computer department's jewel flaps block all the cool sites.
Hello, is that <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Please note: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card.
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the intended area.

So, was France in 1940 a “putrid earth”?
So this Nobel Prize seems like a poisonous gift to me.
Must we love the France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, you don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, which is already hard to read in French and describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to date Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Greetings to the awful ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer of Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hatred?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was borderline.
I was able to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people out there, there weren’t just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a friend to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope that if I turn 95, I will be as vivid as him.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you are moving a little bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids quests for the jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
It promptly reports arms trafficking.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or we have eyes wide closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, representative organizations or associations, Muslim or non-Muslim, who have formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or non-Muslim, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who doesn't say the word consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs, or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
In my view, this principle is the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the disintegration of French society.
If there is no doubt, say so.
Who does not say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to proximity to ISIS or condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "take revenge" on the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has widened between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a damn about Scotland since they don't have a seat there.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promise" thinking that he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leaders accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's rather what matters.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and she did it well.
Yet, he is still in the running to be prime minister in 2015, ever since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The Life of Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.

Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of pirated files, books in the public domain or bought from some publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without handkerchief.

There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country appears to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids on acid.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad as it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation there or whether it was merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises us is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to detail rather than to the c*nneries swung by the traditional media. The short article you give the link to is important and should be read with in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings from Iran to propose from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the bottom and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one on my mind.
A Nuremberg trial would be needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should it be “needed”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being still alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, huh?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate which planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a paupered place in Central Asia around the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, one seeks in vain contact with the real.
All clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the womb of a surrogate mother.

GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It doesn't date today.
Many women carried and gave birth to children who were not of their husbands.
It's still like that, we're made like that...
The important thing in this matter is that this practice be framed so that the "commercialization" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics aren’t they also commodification of bodies?!
Anachronic color unit ...
It is certainly more elegant to get a good woman in a distant country through the internet and Pay Pal than to accept her responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all the rooftops! ...
These practices were also not done in the name of the church! ...
It is not just Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don’t know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reporting that truly reflects the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder Paul Mason grasped the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will once again play soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at the Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a little well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped Newsnight.

Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (in fact, that was also the case for Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock and went into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative rose up in anger and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian (UN) representative smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower their guard.
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report...
And this has always been the case since politics became globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it lasts!
For the creation of Israel, you will not answer.
What is the relationship of strength that allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power today!
Do you doubt it?!!!
Plus, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist balleveses written by no others.
This proves that you do not understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horripiles some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the nonsense of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather cross arms to the locals and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he's published thoroughly, it says that to govern the political parties only slightly every 5 years for the Labour or the Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and to limit the democratic engagement of the multi-national people to that is completely useless.
I’m not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in submitting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are vanguards who will change their minds better if they really risk losing the elections), but it’s raging to see all those condescending answers that say that this idiot who doesn’t blame Jesus is just taking his pains.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be nice if people debated what he is actually saying rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote was completely distorted.
The uselessness of slipping a ballot paper into a ballot box every 5 years irritates me deeply since my vote really doesn’t count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their constituents.
Also, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand's remarks are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even if these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label “pseudo-chomskyist balletheads.”
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the nods of the head added to the montage!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him into his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to go.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the mainstream media — including the Guardian — for generations.
This "sling" reveals to me above all that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of History where trade historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on those scapegoats who are the keystone of their thinking.
For Foucault, I believe that the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is part of a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem of the relationship to the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist slope, neo-lib and/or libertarian (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to go to seek the state's help for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that beautifully self-organizes.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Not even a supporter.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chuya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology for Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet reflects deeply on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities scholars who can't stand the passage of allegiance to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn’t have the pleasure of hearing from our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them making violent anti-White remarks.
My dad's not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
As I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two in my life (including one abroad), haven't kept bad memories of them, all the people are worth each other and, in fact, those in London were very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise we do not remember who we meet, all people are worth each other, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked to the left as the union of the magistracy...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly branded right.
As for the Magistracy Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the application of the laws in the courts, it orders two obstacles to be ruled out.
That of the political view of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It then remains the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-observance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including the prosecutor's office, forces a distinction to be made between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics implicitly revealing that it starts from very low.
The previous preamble makes it possible to write the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area in question is that of the robbery* of heirs committed by means of fraudulent proceedings* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession gets good and bad 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a portion was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this coincides with the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, is that the judicial institution produced, during many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be robbed, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all the laws favorable to the heirs.
Is the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria not then an elaborate form of lying?
Absolutely prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and cumbersome tires, could.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks Epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price in a bike, so “you see”.
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know we need.
We can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, this is just a draft, it is not planned to be manufactured.
I'm CONTENT that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't come on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this fucking thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombing of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half of them are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation too, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects are diverting a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh that's not wood tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been imprisoned in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whoever you know) excluded him!
Do not forget also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built on the back of the population that has chosen its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing, not-for-profit economy.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hopefully) in a different way.
It is always a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusting landlords and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What does she rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to carry out a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or being hijacked by pirates.
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to tie him up?
Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends whom?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to become impoverished.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food so our food, with the structures of care so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese people.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "my enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed an ex-Rothschild banker as minister of the economy, to better defend the interests of the banksters, who alone were responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it: Turn your jacket over, put your pants down?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was swelling at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared into the dark after they had ceased firing, and a chase race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he got closer he saw that it was just a wreckage.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still moving.
After pointing his headlights at the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, finally sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee felt that the Good Hope had escaped and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have damaged them severely, so in confusion they fled to take advantage of their lead.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already done them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes were raised at the UMP to demand that it be inscribed in the law that an elected person be definitively condemned as a result of this being definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected officials, of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSE A REGISTRATION ON THE WALL OF THE MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to temper those very ones who will take advantage of their immovability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small signs "sums for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing unions, even far-right unions, targeted prominent figures on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
If, at present, the right is discharging the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that relate to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not received favorable treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that the left-wing union of magistrates is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
That a minister is so committed to supporting the unions shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you quote may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it's no secret.
One wonders now whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40> gus - You should be satisfied, SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and imprison the all-one-everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the dumbest starved of fame realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else took part in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens anyway to most stars who don’t participate in the contests.
There are few who, after one tube, manage to make others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can expect at best three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock journey, even though in your dreams you think that all the guitar frimmers who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a grade-level poem will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and kneaded by ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, as ours, of daily consideration.
Except you're recklessly interpreting it in the opposite direction.
So, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is like a reminder to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral deco to fill the void.
Nothing more than that.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw at the nettle not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a Mandarin, seldom less.
When is a comparative critique of the disciplines to make us laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is absolutely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so efficient that the interpretation of excavations is better but can still be questioned by other discoveries!
We are in the midst of (and old) controversy about shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "Les shamanes de la préhistoire", particularly the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on this.
We wouldn’t be able to watch a musical about it, however, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mickey.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, courageous, for them to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own peril.
Rather than sneer at those childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away then.
If these “childish ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots it would have left the safety because at the moment or another vehicle (trailer for example) was entering the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV rights, advertising, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I agree with that as well.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English who was then leading...
Let's go on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I have a little time to find all your c******ries.
No, I just don't.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts stewards in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of victory of one driver to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that brings out the safety because it's the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In light of the amateur footage, the lack of image above all allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner waving a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the stewards is clearly seen waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and we are more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark disregard for F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the waving green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The police station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be at 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to return to a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information you really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear” It should be “derailant,” not “cough.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are freaking out that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the antichrist.
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that nicely and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
I’m depressed that the media talks about most things with this upside down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) so the government can make us slip when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to still be of this world almost 35 years later.
Also at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffed, living with the certainty of spending it for years.....
A perfectly useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only are testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>traffic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking psychiatric patients questions when we have reliable observations from loved ones.
My psychiatric record mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's nonsense, it's an unimportant subjective testimony.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and the effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
So what do you base the research on?
About fantasies?
Are you putting whimsical theories and facts at the same level (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the phony word hailed by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has crafted us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify that famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn’t that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
Why, then?
It was a great show and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can work miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is pee-cake-like humour, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Keep your team America.
Still in supermarriage?
It will not be the same if you do not see the wires and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a channel to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it’s been at least 40 years since we’ve had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the Mosque of the Esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have failed to find anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the Mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and continuously sabotaged it!).
It is also good to show that the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: “Praise be to God!”
To boast about tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïads half-naked, languid on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what the advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
Too bad that the Reuters photographer did not photograph the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to sneak Jewish worshippers downstairs, praying at the Wall of Lamentations.
<0x40>Mat, if this photo bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that must be condemned.
This system is unsustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to stop this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be spinning, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They succeeded in convincing their employees that they are fortunate to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of moaning and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not screwed up with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It's because we're in democracy that's what's going on.
Have you voted for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Settlement Mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It’s only recently that people are starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are great benefits, when digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (well, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, to have this little relic, is comforting.
Even if it is more and more uncomfortable for her...
You still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'll join the syndicate.
If you're warned, it'll be your fault.
Protected professions endowed with trade unions are already suffering enough for the defence of categorical interests, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster is assured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject here commented...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of companies.
This is absolutely indispensable with the eruption of information power.
And yet you opened, presumably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (albeit misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a win of the worst baker; no one has ever said, "Boom, here's my fucking cake now drink it and bow down to your master!"
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and relatives out there finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can’t imagine doing that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to decide, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the slightly dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make you want to, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time given.
There is also the cancer that is waiting, with the solar wind blows.
Definitely, everything is successful for us right now.
A bad time for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “shoot” ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and allows UVA and most UVB to pass through.
Do you know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a perpetrator when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I’m a regular with melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They do not provoke it.
Proof: Not all people with tans have melanomas.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you must avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV are necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or put it in the mixer.
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if it is applied sufficient force and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the purpose for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication hardware.
But for us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if it is applied with sufficient force.
It's a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, has it already been folded?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we can hardly see how it could return to it.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................................
Most likely, this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of an FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
The article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrials" We put out super u but all the signs and even the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650 € (average salary in France)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to set their priorities where they want to.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without grudges, I kiss you
We call bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
This is total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferia, joining the left-cavia, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens can't stand this mixture of heavy-handed ideology and tartuferia so don't be surprised to often encounter critics about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the related details (airplane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left-cavia?
Well you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecologists at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but it is only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look this giraffe in the face.
She is so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Fall, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth of this work.
But you just don’t have any legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
It's art. It's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy is realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than simply representing the real.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the picture speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are still some savings: horseback riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty obliges us to say that France reduces its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
<0x40>edmond: that’s what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it’s really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where the gauntlet is certain.
Let all those who have been close to the military thing dare to come here with their eyes in the eye to say that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the public service as a whole and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really reluctant: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can consider itself a little charged!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees that they have to be done, it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at murder when it happens at home, poor dear ones.
It should be done but above all that it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Valley of Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with each closure of posts, maternity hospitals, hospitals and barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't rejoice in the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through his Facebook feed and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This Embarrassing Moment.”
I think they're gonna make it a movie.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes that his skirt has returned to his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author takes on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and squeeze his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle over who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet.”
So I don't think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
God, I have to watch this movie before I die.
I can’t believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I’ve ever read!
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling backwards!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible glow and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
God, it was really bad.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice we are confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Wind turbines and solar farms are tomorrow’s Round Points.
All financed by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it is better to limit yourself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to fight CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would be against the fight against CO2.
Christial I do not insult you I am Doctor of State in physical sciences 1981 plus I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary to what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I was saying and as all the right people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also cite the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
The emission if you do not count the uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count the water vapour greenhouse gases of less effect than the CO2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes in water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafia.
As for ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico beating 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now football, how could we ever compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The low-cost launcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is manifested only with too cold helium.
We may not be in a defective design, but in a defective implementation...
unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems well that soyouz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They might pay for the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unpleasant as many media outlets are looping up only article titles – and many readers are only retaining those titles.
All in all this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project when it is only a launcher problem.
