Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, said the European Community statistics office located in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts showed only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so that we do not have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record over the past twelve years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has picked up because of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The futures market rates of cereals have increased by 88 percent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil rose by 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent this year, but in 2009 it will drop to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, for the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup Reports Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the highest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two-thirds (71 percent) against the support of a fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent across the population.
Of the loyal voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation of the country to be particularly serious has never been higher, it rises to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook for spring and summer last year, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only one-tenth of the population expects an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of those polled, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, said the prime minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that discontent with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 percent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, currently this rate is only 20 percent. The relative majority (33 percent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intent to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would certainly vote and the additional 20 percent said they would probably vote.
For comparison, for a "legislative election to hold next Sunday", only 55 percent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent more would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be in doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees, and 84 per cent would say no to hospital fees.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital living expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained last year's average price increase of 16 percent, with the difference that this year's VAT rate has not increased.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with a value increase of well over a thousand forints showing up in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which “already flew up” in grocery stores last December, no longer rose sharply from the previous high base.
Nonetheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish have remained at almost last year's level, however prices for turkey net, nuts and poppy have risen sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, in Auchan, bread of one kilo was found at only 139 forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints per bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of daily shopping basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
When comparing last year’s most expensive basket and this year’s cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent gap while the difference between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process perplexed trade, and hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin appropriate to the intensity of the trade.)
Because of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in daily basket prices has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the prices of the least expensive basket also increased by 1,284 forints.
Moving closer to the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic foods, the Statistical Institute found a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the sudden increase in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they consistently record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-preservation food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important queues formed at the checkouts of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused mainly by the improper use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of the hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the overworking of medical personnel do not help to block the infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Not long ago, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but soon after he had to return to the hospital due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have been unable to perform a major operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multidrug-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Hospital Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief physician at the National Center for Epidemiology.
It is the number of infections caused by a multidrug-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without it developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium well resistant to antibiotics that will proliferate quickly in poor hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly patients, with low weights or with a weakened organism.
According to the managing physician of the János hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, one does not find MRSA only or one does not seek them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined for MRSA, but infection cannot always be prevented.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable for preventing the development and proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection manifests itself mainly in hospitals and seniors’ residences, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these reviews.
Most cases only emerge if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in ambulatory and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate through droplet inhalation and contact infection, however, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the contaminated patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in the event of an epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA is an exorbitant expense for social security funds, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the incidence of multidrug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, who was the perpetrator of a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official statement relating to the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since crushing a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Friday Attila Morvai, spokeswoman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he got behind the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the police station of the 22nd arrondissement crushed a 55-year-old man who found himself facing him when he turned, with his personal car, in Kossuth Lajos street of the 22nd arrondissement.
(Furthermore, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident greatly upset him.
The investigation into this case is conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
An additional €400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements worth a total of €400 million in Budapest on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund. A credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The €150 million appropriation agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss the possible modification of the initial contract once Hungary has finalised the details of the subway financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans according to the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment fees.
Bulgaria, the EU’s real estate market paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought on this EU market that is always the cheapest but will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most fashionable target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the area of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly numerous to buy in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with retail and office spaces promising the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus being a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are also looking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most of the buyers are English but others are coming from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the shores of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of second homes (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- to long-term added value.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising as a result of an ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices essentially exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Waters, the meetings of the professionals end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emission reduction period through 2012.
At the moment, there is a lively discussion on this between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss accurate figures, although it was willing to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 from the 1990 level.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need, excluding emissions reductions.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the framework of the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Waters, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its flagship role in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the successful signing of the "Post 2012 Agreement", and is ready to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also ready to make commitments tailored to their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatory to the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time made the commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the commitments of reduction below the UN body-loaded values in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of emissions, the international IPCC report of which the need has been underlined in the new IPCC report.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees celcius could no longer be avoided, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
The British military units communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan upload video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are checked at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London or uploaded by compatriots on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net by this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenseheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and it is sharing videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the original objective of the air force, the videos were passed on the net to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make known to the general public the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs almost nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, told the BBC, but it also inevitably carries a political message because it justifies in a special form the merits of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are posted on the sharing site that also feature, for example, the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical “official” propaganda films, officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been busy loading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently using the shooting game America's Army downloadable for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Labour Minister, does not seem sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by drinking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, yet another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power is entertained.
Public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence, but not the Ministry’s employees will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
In comparison with the other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, out of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be of rigour, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Justice Council (ILO) with concerts and a dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing tenders.
The building of the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre de la Ga<0xC3><0xAE>té was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person responsible.
Costume is not mandatory
The ILO building was not only home to the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of a Christmas party held a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
There were five hundred people at the ball.
The party began with the minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: Evening dress was not obligatory at all at this ball.
The ministries of health, labour and local authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, within its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her collaborators to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Authorities, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the Department of Local Authorities and Landscaping's classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall, where 436 employees are expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No party atmosphere planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the presentation of the minister but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will organize a reception on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Woods, and according to the Ministry’s communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the one hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started by a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services have communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are coming together
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form, on Friday, their strike committee that will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike of Monday.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protest will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause major traffic jams because the rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The unions of the league will make known, Friday afternoon, the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike commission of LIGA - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general assembly of protests will be held and, starting Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the Health Funds Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what action to take.
According to the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the Health Insurance Act will only take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the planned strike on Monday, major traffic stops are planned: the railways will stop work indefinitely and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half the way will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of them is constantly updated on the website of the League.
Some organizations report a strike indefinitely, others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the M<0xC3><0x81>V (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, as the Christmas holidays approached, more and more people were taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 1pm, Budapest airport between 7am and 9am, the Industrial Trade Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union called for strike for 8 hours respectively at 2 hours and 2 hours.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternation, the Union of Health and Social Sector Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new conception to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would make it possible to pass through the system the functions that merit it before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases the political risk of Hungary and the region in several aspects.
In its “risk warning”, the company points out that, in connection with the Hungarian Guard’s activity, the greatest political risk is already that “in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the already existing ethnic tension between Hungary’s gypsy and non-gypsy population.”
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is likely to provoke this situation, is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: “public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians.”
The problem gets worse, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-wing groups since the autumn of 2006, numerous associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving themselves the name of "national self-defense association".
“The common trait of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization as they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defense of order), armed if necessary, in addition, evoking the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words of the state,” they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method that, based on the resentment of the society of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil character and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultra-nationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard’s constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many disturbances of the Roma that erupted in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to set up a guard, saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense".
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own guard as resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard, showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, does not preclude Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, reads the Political Capital risk warning.
At the request of the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, director of research at Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines holidays exactly and around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will decrease next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the New Year's people can rest quietly.
In one year, we will have eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national day, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as well as October 23, which is the day to commemorate the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labor Day and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our deceased family members and friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday preceding the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions operating without interruption and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from December 24, life stops almost all over the country because according to experiences the majority of people rather work overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes to be able to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The schedule will be reorganized for the first time around Labor Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25, will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24th.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six Futile Things That Can Worry Colleagues Terribly
Emails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “beautify” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
“Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague tells you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool, or the phone and you can’t find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Are you accidentally finding your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, or they're right to be angry at you for having stolen their property.
Don’t bring envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there aren’t any more envelopes and you need them right away.
Are you talking about co-workers' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop gossip spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information in yourself and do not discuss it with your colleagues in its absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Do you claim to be sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick under the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel bad or you feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your term assignments must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something can happen that would force you to stay at home, do not forget to tell your boss and colleagues to avoid them being surprised by your absence the next day.
Smiling, Smiling, Phone
Are you diving into your work, but the laughter of your co-workers gets you out of it?
Did you unintentionally witness a phone conversation that you would have better not listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with buzzing, chanting, aloud chatting (which you lead over their heads), kicking, rude words, or loudly expressed discontent.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a mistake?
If your work is not done by the deadline, you forget to send a letter or an important message, accuse no one for this forgetfulness!
Don’t put it on account of the eventual chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you have made a mistake and if it has inconveniences for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Putting on a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on nice and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
Move gently into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'll turn the sound up.
The music changes its rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir joins it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcast the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground begin to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock ripping the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
Ferenc Török's season).
Formation in small clubs began to be known by a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their first album of 2002 as one of the fifty most important records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and her group became undeniably “trendy” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, they released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new avenues for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
It was a line of the old group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the album's premiere at the Millennium Park.
On the album, a true radio hit, Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is OK (?)
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: did your music really remain music targeting a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music for a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
A good pop song can be honest, too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young people of ten or twenty years old but also the older ones.
They follow the changes in light music much more closely because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who or how many people are listening to your music?
Zs.B.: I’m obviously happy to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or the mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn't be interesting.
hvg.hu: Will you follow Yonderboi's example?
He worked alone and made a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi’s because many of us are leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love ranks first on Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi’s chart.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to be able to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the finale of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists of the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was later called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little bit?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we wrote the album, we thought there was still something missing from that song.
The string of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she would not have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert also it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don’t have a single role, they all sing together and they don’t sing louder than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their singing.
They were behind the scenes too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little bit about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel that euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult pieces when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything got set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I’ve already “released” this record.
Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfides to risk billions because of its inferiority complex
A sneaky fraudster.
This is how its former employee refers to the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros to him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major banking houses, it recognized the U.S. mortgage market crisis in time.
“He’s fragile,” his superiors said, denouncing him to police.
However, if we stick to Kerviel’s testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man’s transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The Crisis Exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to win half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who have faced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I gained my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he had, of course, kept nothing to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to misrepresenting the reports in order not to be screened.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to be interested in his transactions.
Who does not risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid of being discovered?
Pretty much not.
"I estimated that the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so much come from?
He only came to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less respected than the others.
In view of my university and my professional and personal background," Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after he took office, he achieved his first major success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he gained half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in Londres.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“It was like a snowball effect,” he told police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they suspected.
“As long as I was winning, they were pretending to close their eyes.”
This is where the start of the year comes in.
He loses a billion dollars in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that it has lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“Last year, I took only four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to another,” concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech kronor) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to secure financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Businesses should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal upheld the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence for the country's former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
Later, however, he was released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictitious corporations and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the hectic debate leading up to the vote on the declaration of distrust to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has passed this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and each article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Politicians’ disputes are of much greater interest to opinion than to abrupt numbers.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments were suffering from three ills that the current budget is not able to settle at once:
The first is the large share of mandate fees imposed by law, made up not only of pensions but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M parties.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle, on the other hand, is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued stunned bonds, excessively indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, taxes and bank loans.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of the shares of the distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
Based solely on official and verifiable facts, it can be seen that:
Our economy has been going through a phase of growth for several years now, just like the rest of the world, and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not fail to vent itself.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous disgrace that falls essentially on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have become unnecessarily swollen in recent years.
Although we have succeeded in removing some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, if a delay in the retirement age limit, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever will be in power, it will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes ordinary expenses to be pushed back by mandate fees.
The $70 billion deficit projected for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to collect in taxes and taxes, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be for the banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, it will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the Central Banks of Individual States have decided to take such concerted action, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," writes Bernard Baumohl in his report to clients of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group.
“The concerted action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts still expect further losses in billions.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really grasp what can still follow," said ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The Central Banks made this choice after they failed to lower the interbank rate of Londres, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks repeatedly lowered their interest rates during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by the central banks will not help to ward off the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem that is the collapse of the U.S. housing market.
President Klaus: the debates of the environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism came down this time at the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a word-rocket, a substitute for solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested parties can read their positions without distorting them.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
Indeed, he is an academic capable of following and appreciating scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following theses: the climate is constantly changing, the changes of it are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too large nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the change of the climate are inacceptably unnecessary.
All the more so since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose untrue opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago, at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to renew their driver’s license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
This is the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so the authorities will be able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will be on the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving license especially those who no longer want to drive.
As municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are inundated with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The City Council satisfies about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a queue of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for delivery within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an extra five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to renew their driver's licence by the end of the year and who will be on the road without a valid licence will face a fine from January onwards.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence through amicable proceedings.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2,500 kroner.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was liable to a fine.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1,000 kroner.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one faces fines in the tens of thousands.
The driver's license, he said, is a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not as with the ID card, which must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, these are about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the sentences of detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych’s gang, will serve thirteen and ten years in prison, respectively.
The Prague High Court thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 year and 2 years, respectively.
Initially, detectives from the Department for the Fight against Organized Crime faced 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment handed down today, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is only waiting for the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already received sentences of more than 16 years in other trials.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court convicted 19 people for participating in the heists, and the Superior Court was now dealing with the appeals of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the accused have questioned the prosecution by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, members of the police, after an agreement with Berdych among others, transmitted to the criminals information from police sources, covered the various heists and helped the members of the gang avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang returned 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment speaks of the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies, the victims of which have, in most cases, suffered a serious harm to health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a sight for direct laser shooting or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Aside from nearly 20 men from the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a whole host of others guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has for the time being avoided Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>ta and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are currently being held in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the families affected, wants to obtain compensation from the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital in the amount of 12 million kronor plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very, very high," Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party commissioned the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 K<0xC4><0x8D> for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov’s family was asking for one million crowns for each month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were prone to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were faced with remorse for not having been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the trauma experienced in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermák in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il region handed over 100,000 kronor to each of the families for reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to take out liability insurance.
In the event of a breach, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Until now, the courts had recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Královstv<0xC3><0xAD> (the Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko)
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute concerning the trade mark Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské královstv<0xC3><0xAD> (Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko Kingdom).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who first used the title King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko, but the project was set up by the team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, a former collaborator of the actor.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team parasitize on the popularity of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> is of the same opinion.
"There's a job of almost ten years behind us.
To search for money and to focus on events,” he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
“After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka who first used the title vala<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> král (King of Vala<0xC5><0xA1>sko) in his television program.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD> crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had nothing to do with the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of releasing Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské Královstv<0xC3><0xAD> passports.
From a humorous action originally emerged a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, of the company Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské královstv<0xC3><0xAD>.
In 1997 Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka accepted that his name and signature be mentioned in the passport and he even offered to the holders balances on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the naked idea, published by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in the show mané<0xC5><0xBE>, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka certainly helped the Vala<0xC5><0xA1>ské kralovstv<0xC3><0xAD> project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves to the project in an intense way.
Collaboration between the now enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
But from there, conflicts began to build up between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, which culminated in the deposition of "King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, assumed by singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a complaint against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, claiming that the court has now rejected.
What could clear the matter is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half of the princess.
There should be a new king out of it.
He did not yet want to betray the details and the date.
“We don’t want to go fast on the job.
it would be something like the parade of the kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can of course register," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gear change, the driving and also that of the manufacture could, in many ways, be described as inferior to the average.
Currently, there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, which is significantly better.
Especially since the combi named SW goes a step further, I only have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained, for example, about headroom on the rear seats.
While there are finished the complaints because the combi body means that even the great devils will, in this regard, be comfortable.
Let's see quickly done
I will talk about the inside very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark about the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when you could complain about too short seats or backrests is over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is noticeable there too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle, therefore, is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate this as very accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy securing.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not cumbersome and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, the latter makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Apart from the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we can see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the crate that remains after the backrests of the rear seats are overturned perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback walk.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by <0xC5><0xA0>koda that often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar clogged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine amounting to 329 900 K<0xC4><0x8D> is still affordable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
Now, we have available in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle ultimately costs 531 900 K<0xC4><0x8D>.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you'll get a very similar figure.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is going badly
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among the remnants about the evolution of local education.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the native inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of North Kent, where conflicts between remaining Slovak immigrants and immigrants are beginning to escalate, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, clashes and fights between students have been transposed into relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted her with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant led by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly addressed racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
“When we got home, a young man climbed up the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks,” another unpleasant adventure was described by a mother of Slovak pupils.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to call the conflicts with immigrants a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in British schools between native residents and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
Seventy thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can come true if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
All-inclusive fins with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the stronghold of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 20's.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coj<0xC3><0xAD>mar he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians across America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you can mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigouli and the old imported fiat have already been rotten for a long time, in a climate so salty and humid.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably declining, nowhere else in the vicinity are there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n, and also on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be appreciated especially by fans of small trains.
The cane had come back from the extended plantations in the sweets on a narrow lane by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives can be seen in operation whose contemporaries are only in museums elsewhere.
Where to direct your footsteps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
There is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of Vi<0xC5><0x88>ales to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
Exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogotes, limestone balloons and rocks rise candlelit from the bottom of the valley, and, having caught fertile earth in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where Cuban tobacco of the best quality is grown.
The final shape of this product can be found if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone might also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was shot.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
An ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth was embodied in the beauty and showcase city character of this small town.
Koloniáln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA1>pan<0xC4><0x9B>lská architektura,v<0xC3><0xBD>razn<0xC4><0x9B> ovlivn<0xC4><0x9B>ná pozd<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>mi francouzsk<0xC3><0xBD>mi osadn<0xC3><0xAD>ky, se za <0xC4><0x8D>ty<0xC5><0x99>i stalet<0xC3><0xAD> tém<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> nezm<0xC4><0x9B>nila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is so far apart that even in the 50's of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the sidelines.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone was content to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes alive after sunset and where the music only gets quiet in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town located in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads there.
The two roads that lead from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has inscribed the eastern coffin of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of World Heritage Sites.
We make the best chocolate, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where stands the old castle and the current hotel El Castillo, we see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Sows and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this one could fill a number of pages.
But, as they say, it is better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
According to the United States, the lack of troops and necessary equipment has an impact on the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the growing challenge on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the U.S. this week called on NATO troops through Defense Minister Robert Gates for greater activity, Britain sees strengthening Afghan government authority and intensifying development aid as a priority.
“Evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased 27 percent from last year, up to 60 percent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
Now, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts between the countries involved over whether all allies are actually doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
“The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan lazy people discovered: Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counter-attack by posting a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government Debt Will Rise to $1 Billion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 kronor falls on each Czech.
At the end of September, total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of better-than-expected savings in the state budget, the Ministry reduced the projected amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to 842.7 billion kronor.
During the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns falls on each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it appears that, thanks to a smaller deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border by a trillion kroner only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the server iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I’m not expecting that change,” he said.
Debts are growing
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is generated mainly by the accumulation of the deficits of the state budget.
Government debt is financed by treasury bonds, annuity bonds, direct borrowings or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has so far increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has increased this year from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and as of June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt payability of the state was 6.5 years.
“Total debt increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 percent, which, given the current good health of the economy, is far too high.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be matter to be negotiated when pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than we expected
It follows from the government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, which the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of September, thanks to a better-than-expected evolution of savings in the state budget, the ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The sum is essentially made up of the deficit in the state budget, which will clearly reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the originally planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely 13.3 billion kronor, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state annuity securities for 43 billion kronor and the repayments of European Investment Bank loans amounting to 1.8 billion kronor.
She appeared before a court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils aged 6-7 give the name Muhammad to a teddy bear while any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with a lash.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with breaching Islam and sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her pupils, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not carry any labels with that name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," according to him, it is only an "innocent mistake."
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very caring towards her students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given first name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians concluded a sixth and final session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was “at stake,” his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to abide by their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
“There are no immediate plans for violence, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council from granting independence in Kosovo, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
The unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," said the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden where the "last chance negotiations" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade’s autonomy plan “belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.”
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade, in particular, said it feared a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be returned exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made “in consultation” with Westerners.
Bush torn off Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he met on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the “roadmap” for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim “to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues.”
The name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the plight of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and address all aspects of a settlement, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others.”
In turn, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and that he would make "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his "two-state vision" of Palestinians and Israelis that coexist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment in this direction from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offers peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
"Annapolis marks a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Saudi Arabia's Prince Saud said in an interview.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of fact various, official versions and rumors oppose.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
“She was not in intervention but on patrol, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without a lighthouse,” a police source said.
A green Kawazaki-branded motorcycle, “unapproved, therefore not allowed to ride on the public road” (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating “very fast”.
“She hit the police car on her left, after a priority denial on the right,” a police officer said.
The blood alcohol test on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before depressed, starry windshield, bumper ripped off) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, co-ordinating with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the rubbing of the footbells on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had very quickly left the premises, thus not providing assistance to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which one has to be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness for the few moments after the accident.
One of his windows facing the scene.
“We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them,” said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely hagar policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the youths, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived “about twenty minutes after the departure of the police.”
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
“I will not let it be said that the police services did not assist the young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first protests since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
They responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court bar lawyers called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Further demonstrations were reported to have taken place in Multan (central) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement on Monday garnered support from religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to judges who pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and detritus to those who swore an oath before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exceptional measure proclaimed Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to decide on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election to the presidential election, on October 6, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the military head and become a civilian president “doesn’t hold up” after the establishment of a state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile pill still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless led to a better "control of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated by month for one in five couples and if possible in spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "crafted" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical room tasked with hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see box).
This module is a kind of landing dock for modules-laboratories.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power module already present on the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it was there that one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged for about a meter by a cable that got stuck.
Deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel with a faulty rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go snail at the end of the 30-metre-long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, tough, very skilful, it has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor was therefore tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed sorts of "spins" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on the solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "crafted" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his tools and returning to the station's interior.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
EADS shares are currently down sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defense group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast following delays caused by the slow progression in the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further clarification.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating profit fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delays of another program, that of the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
Choosing the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the ballot box: the Russians will opt massively for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the head of the list of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is predicted to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let any of this appear by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - its favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without a hitch,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
It denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziuganov says that “there have never been such a dirty election, even in the days of Yeltsin.”
After the crackdown on last weekend’s protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protests, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus”
Behind these unsustainable legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
No successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel that they are masters of their destiny,” said Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society in this Christianized country fell behind five centuries after Europe; the so-called community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “willingly renounce personal responsibility” which they had shown briefly after the break-up of the USSR.
“What’s the point of thinking?”
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old teacher: “What good is it to think about?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were until now only consultable for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say individually and by name, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to carry out research “in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, had opposed the opening to the public of such naming documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Such as the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported civilians or subject to compulsory labour and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches almost 60 billion euros per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU foreign ministers gave the European Commission the green light to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU’s ninth trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact would greatly work for both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European commissioner. The Asian and European giants exchange each year for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of European services", said on Friday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of India Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, regretting that the bilateral trade of the Manhan Newman did not reach.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusually long-term offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve input during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of a five-week open market transaction," the bank said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time it appears that BoE has been putting five-week liquidity on the market in an open market operation.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE said in a statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain rates" of day-to-day interbank loans in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, an increase since September 18.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound's price against the euro, many preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the increase of 50% of the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the framing of rents.
With UMP and NC voting against the review of the articles (180 to 115), the meeting was adjourned after the general discussion which resulted in an exchange, sometimes vivid, between a majority and opposition to a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with someone who has, no more or less, inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produced the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now accommodates up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as the marketplace and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” Jones said.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration,” Jones said.
“Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, having made its mark in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
These two festivals are held in urban areas.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours takes place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban to the American.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are interesting enough to allow us to invest in such an event and host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s capacity is “very large,” like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of going in the press.
“Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all sorts of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
Its partners at C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the paws of the “Governator”?
“We need to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
The race at festivals
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema from here.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
All the festivals on the West Side, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in hopes of the arrival of the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange generally has positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are looming in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not in favour of the stock market gaining momentum during the final weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight to quality values both in the short and in the long periods".
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the Fed's likely drop in rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the best thing,” the expert said.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has fallen nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year as he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day bridge (on December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused by the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case they start.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert said.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that tech companies will do it as well very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, December has only been a bearish month on two occasions.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the drilling of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it succeeds in computer on its end-of-year rally.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 noon Monday to Saturday
Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10 am to 8:30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the Banque Populaire's experiment will be decisive for whether or not other organizations will adhere to this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in the SMEs and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of those already existing.
To do this, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank's chief commercial officer, said the renovation would not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees would increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of Madrid’s Murillo Brave, O’Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a streets are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very ample schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.

With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco executive advisor, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not that we have increased more but that we have decreased less,' he said.
However, he stressed that in a weak market, ‘we have fallen less’.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain has stabilized its loss at 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reached 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which fell 1.52 percent yesterday and has accumulated a decline of 40.5 percent since January, costs half, $2,193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded communication companies was 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that "we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the executive advisor of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
For this announced data to be real, the television channel is expected to record a 3.6 per cent increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million for the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenna 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for Telecinco's best relative evolution on the stock market is the significant payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company headed by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the 33% purchase of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to those to whom we have already given shares with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company lowered Antenna 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the rules of procedure that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the organizations so that the markets function effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, at a time when it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FSAs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which competes with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management, and it requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economic Commission, several amendments have been added, including one that highlights that securitized debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage of to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The Harmonized Consumer Price Index increased by five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data which will be revealed on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In all cases Solbes clarified in the corridors of the Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover €42,000 million over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (€16,800 million) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time he was amassing some record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that is gradually falling in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of this money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the UK banks’ revenues that will be deposited in the next three years to get that remaining 18,000 million pounds until the target of 30,000 million pounds is reached.
The tycoon group Richard Branson, known for its sassy advertising campaign in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the offer of the Virgin association, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcia commune of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced the me of May last Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the "leader" of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Planning Council and the possibility of new stops is not ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption, discovered earlier this week, has been imputed.
As the SER channel told the lawyer of the member of the 'people's party' Juan Morales yesterday, he was arrested when he left Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the plot.
In addition, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to head the Spanish Socialist Party list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
So the secretary of organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of that party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician from La Mancha will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside over Congress if the socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of Congress, who on November 15th made public his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his political career to dedicate himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or screaming" and make it "more and more like the citizens".
“Sometimes it seems regrettably that the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk quietly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend that he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, in what his opponents could consider "a domination".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate change movement is subjecting both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles to merciless persecution, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has contributed decisively to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he must clearly explain to the Spaniards what steps he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be forced on us, what economic consequences will this have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was and will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is a matter of sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Up to one-hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero electorally so dangerous that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for electoral campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and that does not claim that we move by bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and Totana Local Police Chief Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of the Murcian locality of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, informed today the sources of the investigation.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at the moment many officers met, who also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of urban planning and the municipal enterprise of management of industrial soil and housing.
These three stops are in addition to the six stops made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which is being investigated by the No. 1 Totana Tribunal.
The first six detainees have now passed to a court order.
According to the sources, the previous city councilor of Totana and currently an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former city councillor, who lives in Murcia.
The director and the owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur from Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Nuaria Group agency, through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a poultry product company well known in the area, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that have been requalified and its project would imply doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with the real estate development; Conycase, which manages the car parks of Vigo in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The contents of the Philosophy course appealed to public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato about what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.”

A colleague passes the information on the introduction in the Criminal Code of crimes on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime punishable by a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros, is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the traffic of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film under section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without author ' s permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).

My attending physician told me about one of his articles on strange research titled, ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depends on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group in charge of neurocognition imaging at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurs when the participant responds correctly and his partner fails."
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received twice as much, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbobosnio leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list, whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's List' (2006, not exclusively screened in Spain), with the rhythm of a crime thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues the fleeing criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
Which insurance is suitable for me?
Automobile insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible claims, involves a significant expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's license, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use made of it, among others.
Insurance companies determine their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the likelihood of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
As the frequency increases, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will explain the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various inconveniences when contracting with affordable insurance, such as low driving experience and seniority.
While the ideal for being well insured is risk-free insurance, other, more economical options exist.
The most forward-thinking drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with deductible, so that they get insurance coverage at all risks but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the claim amount that the customer pays will be based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," said Luis Noguera, the head of First Europa's Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be cautious and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which can reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic rate.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it can afford to increase the bonuses, "clarifies Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is better to choose an all risk insurance with frankness.
“Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience gained beforehand after an accident,” says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not have children yet, it is preferable that he negotiate insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be a risk insurance with franchise (can be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more casual driving and they have more purchasing power to afford the luxury of assuming a larger amount of franchises," Noguera said.
For retirees a risk-free insurance with deductible is preferable (with this being 150 euros), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible claims, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to study appropriately the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will seek to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are competing next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the missing point to reach their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not pass him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan is due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a seat for the 16th December final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning it would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth finals.
A defeat of the team of Gordon Strachan could be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but they will not be able to computer only on that since with nine points the game goes to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milans will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of ranking for the eighth final for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal by Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the rossoneri, the triumph would only come to Shakhtar, in case Celtic loses, to qualify for the eighth finals to be able to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is the last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend Vancouver's first Spice Girls tour concert
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of around 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band's reunion was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people sold out the tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video that tells the story of the band that was furious in the late 1990s.
The encounter and world tour coincide with the release of a new album that reprises their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the crowd that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', which left the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
She has five and seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will be exhibited on December 23.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine raises the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia is fermenting, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conveyed through pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two had caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia’s gas-supplying monopoly company, tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as expected, given that it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would mean for Ukraine a 40% increase in import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas passes," Ukraine's economy minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
Fluctuations in gas costs are likely to be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine.
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of supplies of Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, which increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest stockpiles of gas, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health “must monitor its foreign employees.”
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve checks on its extra-community employees to see if they have criminal precedents, the control committee said.
The Revisor General's warning, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health does not have any precise data on the number of people employed overseas.
The report nonetheless highlighted other decisive checks, correctly performed on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General did checks on extra-community personnel following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing his jeep into the gates of the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October on suspicion of being involved in various car blast attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the Auditor General now states that the committees are required to confront the Bureau of Criminal Precedents, thus allowing employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"While we have found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time," the report said.
Mr. Black said the Scottish Ministry of Health does most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Peter Terry, chairman of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
“The report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can provide any added value.”
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of staff with indefinite contracts, who might or might not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for controls by health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian, are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passport, work permit and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its policy and system of pre-employment checks for staff outside the health service.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report due next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on Joy Division’s latest singer, Ian Curts, has won five awards, including best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was engaged in the role of Curtis in this film whose director is Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Judi Dench has been named Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be in the international spotlight.
The awards were distributed during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film, which was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just 3 million sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, has won two awards, the first as best director and the second as best beginner director.
Rock has also won Best Documentary for Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, known for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was in awe of this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The independent film Oscars, better known as “Les Bifas” are awarded by a jury of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa's fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Blocks 208 Terrifying Plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells handling an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergy and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launching expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appeared to have plotted the assassination of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim government allied with the United States, considered heretical according to the Saudi Sunny hardline.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have worked with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls made against the pro-Western Saudi government by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thought,” the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, has led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency’s probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth’s potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
University of Oxford physics professor Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “We are beginning to understand why Venus’ climate is so different from Earth’s, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task as a presidential candidate to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters having registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as that from another debate on YouTube, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have largely reflected the conditions of the Republican party, which is running for election.
It is unclear on what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest on a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the strongest issues for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who leads the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (providing illegals with regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have succeeded in deepening this issue.
Neither of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with concerns particularly about the toxic toys made in China, or other fears about the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize, divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the entirety of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, in a recent election in Iowa, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism, declare that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When they insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Huckabee’s resurgence in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious search for grants led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday’s debate.
These two have emerged from nothingness, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés cannot agree to decide who is the best known and most traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a message of success on American greatness bringing the leaders together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a wealthy businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: a new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the prime minister backtracked on his proposed election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls had not influenced his decision, but that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble at the edge of crack, has demonstrated a breach of directives and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against military spending cuts: they proclaimed that being a defense minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former chief of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even rule for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press seeks bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, Mr. Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to dismiss Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr Brown's decisions made when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he’s not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long investigation into the party’s “cash for members of the House of Lords” funds, voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown faces is not so tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as members of the Tory party make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, might be to realize the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown of always, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very peculiar figure who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of politicians’ big backers are clear, and they exist for good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the grant collections who spoke of the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: There is no indication that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making power rests on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financials of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could cause it to renounce its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good election advantage; it has two years to win back voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see fins swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of weak cardholders.
It is still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89 percent is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in laws in 2005 in the United States regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in credit card capital security is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of issuance for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infectious links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that equitable property borrowings have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of wealth, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to repay everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery in stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial catastrophe in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market drive America into recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Pay close attention to the dorsal fins.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify their roles in a fraud committed by Enron’s previous chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first pleaded not guilty to the seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves against their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all pleaded guilty to committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC group, became famous across Britain because of the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges inflicted on them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was being investigated by the government in the Enron debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, dubbed the “Natwest Three,” claim to have come to Houston in 2000 to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to trick bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as zero, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest from the subsidiary bank for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest on this company.
According to the accuser, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three Britons were released following the payment of a bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting scams, could no longer hide his billions of debt or even offer his fake speculations as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of layoffs, more than $60 billion loss of market value and more than $2 billion loss for retirement plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not under, not out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and possessing sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“Even if no one really needs as many seats as this is more of a family aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Salon, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition center around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars such as 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, on display next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so wealthy and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world’s biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth globally $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking through the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Miss Yumatova, who was grabbing her high fashion dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the corks to come up to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum blades, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and teddy bears Gund are exhibited.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands,” said Mr. Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand Delf, in front of a handmade Raimbrant wall painting on blue tiles.
“Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, the sellers said here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already switched from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, roam the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he had sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold thread.
On the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive on such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage that already contains 30 or 40 vehicles.”
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
“There’s more to it than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company erected four stalls representing the British telephone booths, filled with masses of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s chief marketing officer, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of bills, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the middle of this false wealth or pocketing a few million.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unapproved Surgeon Suspected of Homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the windows of the Just a little Healthier restaurant and watched an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
and then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Livingston, a restaurant official, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the Newark Police Department director.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confident that the results of toxicological tests will, unfortunately, take time, but should solve this mysterious death that has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been the assistant to Police Director Garry F. Mc Carthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious,” McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Board, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgery.
“This is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared deceased.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if a part of the house was being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Miss Castro's where a faded rose tree lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and there again when I left.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce rates linked to the buzz of the global stock market.
Stocks exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm down credit conditions, later reducing interest rates promoted by the U.S. central bank’s vice president’s soothing statements.
Stock markets are booming in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, said those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulence has partly “reversed some improvements in market functioning in late September and October.
Should this severe turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for homeowners and businesses, he said.
The comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into U.S. markets, and that further interest rate declines could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The repercussions of this financial tumult were accentuated following the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will leave 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to offset the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 jobs are planned in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, 2.55% concluding at 13,289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, concluding at 6,306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of UK companies.
The German Dax index rose 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for an auction of monthly tri-funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the heavy 4.7% rate, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London financial markets, causing credit tensions, has caused the monthly “Libor” borrowing rates of British banks to cause their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a sharp rise since November 12.
England faces an appeal to judgment against critics Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the coaching chairman who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Chief Executive Officer of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Whoever fails to win the number 6 badge will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is too.
It is never easy to annihilate what allows one man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is the right time to bring Bopara to the surface?
Is it just in relation to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, who to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new managers with good degrees, professional, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time he must take the door and a batter must be lucky to hit the cricketer one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class gates on 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett has only taken 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer it again.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who will play in Asgiriya Stadium, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five gates and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primordial cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double-hundred mark against Australia in Australia can still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greater experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut at the 88 Test in Mumbai, 32 first-class cents against six for Bopara, who is seven years younger at the age of 22, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah only made ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his so obvious momentum in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joie de vivre.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently flipped over a 4x4 at a presentation from Volkswagen, England’s sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from afar, to ask him if “he’d seen that?”
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his speed allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection?
I would be conducive to giving Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he will be playing this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and to fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the militants who have driven them away from home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-assisted militia allowed Al Qaeda to be driven from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have attracted the capital’s growing slump since U.S. troops arrived, and the sight of continuing training of well-armed “groups of citizens involved” collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, the father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by all about visas for exiles than Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia Prime Minister, who allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We didn’t have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them back into Iraq,” Sunni said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The drop in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-deprecation, posters for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Economic Institute in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with neighboring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saarland also leads the country's children to higher schools in more than average numbers - many of them without a diploma from the Gymnasium.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people earn their degree in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also, the possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
In terms of the number of inhabitants, the double-curricular panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and growing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has forced graduate schools to a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federated state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of day care is duty-free - a model that other federal states are copying in the meantime as well.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether student performance is improving sustainably.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the percentage of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Saxons, foreign language knowledge is not measured by the PISA studies - otherwise one could gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if Sardinians are not French.
Chavez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, watches will soon tickle differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will raise the stopwatch by half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez has become a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set to less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones into full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighboring country, Colombia, because of a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who hastens a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's negotiating mandate for the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly "spuked in the face" of Venezuela with the decision, Chávez had criticized Sunday.
In Spain, too, Chávez is in everyone’s mouths.
A new mobile phone ringtone is making the country a rave: "Why don't you shut up" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to remain silent.
Lower wages threaten Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic conditions, a real low salary threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all sorts of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault is the low wage development, the increase in the value added tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research told Bild newspaper.
New charges could also arise in terms of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices rose 3.0 percent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought: the European spacecraft Venus Express has discovered lightning bolts in the atmosphere and swirls of wind at the poles, similar to those that appear in the winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning bolts on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has today provided proof of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus bursts at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud-to-cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprine, lightning would have caused life to appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very early date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There are hardly any living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, there are sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
Why Venus, which resembles Earth so much in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venusian research, since no probes had been on their way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind swirls already known at the north pole, a swirl of clouds at the south pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called the evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler calls for an end to the party quarrel over the Dalai Lama's admission to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD over the attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and summons the grand coalition to end the quarrel over the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue,” Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that she would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
“China knows that too,” said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's reception and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the "frontier policy" of the CDU in terms of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government has not only decommissioned German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to reports from the Spiegel, also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s reception was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama’s words and deeds would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also encompasses other provinces today.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fighting with police, shooting, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets by violence, demanded the German Interior Minister.
Barricades burning, breakers shooting at police with hunting rifles: After the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not also build up in our home and defuse into violence.
We must take this seriously,” he told the Neue Presse in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to the alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian towns, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were demanded by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stresses that the rate of unemployment among young people under the age of 25 with an immigration background would be above average.
Above all, more places should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: “We must give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted: "But we must still be cautious."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to participate in work and training quickly."
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities reported three arrests as well as a few cars and trash cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to early evidence from the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The chancellor’s utopian entry on stage shows that the coalition is done with the bottom – and that there is nothing to expect from her anymore.
In what country does this chancellor live?
After his deplorable intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics has been pushed back by Angela Merkel from a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said, and only showed by that she doesn't want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made visible to everyone how correct this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, who flees into foreign policy and even there remains in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam Agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of oneself - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it even two years ago.
Now it clings to ready-made formulas, that growth would touch people.
In doing so, she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty among children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional sentences left for this.
In this regard, the number of times it lapses when it comes to family allowances is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
It stutters in unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the YouTube debate of Republican presidential candidates, two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney engage in a tough offensive battle — and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension among the candidates is already erupting on the first issue.
It would have made New York a “refuge for illegals,” Mitt Romney reproaches his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say his own home was a haven for illegal immigrants," Giuliani said, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates go on the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use debates on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that internet users sent via YouTube are barely more than blowers.
“It’s with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power,” John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being vigorously taught by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are being praised or future tax increases are being refused, applause is raging in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney contrits, apologizing to the base and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, slips into a slippery knot when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian life.
A day after his withdrawal as chief of armies, Pakistani man of power Musharraf was invested as president.
Thus eight years of domination by the army ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after his seizure of power by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as chief of civil status.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on November 3.
Already shortly after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, last week dismissed all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are returning.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s are playing again: the three members of the group Harmonia once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that Harmonia is playing again has assured some excitement among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, of course, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the Germans also have the right to celebrate their living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krautrock" has always rained more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, we saw in the room the German pop faces interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers stage as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance within oneself and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
We played first in the cellars below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly troubled Kraftwerk and finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the manner of Spitzweg.
In the trash was supposedly a fan of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retained Harmonia far from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
As serene and modest as the music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood alone did not serve for self-seeking.
The CD "Live 1974" that has just been released was recorded during a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone believes to remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Her label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the paperback book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole range of fluctuation of the influence of Krautrock would be defined with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s phrase hovers in the room amidst singular sounds: “The only true music, you listen to the future.”
There are photos that show the producers with Harmonia in the room of the farm.
Projections of other black and white photos of tools wired in bazaar serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and drums, to shoot the instruments with unheard of sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built by yourself.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in great technical fignoleurs.
Even the house choir will not change this.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots have been sought less in the blues than in the music conservatories (Can), in the technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia, too, is no longer irritated by it now.
But what is most self-evident will be meticulously covered on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone’s nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Murderer", two films deal again with the Balkan War.
But both are not convincing.
Either the projects rely too much on action and the exchange of senseless shots or on the contrary they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the most dismal hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many nice and futile roles in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him in the desire to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films must be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of winks: deep down, his character of war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Mortal Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequence of failed films about the Balkan War.
"Mortal Peace" can quickly be tried: the film tells of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are once and for all not presented as the only causes of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm gets lost far too quickly in the action and the exchange of senseless shots.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at bottom there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track down the top war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both at once Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go as a small team into the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as he was presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute her to a romantic adventure with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages to achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have not succeeded in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for a just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
This is so bad that the International Court of Justice in The Hague should be charged with crime against cinematic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still on the loose, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) of not conducting the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionately, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiresome it is to be evil."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but that hint at how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films about South Africa.
Which is worth every time: when a star hangs out on a crisis focal point or on a minefield, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits gehen Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with "Schindler's List."
Some films have yet to mature - those that today are worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have by no means been unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatomb arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights the writers the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" actually became as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change."
“Great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust received criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The mayor's resignation from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics clashed in politics and the economy with fierce criticism.
Many want to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appraisal of chances.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
“Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures.”
Schmidt-Trenz calls on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as a starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday said Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, regarding the candidacy of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028 so far, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust’s statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, by burying the projects already now," HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the plenary reception of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Sports Higher Schools had first named Hamburg as a candidate city in recent weeks.
The mayor’s SPD group has accused the Senate of not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and ruled out the construction of housing,” said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for the Little Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have bet exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg would have aroused great enthusiasm.
Hamburg broke up against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
At the moment, wooden crates made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Much of the ninety "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm today culminates in a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum gifted in 1995 the "Moderna-Boxes" on the international market, as well as the "Moderna-Museum"
The ancient history is entangled, a bewildering sequence of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the powdered soap boxes "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cartoning factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time speak today of about fifteen wooden crates that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as authorized original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol, with the appellation "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum erroneously claimed later that about a hundred wooden crates had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol later sold to him.
In fact, the 105 Hulten boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, three other private Swedish collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was applied directly without a backing layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roller - moreover, it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come up with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify its six crates in the collection."
Already in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of boxes of powdered soap.
But since then there is an inexorable silence there.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers are abandoning, the same ones who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The faithful soldiers in power had stormed the hotel shortly before using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
About half of them stood in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 supporters.
The military police officers, who were normally to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal troops in power surrounded the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chair convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People have had enough,” Trillanes said.
“We’re calling on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who was in command before the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units would soon join the march.
Critics of the regime called for a major demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
Manila’s financial district has been the scene of an attempted mutiny by about 200 military personnel against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts to putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 percent in telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as communicated by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buyback.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This step aims to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is said in the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a stake of almost 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has listed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the commercialization of DSL and mobile telephony products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a spokesperson for United Internet.
The two companies founded the MSP holding company in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For now, the two companies want to be satisfied with their 10 percent stake in Freenet, and not make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent at Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
The two companies, however, would leave all options open, particularly increasing participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet over a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL and full subscription customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had until now a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring about an additional four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
