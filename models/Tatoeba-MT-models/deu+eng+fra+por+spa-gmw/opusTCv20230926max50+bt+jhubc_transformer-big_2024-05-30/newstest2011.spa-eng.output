What is counted? The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD councillors in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the Prague Board and City Council components to understand their renewed SDG partners.
The Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when Prague was governed by the current members of the coalition.
The coded dictionary that used the political flower and cream of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is, I don't know."
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics," said Councillor of Culture Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> during the "college" terminology exam.
And when it comes to the political veteran, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same way.
You may know the concept of "golf hole".
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all the things you asked me to wear from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "Bull's Nude", "Capital Betrayal" and "Blindar".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Prague in the future, initially agreed, but did not take the phone again.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, directly refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I don’t want to value how civic Democrats have fun.”
“What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As it has been seen, Councilman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> supposedly did not realize that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The word "Voldemort" says nothing to Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>; the only term he got on the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But rather I know it from the news."
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the Councillor for Environment Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both sociodemocrats know who Voldemort really is and Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; furthermore, he suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery".
"I think it means going to a Prague company"; Plach<0xC3><0xBD> soon discovers that it is the headquarters of the Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek companies.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, there is no more familiar glossary of colloquial terms among sociodemocrats.
“I asked my teammates, but it really looks like we don’t have anything like that.”
“Rather, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations, or play puns with names,” says Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD president Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose partymates call Hulda.
“In school they called me B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za, but I don’t know if my classmates call me that too,” confesses his own nickname Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his partymates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the cheating elections during the party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobile") from some of his teammates.
Nicknames are also the only expressions sociodemocrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of the clubs" apparently remembers that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in law from the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", as published in a brochure
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually older, cannot work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such but."
“Nor are healthy young women isolated, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, is occupied in a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual “social measure.”
He issued an informative brochure that should help prevent witch hunting.
However, this has a hit.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” warns Die Standard newspaper of the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso’s neighbor, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was caught in the oil that is used for ritual anointings.
It was set on fire when the group wanted to "expel evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: “The devourers of human souls have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government tries to appease the witch hunt, in the Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt’s death, launched an extensive hunt for witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic.”
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, about 1,000 people were finally released.
Bakala tenant: warms up with coal stoves and signs higher rent
The elderly and reluctant man walked through the doors of the RPG Byty customer service center of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter’s and his son’s, who is serving sentence.
All three have just caught the rent liberalization.
Instead of 3,500 CZK per month, the child will pay 4,100 CZK from next year onwards for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in the new contract of his son, over whose signature he has full powers.
“But I signed it,” he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But before this, man only makes a move.
“Every one says one thing,” he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
That is why Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, by Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number pickup machine.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a light button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
There is almost no time to read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as formerly: requests for settlements, insurance issues, and the like.
Letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the tenants’ mailboxes of most of the 44,000 RPG-owned flats around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to them in the cards an increase of the rent between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window in the customer service center for new rentals opens.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," the workers who are in it respond after a brief hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the former apartments for miners in Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of the Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaorálek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, has already dealt with them loud and clear, and they now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
“I wasn’t even changed the damn bathroom dish,” the man mentioned in the introduction vents out.
According to the workers, at the moment they are mostly retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the discount on the February rental.
However, the window of mining “liberalization” certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for the rental in 2011,” she said.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and on its planks to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rent, the matter must be resolved by an independent judge.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and fully lawful way to proceed," RPG said in a statement.
“No one is going to be judged here,” says one of Byty’s RPG employees and a man standing on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I don’t have the means to go to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait,” he says.
The rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that annoys the tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that highlights in red.
“The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties.”
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," it says on the screen.
Only increased by 38% the 400-story rental of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” RPG says.
On 2,600 flats, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect rents at once, but will escalate between four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see the graph) back into the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people signing the rent increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
Nobody would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all its own to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, from whose studio numerous well-known buildings in Brno emerged, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-garden.
Around 90 people work in the company, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its workers as part of its social program.
The builders and architects thus have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with the care of their children.
The mini-garden was an idea of the employees of Arch.Designu themselves and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-garden is financed through the European Social Fund under the Human Resources and Employment Operational Programme, as well as the Czech Republic’s state budget.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of more than CZK 2.8 million) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding is exhausted (two years), the Arch.Design company is obliged to keep the mini-garden running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and in the submission of the application for funding contributed the company Economy Rating.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff, and a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The kindergarten currently hosts children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-garden", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to suit the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is a teaching and individual care, the contents of the mini-care programme are comparable to the usual pre-school programme.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Parents are more productive when they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the signing companies that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade reminiscent of scales and the ubiquitous gently curved lines, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, we observe a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Snake and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the gazebos and the signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the bustling shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia, emerged from the refurbishment of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of various apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project appeared ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
In the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s Güell Park, in which other pieces of it are found.
Due to its organic form, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones" shortly after its completion.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it "the house of yawning".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, appears the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed in the house a unique system for the time of central heating with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Its forty-five-degree inclination may be strange.
During the construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect the building rules of the time at all and did not allow himself to be influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked by the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was annoyed, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the city council’s request, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors was installed the owner himself.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without having to give up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction, not only got a new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most recharged apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that this is a very beneficial business and expanded the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, reaching 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry of other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> constructions into the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed atmosphere with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the mattress: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really imparts its quality to a good bed is the lying surface, that is, the mattress and the bedside.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented so that they are adapted to the specific users.
During the election, numerous items come into play, including the weight, height, health and gender of the owner.
It is also important the type of interior in which the mattress and the bedside table is placed.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend hut that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more frequently.
If the channels of the center are not properly aerated and, above, are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
“Almost every hockey player who returned from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their bruised shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"This type of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who weather nervous system problems, so they receive poor information from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem anymore, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turn like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
The viscoelastic also acts as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, e.g. single rooms, it is recommended at least between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunken towards your elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopová, Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> expert at decoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been specialized for many years in the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of the schools of furniture.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own bedside and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the frames at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
“When touching it with your hand or settling on the mattress, the springs should certainly not be noticed,” warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of bedside.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and you cannot wash their sheath, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give advice: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although mattress covers with zipper closure are currently manufactured all around their perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (something very important for the washing and the size of the washing machine!), their handling in the larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a bedside table, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
As much for the beds designed to spend a night the visitors.
However, you should make (if you don’t already have them) ventilation holes in the board and you should use it with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable sheet mattresses containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to use a sheet mattress with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar area are reinforced and their stiffness can be regulated.
Articulable sheets should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows the sheets to be pressed or even tilted in such a way that they "roll" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
They are even remembered by the manufacturers of mattresses who, in the "males", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross- or tablet frames with the so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and bedside, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mulky"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach to the shoulders, so that the muscles can relax.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder pad or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use more and more natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are in fashion.
The petroleum-based raw materials, from which the polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshed" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
Favorites currently?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic allows to manufacture mattresses from different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels goes.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who play a therapeutic role usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health care.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and mattresses.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is available free of charge.
The era of viscoelasticity with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and More Parents Use People Tracking Devices to Monitor Their Children
Fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatková.
At the moment the device has the approximate size of a match box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the expense of invading your privacy.
“We all try to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but about another way to decrease the chances of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases."
“Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková warns about the fact that if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even the youngest children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to prevent them from being controlled.”
“In the past, parents had a lot of confidence in mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková says.
In his opinion, it is debatable whether in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it is a prepared kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check whether the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is spreading, it will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be made with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
“The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period.”
“If you suffer damage, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question.”
“The more expensive devices have a built-in tilt meter, so if the person simply slips and stands still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with smartphones with navigation, in which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a similar size to a match box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason, tests are currently being conducted with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
“Or I identify him after a certain amount of time, which can save the police time,” he adds.
Even if the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology that is used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to encircle the whole Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the service life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the wick for explosives from the STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick a year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnics of the army, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that in such a case, such maneuvers should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
Neither Defence Minister Alexandr Vondr nor Army Captain Vlastimil Picek were exempt.
Only then could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid-intervention brigade recently complained personally to Minister Vondra because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even the practice of shooting for money is limited.
And let’s not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also don't get to understand that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of wick."
“But it’s their decision and they’ll undoubtedly know why they act like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we as a company try to satisfy,” admitted Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, commercial director of STV Group.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of kilometers of wick, saying he will also have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> of STV Group indicates that the wick has a shelf life of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, due to possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of wick, it got a discount.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said spokesman Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the Ministry of Defence’s shopping centre.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate munitions from World War II or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the right amount to deplete the ammunition before its useful life runs out.
This was decided for safety reasons for the pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I still live on the contacts I got thanks to the contest
The fact of winning the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun of Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered from seasonal jobs abroad and a loan from the bank he bought a house that was half demolished composed of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"At present, the value for money of the accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them back into the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, it has gradually opened in Liberec four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, it opened another of the same quality.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” the number one entrepreneur said last year.
“This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped to win the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ contest,” adds Pytloun gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity in both Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” she recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends everyone who wants to try a company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he continues to live on contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total about seventy.
“I’ve seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be involved in something that has gained general recognition.”
“It’s not my own personal success, it’s the result of the hard work of the entire team.”
"Only my name appears on the front page," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already gone through the worst.
The owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone "Company of the Year" contest last year at the "Slave House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition,” says last year’s winner.
The story of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not hesitate; he resigned from his position at the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, they founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized audience after achieving success in the contest in the media.
"Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners started to value collaboration with a company that was more successful in their country," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year was perhaps not Farmet just a show of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for the commercial results up to 2008 and, in part, 2009.
2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
“Obviously, we also don’t get away with such a situation.”
"Income fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even at lower levels than before the crisis.
In spite of everything, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence in the international market and obtained excellent valuations at national fairs," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All indications are that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues rise again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already succeeded in eliminating some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
“The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the business register when it carries out a check on the insured’s taxes,” said <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year it forms part of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny’s business tournament for the fourth time and also begins to create interest among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of 3,000 voters, this year it practically reached 4,000.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several overdue legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of papers needed for tax returns we are in the first place worldwide," comments Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was held for the first time in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Submissions can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for the "anti-award" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year's survey more than 100 were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that are meaningless.
The examples were sent by both businessmen and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s seventy proposals is published on the page of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event that usually involves personalities from the political and social world.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continuously puts obstacles on the employers, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations do not stay in the wild.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, intending to attend a stand at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that came second in number of votes in 2007, that is, the communication to the work office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third is the defeat.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their office a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny competition is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to support responsible and fair businesses.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of Vodafone Empresa’s main competition of the year 2010, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example the disabled, in others the personal or health problems of the employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they constitute more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Enterprise competition of the year it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc, accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also given to them because it primarily buys from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains businesswoman Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
The IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in Distress scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
They are also in a good position with a mention of the laundry company Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> from the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive special bonuses that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> of Bruntál Czasch's construction company, which won in the Moravian-Silesia region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all the regional finalists of the Vodafone Enterprise of the Year competition were automatically nominated who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organizers before August 15.
Organizers removed forms that were incomplete or erroneous from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company responsible contest of the year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company contest of the year."
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a sub-category of the main Company of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police have made several arrests at the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land was received by a specific interested party.
He had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelena told Pravo, adding that at the moment she cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
On how it could influence the public auction, given the little official information, one can only speculate.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>erná, a spokeswoman for the Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>erná Agricultural Fund, responded to Pravo’s questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the Pilsen headquarters and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our employees,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for land transfer in accordance with the law on land" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Depending on the bids, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the most bids," said the Fund's spokeswoman.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information on who was going to be invited to the call and, since he was also an interested person because he acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for some time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the site where a major road to the Borská pole industrial area should be built.
Afterwards, he changed them in a very beneficial way with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns per month
Since January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
As a result, families will have to take several hundred crowns more out of their wallet from January onwards than they do now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 more crowns a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have lowered prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately expensive, especially at a time when heating is most used and therefore higher consumption.
In this case, they must also have a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are priced across the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay an additional 50 kroner per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay an additional 1,000 kroner per year.
Prague residents will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent of infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the people of Prague will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to the courts those who do not agree with the new rent.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase by as much as 10% next year.
Czech young people get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors encountering such cases in the hospital’s pediatric admissions.
“Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get drunk.”
"Now the trend is strong alcoholic beverages," says Pravo, the head of pediatrics at Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikán.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their father's cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and doesn’t smell as much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman of Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use brandy that they picked up at home," adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are 13 and 14-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has worked since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances were taking young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture of ecstasy," the department's doctor said.
"He was at the Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at some dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t even surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance for drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, one cannot speak properly of dependence.
"Alcoholic is understood to mean a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is more due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” Chief Pelikan explains.
According to the spokeswoman Jurinová, this year at the pediatric clinic of Motol 40 drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, the statistics show only those who come with severe intoxication and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the walking medical examination, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink brandy, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs to mention: Witch’s Day, New Year’s Day and the end of the school year.
“In such a circumstance, they drink for poor grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
"On Witch's Day, I've seen up to seven drunken children in admissions at a time," Pelikan said.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These do it much better, because after the hectic night, they get up well and they don't hurt anything."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients can cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell them directly to the children how much it has cost their drunkenness and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a job for young people to make enough money to pay for themselves that night,” Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for the costs of treatment, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 planes found for the first time in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, left on Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
It is the first time that such a device has been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
At the time, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech army and was still in a flying state.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seater.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k of the Defense Press Department says it is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seater planes, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired planes, with no additional investment or contribution from the Ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army does not run out of two-seater aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for the amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged that aircraft will be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
“The contract clearly states that EADS is the company that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for pilot practices from NATO countries.”
"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how he will use them in this context," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské noviny newspaper published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction claims that the exchange promotes future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of domestic jets will likely have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already denounced the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by placing a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one is expected to arrive at Kbely Airport in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular are at lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to age 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Accordingly, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right indica finger shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same odds of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with an index longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer rate.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
Czechia, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday covered in snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered by compact snow and snow machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between km 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several industrial vehicle and passenger car accidents, as was the D1 road in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC5><0x99>edn<0xC3><0xAD>ho automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
In kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 crashed two industrial vehicles causing injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly behind Brno on kilometre 190 or cross Brno and be incorporated in kilometre 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
There have formed jams of several kilometers.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of several centimeters of snow and thermometers indicate -7 °C.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transportation is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and Nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At eight o’clock in the morning, another state of crisis will take place in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven trips by three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> airport was closed from 11 p.m. on Wednesday until 5 a.m.
Currently, you can already drive on most of the roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed in Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska, snow tongues are forming in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the area of the B<0xC3><0xAD>lé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
The roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, further in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snowfall gradually subsides in the Czech Republic.
U.S. soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known at the time only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" to victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun with extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function like a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall or trench.
Undoubtedly, normal protection cannot be used, and when it launches its killer rain of metallic chips, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then gets a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the line of projection and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is charged and thrown at a distance of 543 meters, plus one, two or three meters," Audette says.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant reported on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July the following year from its former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, another 100 more consortium employees, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franskurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday sparked joy among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt’s head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has earned him a “Global Player”.
This is a “magnificent recognition of the location.”
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management previously informed the city of its intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the computer manufacturer’s good contacts with the property owner at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
In such a way, there is now a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building are cooperative."
The building formerly used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years from a controversial project to build the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city council, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is in charge of criticism in terms of the massive building that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and appraisal companies were installed, the software manufacturer for booking systems, Start Amadeus, as well as then merged Siemens with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world’s third-largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, yet Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name TDS.
That is why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The ancient complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly taking hold of WikiLeaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind it lies political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly detained in England.
The WikiLeaks revelations platform is always the target of ever stronger criticism in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently searching for an Internet homeland in Europe.
US Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"WikiLeaks expelled from Amazon server."
“To speak freely in the country of freedom,” the revelations activists communicated via the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company, Amazon, had removed the WikiLeaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to publishing secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Perfectly, we will spend our dollars hiring people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with free speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon halted its use of its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported in a call to Lieberman’s office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I had hoped that Amazon would take these steps before, prior to previous publications of classified information through WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and disregardful WikiLeaks process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to spread stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently branded the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
WikiLeaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why there is fear for Assange’s safety, Hrafnsson said.
The location of the founder of WikiLeaks remains unclear.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee said the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, a dispute is growing.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed an exceptional commissioner, the White House announced.
Travers is responsible for developing “important structural reforms” that are necessary in the light of WikiLeaks leakage.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to take care of the security of dissidents and activists, they must endanger the publication of WikiLeaks.
“We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are prepared to help protect them if necessary.”
The University of Ice Cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream actually come from?
From the gelatine and the gelatine.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The gelato takes out the ice cream from the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the bar and sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the university of ice cream with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an irritating job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice-creamer Luciano Ferrari then explains to the participants the ideal qualities of perfect ice-cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the cream cover of the national superior house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it to four degrees.
Then open the faucet of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a stabilizer?
How can you unleash some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that they get rid of the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not just natural ingredients", has probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, from guar beans.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit or sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"However, you must experience it sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use the freezers.
Luciano lets them each time produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
What you know best doesn’t necessarily depend on whether you have more toffee scent or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to taste like nuts, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, says Luciano.
Ice cream making is a problem of artimetics: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, you have to reduce the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he fixes the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the utensil for the automatic preparation of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
In spite of everything, all automation is left out as far as the small pasta is concerned.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were a giant mini-primer without control.
“In every course,” says teacher Luciano, “it is only a matter of time that something like that goes by.”
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This issue is currently formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven’t documented it well,” Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa’s group of experts on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert are also hired for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortiums such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer pay for it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on Efsa’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, placing him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the company’s deed, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed its side with that.
Recently, the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as a clairvoyant EU parliamentarian.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, is used as long as they are of a high technical quality and are ordered in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
On this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that GM plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” asks the accuser.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute in Zurich.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying, in the US and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a rule.
“Industry controls safety research,” Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba on his back.
There were demonstrations
- Nevaba.
The story is well known: In September the excavators arrived and began to take down a large chunk of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was made debris.
Rotate in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, the smoke from cigarettes has smelled.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest in Tübingen in a former ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He has bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the garbage dump," he says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the shooting company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing for the downing.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram massif cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the forest, the rest long ago sold.
Owner of gardens, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
Ascended to its off-road, it takes a tour of its large 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
He is a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures all over Germany.
It is said to be the largest dealer of ancient stones in the country.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic sandstones chopped.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge," he explains.
Limestone dawn, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And keep going.
"Beautiful travertine."
Formerly, the massifs belonged to the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart Police Headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a cart, he feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
It has not become rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to the stone dealer, in addition to stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glass worker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Struggle for talents around great potentials
An active influx reigns in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the muffins, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalizing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a melee fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: to hire as soon as possible the most talented students from universities, before they enter the labor market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not provide publications about their students’ skills, they try to peek at exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes pens, rubber and folders with the VW logo.
He explains the internship programs and student jobs to the enthusiastic young talents and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
You see advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“In turn, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point previously was in the technical projects," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not, they have to be announced and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineer jobs in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineer gap will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through the coordinates of the GPS.
The company wants to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to pick and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey alone was short."
For the Dykta talent hunter the notes give results.
“So far we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants.”
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at the specialty fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company's website.
"It's very difficult to fill the vacant positions."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example the University of Freiberg.
"Professors advise that you can do internships with us or do your theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't normally offer it," says Stübe, the staff manager.
When looking for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, the staff manager, also expects extra points in her ranking for her aspirants to work.
“I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external rankings of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies who want a long-term strategy to gain good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers with more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Internal Employer Branding, also promoting corporate identity within the workforce itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a resounding ban and with it annulled its previous plans in an unappealable manner.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast are new holes closed for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What prompted this strict ban, which will at least be in effect for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the misfortune that claimed the lives of eleven workers and provoked the largest environmental catastrophe in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the reliance of the US on new oil supplies from abroad.
It has not yet been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable tide in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium following the explosion.
Subsequently, various peterolero consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible supervisory authority, which after being accused of corruption has fallen into disrepute, is reforming at its root.
Obama is announcing that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortiums will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
“Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current poll conducted by the advisory firm BDO – ahead of Wednesday’s mining ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are protracted for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
River water is oil marble, smells like a gas station: Millions of litres of spilled crude have shattered nature in Nigeria’s Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari seems fine.
“Don’t get tired,” the environmental activist reassures journalists: “Today enough oil will pass before your eyes.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the glow of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil spots float on the surface.
Previously, she used to pick prawns in handfuls here, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the flowing waters are totally dead.
Five years ago an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish from around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: which, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the stinkiest regions in the world.
In the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship’s engine removes a brown broth, which submerges its hand in the water, pulling out some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as always: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silenced, a sort of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with the smell of a gas station expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Celestine Akpobari, "we live in constant danger to our health."
The war comparison proceeds.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a fierce battlefield for years: Here more than 60 years ago the first European explorers broke out, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here he had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today the return of companies to Ogoniland is prohibited: While more than two million barrels of black gold were pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms protruded like quirky water sculptures: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari thinks, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to expert assessments, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell’s consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaky pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell primarily applies low safety standards typically in the world to conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are “over a greater multiple than elsewhere.”
In a place, which from afar seems forgotten, appears a workshop full of oil under the free sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered with oil.
Between one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the boreholes, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire burns: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-liter diesel daily: "It gives us 34,000 naira," about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers" who rigged the pipeline network that runs through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this point, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally refined: organized criminal networks, to which also belong politicians and senior military officials, keep the best part in tanks and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate to be purely academic about whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the management of the population or to the loose mode of production.
“If the oil companies did not behave as invasive and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as the Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says the muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the special army unit catches illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
“This damn invention has completely shattered our country,” Akpobari said.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety issue.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce "a catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than you can imagine: Australian aviation safety authorities perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s thanks to their investigations, and they warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal measures against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that made further legal action against the company possible.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct more safety tests on the superjumbos endowed with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue has become important enough to inform everyone affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A nationwide Nevada causes traffic chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
Chaos reigns in many streets, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Freezing temperatures were reached throughout the country on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the snow removers are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of swirling it.
There were many trucks and cars trapped during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported major street disturbances.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia the snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn, major upheavals are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the lanes or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokeswoman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snowscrews are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred in the vicinity of Nuremberg because of the snowy streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overturning her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be softer and more dust-like and will therefore swirl in gentle streaks.
But the wind will wane.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for buyers for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Recently Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: the twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt bank quarter; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to take advantage of the costs of the overhaul, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not name the reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check if it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution relinquishes its company’s headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached figures of around 200 million euros.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the deaths of miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The corpses have not yet been found, because the security measures are still precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago an intense explosion took place in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of the misfortune, but found no sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to go down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent brightness of the sun at Greymouth on New Zealand’s southern island.
They kept quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal belongings, underneath clothing and surfboards.
The flags waved half-mast in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand hoped miners would return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand government president John Key told participants at the memorial.
"But they never came home."
She cannot assume her son’s death until she has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Alongside the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand’s southern island.
As soon as the explosive gases have been removed, scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, police superior Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does the gore fit in artistic cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior imprisoned with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip his enemies from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are quiet and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous landscapes of Scotland, which the backstage offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has several groups of recipients it is a shame that they cannot be mutually discarded.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the "Pusher" drug-dealing hair trilogy as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works be for all audiences with a bit more humor in the mainstream or a little less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and sprouting guts cannot deter most fans of artistic cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck for an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts up there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a piece of cinema sometimes exciting, that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a little blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, preserves something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
Over the midnight of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of Euphrates; the largest and nearest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with help from North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that flows out of the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA in late April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the El-Kibar vicinity very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique serves hardly any other purposes than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had been in operation for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is barely more known than at the time, the riddles grew larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was totally certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in Kibar, but that it saw little indication that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a “supposed reactor”, although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible”.
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat responded in the summer lapidarily that the IAEA has "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly cleared the debris of the alleged “unused military building” and deliberately raided the ground.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in al-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial sellers in the moments just after the attack, which must have greater informational value than presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, controllers are forbidden a second inspection at al-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "is progressively becoming a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally a serious violation against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, for which the IAEA watches is pending.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not yet made public what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., has identified these sites and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, most likely one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located in or immediately next to a military base, Syria forbids entry to all three sites to the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that Syrians fear a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alert to the equipment thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is being moved between the three sites and the bucket on the bank of the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities,” of uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is driven with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium for the bombs should subsequently be separated, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are located in all three places.
As the hundreds of truckloads disappeared from the ground, no one knows where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located within a few kilometres from Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as an area for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of the satellite imagery for the prestigious Jane’s Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that the Syrians carried out land movements at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly contributes to dispelling suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent some months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians allowed, to maintain the possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador fencing the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the IAEA director, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of “an option to which I am open in the future”, but is still hesitant.
This path is very risky: it requires a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for an escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her still unnamed debut.
She has written the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have quickly protested, with which at the last minute they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered her a meeting in Hungary which she rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on it defies the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended the removal of Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted after a shoot and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go anyway.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and they meet again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
Jolie’s movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
They can currently achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon it's finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream with joy as the loud music resounds, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in the South Irish Cork, because the players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this bizarre drinking game and the discreet computer really don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what will the future hold.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he got the job of his dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT advisor in London.
The young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economics experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin forecast.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave is coming comparable to that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis is confusing above all the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far everything is uphill.
Loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, he leaves and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future appear because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They lower minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
Observe how your peers go from one unpaid practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career,” says the manager.
On her website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish construction colleagues in Germany.
Now they are building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan only rarely sees his homeland because he works overtime to pay a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, since it was a long time since he first stepped on the threshold of his home.
“I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I’m never so good.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes into icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O’Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer does not like the complaints he often hears today.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as it was in times past here on the island,” he said.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Keep an eye on the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He already worked a couple of years in London and why wouldn’t he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just not too many emotions,” he says and gives a big drink to his beer.
"Goodbye, sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is more worrying than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows for the monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor that reigns in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a drop of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a major decline in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see graph 2).
Around 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it was maintained during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in conditions of poverty increased only marginally in 2009 and that it has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent say they or a close relative have fallen victim to crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year, the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in greater support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private enterprises are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the greatest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (versus 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the trash
No one expected the November 28 general election in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners feared trying to help the country recover from its troubles.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the sewers, polling stations destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges were opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that they were “a relatively good election in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that “we do not think that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which its opponents say is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
All hopes for the elections have not yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Celestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Considering that the cholera epidemic is raging the country and more than one million earthquake survivors still live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government to be an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has become clear, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving Points to the Center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, whether it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election will depend on whether the clearly affected Ms. Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who remained in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have clashed with Ms. Fernández.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
The 2010 budget, accordingly, will be applied to next year, which will give the president an even greater scope for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, put it close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had the INDEC, the statistical institute, adjust official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez moderate these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
Inflation, however, has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that’s why Ms. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it appears that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices to national consumption, which seems the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If it does, it will need to gain the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
By the time the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not you will reluctantly repudiate many of your husband’s policies.
Half a hurrah for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of eligible voters, came on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to win the majority of the vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has leaned toward total independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections could be seen, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls in dancing clothes.
Nor did the mysterious attempted murder of rigor fail.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, KMT honorary president, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or get revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean on the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that this was not the issue of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids publicizing its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time, too, the PPD avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr. Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy with respect to China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
It would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best thing to do is wait for the 2012 presidential election to happen.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, he openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything it can to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious at the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma’s valuations have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT says it will restructure its cabinet as well as local teams.
Large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Revelation Artist category.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammys’ surprises this year with a high-level nomination for Best Revelation Artist.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives reason to think, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which it must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a breakthrough and, considering her light and pleasant vocal style, as well as great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, at least a distinction can be made between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have lately been concentrated in the jazz category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley with "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a shrill favorite in New Orleans and regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy’s savage punk James Argue’s Secret Society garnered well-deserved recognition in the big-group category, competing against the Billy Childs Ensemble’s great chamber jazz and ever-risk Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, “Pathways,” was a great example of the bassist’s democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Album Direction
Classical music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic orchestra of three movements.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his No. 4 symphony, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories encompassing orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer of the year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium" of the Castificum and the Art.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and corsta.
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassyonamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed “Los Angeles” and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the ordering commission
The mosque project for Temecula has gained unanimous support from the local ordering commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimonies.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Baha’is, of all religions,” Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“The truth is, as an American citizen, I’m proud.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They just speak very loudly.”
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o’clock in the afternoon and lasted practically until midnight; most of the time was dedicated to people who interceded for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“The United States no longer exists,” reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near zone zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living together seamlessly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it is little short of a truly 'alien' kind of way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, who co-authored the report in Thursday's online edition of Science.
There are six major elements essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, may continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, who co-authored the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know how it looks.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on the Monkey Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one with another.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
“Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them.”
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, to put it one way, it overwhelms the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may naturally exist, either in other parts of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but an example that proves it works has never been found.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of Earth, he said, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“It does suggest that there might be other ways to generate life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing stolen dogs found in Compton
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup truck they were spending the night in, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two found each other Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that the dogs are doing well,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
“They’re back with their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
“We don’t want to say anything,” Whitmore said.
“We’re following some leads.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found for comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's aides found the van and the two dogs separately at Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been damaged.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and were intending to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to exhibit in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the nearly two-month tour of the couple taking part in dog competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van on Tuesday at 6 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, as MGM’s restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the “pre-arranged” plan by creditors to erase roughly $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering films and TV shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a reduced studio.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320.
In reality, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial hardships and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multi-billion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a "successful fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one movie this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-fund two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to balance its gift budget
While the iPad is the top candidate to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic beads-adorned jumping ropes, or about 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And toys powered by button batteries are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are for Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and more) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when they tighten their bellies.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to assemble a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shifting games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative articulated wheeled feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a volume control.
If you’re an 80s kid, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with letters of questions designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correcting exercise notebook occurring.
If you are suspicious of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although the games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, ages 3 to 12), it is the first major tweak in the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot for viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game barely larger than a box of matches, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by putting the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s formidable for an impromptu word-weaponing competition.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle on your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-battered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, China’s voluminous urban order policemen, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and inclination to violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "How pretty girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teens wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants for attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, contemptuously.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish-green color of the uniforms to a purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating gazes: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a disco of snack carts, and watched it constantly frowned for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the coarse police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s diminutive respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after using his cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the internet, describing how to effectively whip criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a quarrel with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for “a really meticulous cleanup.”
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered if women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s notice called for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They must have been above average height, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
“First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
Female chengguans are like vases, she said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
“We can’t allow a lame person or a humpback to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his colored cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t believe the accent in her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimple co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don’t oppose their work on a timely basis, they said, because they harbor career ambitions greater than simply chasing salespeople away in the alleys where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces roughly a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many muffins or bowls of tofu as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle trims.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is more or less the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, mutinied after false rumors spread that chengguan officials had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the nightly episode; 14 government vehicles were dumped or set on fire.
So far Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calmness is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike screamed rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the bad-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said quite naturally.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not file charges against Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the senator announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have excused Senator John Ensign for criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure work through lobbying for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it was “certainly pleased” with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobby ban.
Interviews, email and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain lucrative lobbying work to silence Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to disagree with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, amid charges of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the following day, telling him the department did not want to bring charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins declined to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable going into detail about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help to Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was "crushing" the Interior Ministry over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign’s spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign wishes to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent out reports of the appalling testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is set to come to an official end, with the death penalty judge’s imposition voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court filings outlining the arguments for appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reporting on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“According to what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the rights of the individual to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State High Court laconically dismissed the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that celebrity case coverage can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to media outlets.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the television show and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way of communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, 48-year-old Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela.
Defense attorneys say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict over his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a recusal of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood to the fire of excitement over the case.
"The daily crowding of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and maybe all over the state."
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than reports delivered more slowly, was a ludide view that would make the court’s policy on coverage control weak in future lawsuits.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often attracted to arguments about adaptation that were required in court because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard’s conviction because of the process’ coverage, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media would require new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century.”
Can civics build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a notable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has sparked a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But by what they all say, it was at least a courteous discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as an acknowledgment of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn party points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the remaining political differences between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates the members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a probationary period, probing each other to identify signs of cooperativeness and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan war.
The reason why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and deeply ingrained to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides find themselves at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed with regard to how things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then go extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make them believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism over a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will turn the situation into a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civics can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The motives have much to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As aware as Republican leaders are of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut state spending and nullify the new health care law.
These lines of support are already evident in the initial reactions to the deficit commission’s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age, and spending cuts.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have forced the deficit issue into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there is, at least at present, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would change bring about?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as it did in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they are losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanity and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there appears to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “kleptocracy,” and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money that it collects directly from the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has termed “vertical authority,” takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Lushkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he said: "It's madness, a hoax, a nuisance."
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government to crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government," the statement said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term from the criminal world and the mafia literally meaning ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
“Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow’s criminal world.”
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level.”
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the money collection is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed down for one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats,” Georgy Satarov, director of Indem’s Moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
“But he’s a part of this bureaucracy.”
“He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from at least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not occur until late Moscow time, will surely cause displeasure within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure, and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed UN and Cambodia court issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the well-known Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to re-integrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian-Thai border.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of Western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the utter misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have made little profit after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised without any concept to do business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before living as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-sufficiency."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases other than those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district head in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
During a recent murky afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is reuniting the broken pieces,” he said.
“It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces together so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first 75-page government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called A History of Democratic Kampuchea.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little detail about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But her parents reacted with skepticism when she took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they are not sure about how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered in discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here over a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman by the roadside, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
“But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him,” he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas hoping for good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its reserve of qualified uranium for weapons
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will relinquish its highly enriched uranium stockpile, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the past two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity because of the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the deal was "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama vowed in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-qualified uranium) and low-enriched uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material ... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell them to anyone."
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been lightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the installation of low-enriched uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official with the Department of Energy working on Global Threat Reduction, said that “this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen trust” that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential detente.
“While progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not complain about CIA flights.
The Spanish government made no objection to the CIA’s flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners heading to Guantanamo Bay on Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by WikiLeaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed in order to "prove that they were exercising appropriate surveillance on foreign planes that pass through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in anti-human rights practices, a meeting took place between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice president acknowledged that the Council’s report had “taken Zapatero’s government out of play” and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain has no concerns about intelligence flights through Spanish territory.
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “pushed unprepared,” Aguirre recounts in a cable.
Also the then head of Foreign Affairs, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge’s initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between U.S. Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses concern about the PP’s performance in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The parricide confession complained in the network of the "agobio" of being a mother
The girl talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used from a young age, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a people from which she came.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through the testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tu<0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
It wasn't long before she met him again.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even went with her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and musqueado, because I have come to work."
"When I told him it seemed good, but of course, now he realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
Then, he talks about a message to the phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, “If you don’t like me leaving the kid with my mother, I’ll pick him up when he comes back,” she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job so as not to lose it."
He clarifies that if everything goes well, he takes his firstborn.
“He’s going to be with who he owes, that is, with me, and I’ll never think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
“On one hand he’s with me and he likes the site a little bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there for some summer classes, and that's how I save some babysitting pasta."
The 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very great kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes so that he can learn Catalan."
From Victor, your current partner, there's one: "He's giving me money."
On the internet there are his messages on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now intervened, where she called herself "Muki the Executioner."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, who is sworn in, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial penitentiary of Palma, from the detention center of Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "or have intended to cause any harm to the child."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has its eyes on the general elections because, whether it is advanced or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in these elections usually doubles the number that it receives in the Catalan elections.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the regionals of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
On Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (has 25).
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - now it has three - while ICV would either keep one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate meeting will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relay at the head of the Provincial Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the socialists would not obtain a majority or the possibility of turning to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be insane that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it needs to get 5% of the vote - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can lead the turnaround in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has stood only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan Cell Provides Thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the Police Information General's Office in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the latter of the bombings in Bombay.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" at the international level and, therefore, its operational capacity.
The researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were counterfeited and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combatants” can cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence the fact that in addition to the Thai services, other European police units have participated in the investigations, so it is not excluded that in the coming days similar coups will be carried out in the territory of the EU.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another one was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistanis Butsan Kik Kandhim and Muhammad Athar Buthar
These were the ones who led the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists who met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents must be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigation underlines that, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the bombing of Bombay, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency some thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and which are summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and dispensing with philo-sovereignist adventures, as is the economic concert that the leader in nationalist wants.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting of Artur Mas with the assurance that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make himself like, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
From a possible understanding with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independenceist speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to thinning the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomous administration and eliminating the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Mas will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatrician La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while he was there employee killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, attended accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the indictment against the person responsible" for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
In addition to the social disrepute that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the custodian in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and has not stopped killing since.
The judge already pointed out in the car ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally scanned the deceased but that, depending on the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, yesterday vehemently denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there is not a single indication in the case that there has been a reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself.”
The man named "Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he died by taking an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed by helping with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the center’s staff have access to medicines.
The insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed to the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the custodian’s demonstrations, or even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from Trichet that warned "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
Peripheral spreads have been tightly closed and shares of European banks have risen more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the ECB’s ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely picked up, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that just as it collapses is recovered but motivated by closing short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary liquidity measures on time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend current liquidity measures “at least until March” and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond buying program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they don’t meet expectations they will reverse the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting in which they said they had not even contemplated buying bonds and collapsed markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday it said it had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday, the one-year letter auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment behind Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to spot the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are assumable within the aid plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political compromise is needed that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment sound in the ears of investors like the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will resolve with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes access to the markets without.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, it must appear."
Courage, we can.
The president of Eulen will challenge the board of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm does not amaze in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null in full", the judicial board of El Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning the legal drums for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control on the part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services to the company does not seem willing to yield in his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
He was dismissed from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judiciary of El Enebro for next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder in the bosom of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants their five children to, through procedural cunning, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and heal the radically null junta of January 18," according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the board to proceed with its challenge once it has been held, considering that it is "full-fledged null".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a wealth company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the seven children of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive matter for the judge to decide once the hearing on the challenge is held, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Ever since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the skill as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor from the capacity of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make him a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from the high car competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly lines of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most celebrated utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument at its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement “in just a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull engines with the exception of the engine, which is entirely the responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological refinement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend at most each season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its Bolides in a town about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visitors are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The squad for this task amounts to 580 people, including his two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is, without a doubt, the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety null.
The plant’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in wagon cars contributed 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators."
In two years, HP will set up its own 20 stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom he has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP Personal Systems said that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and takes care of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishment staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of retailers aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets to ‘steal’ one million customers from rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
Despite this, it foresees a plunge in interest margins, which will be attempted to offset in part by increases in fees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract in three years one million private customers, his pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will run for three years.
The goal, in addition to surviving without resorting to public aid from FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if you discount those who can leave the bank -, its large pending subject, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges will be exposed by the bank when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has upended all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets caused it to expand one more exercise.
Customers who let out savings banks will be their primary goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the liabilities war — which penalizes margins — is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and coffers are paying for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already shifting to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a factor of pressure on credit.”
"We haven't closed the faucet, but the spreads are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of spreads - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "greater sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
It states that capital needs are "up a lot" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
And he points out that the FROB can replace the market in raising funds in the face of new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it downplayed what some bankers already predicted as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, several entities assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out that this new wave of operations will occur.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Banking group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments.”
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that too," said the director.
Speaking during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is happening in the deadlines that in his day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain ", he emphasized.
Moving from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion assets to 17.5 billion is an unprecedented process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basel.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in markets have prompted a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed people without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
Go ahead that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the currency zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, even if it now looks like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to transgressing countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were spurring deficits, the German government pulled a constitutional reform off its sleeve to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans for fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
Already then it was the object of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the EU treaties, to make it possible to save a country while at the same time forcing private lenders to run for part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even though we now have to take measures with which he perhaps does not agree very much, from that date the old operation of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary area, in which violating countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, is simply not going to tolerate it.
The envoy is clear.
And it would be wrong not to understand it.
It’s not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater peace of mind.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood it this way and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has made its way.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a currency zone too crowded with unreasonable countries, cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos to Ajax show ingenuity but no willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly caused by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink to be written about whether such behavior is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, short of a few minutes to finish the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time to make fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will already end up as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the case is due to the fact that it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, apparently by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic technician and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit fraud by law; because, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sports regulation, but they seem to circumvent their meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets that comprises the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to by fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of the law, because his violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the punishment.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders gain in the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that you do not put the opponent in a disadvantageous position or make a profit in the same game, because obviously the result of the action means leaving the team itself with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first exchange, and also with this performance the players meet a penalty game and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, from passing rounds, it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor to get the most out of what the rules allow.
In the present case, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or running away from it.
Although the boundary between ingenuity and law fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was about two self-evictions and because of the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them took place.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
Self-sufficiency celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferating.
Like the hurricane and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas group dinners also return, which continue to work as an oxygen balloon for the catering and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, the associations of the sector and the company agree.
To complicate the accounting, this year’s calendar (at the fall of New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the lean cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners due to budgetary issues.
In order not to do without tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both sides demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restauración Gremi, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict what the festivities of this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
"He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the price issue," he says.
The business will do well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A poll in several central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of applications for that Friday, with the pretension of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done our best to maintain last year’s prices, with menus for all tastes ranging from 19.95 to 30 euros.”
In AN Grup, which abuts El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, remain optimistic after detecting a turnover boom from the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
The group’s sources point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green sprouts in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, hopes to start to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "lively", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
Of course, the illusion for the festivities has not descended, pay who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at “a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than going on increasing, is "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program – that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack – is one of the main reasons for awakening in Washington.
This is what Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson enumerates in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-attacked territory, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of transporting atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to guard.
“Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev told a meeting with his US counterparts.
The newest of the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-increasing US-Pakistani cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high rate of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which described communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," said: "Transparency is often nonexistent; offers of aid are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistani Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track the moves and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but it dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
The lawyer for WikiLeaks creator Mark Stephens said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called network notice free to proceed with an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police force - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be there.
The movement has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in unknown whereabouts, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy at the U.N. in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to downplay Assange contrasts with views proclaimed these days by conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the Homeland Security Committee in the lower house, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone who gives them any contributions or aid.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, who has had to retract after saying Assange should “be murdered.”
“Obama should make it a target and use a drone or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than the execution would be too kind a punishment," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to overcome the nth internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his desire to resign is insufficient for the likes of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not at all cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winks that allow him to armour himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that ERC’s more than 200 national advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
Through ballots, not by hand.
If the Carotistas want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
Carod’s proxies demand more from the president than to put his office at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the highest organ between congresses.
But because they don’t have the majority enough to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for him promising to advance the congress to the fall of 2011, something that the dome already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that “polyphony” impairs stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, able to wash dirty door rags inward.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovació assumed that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he numbered five, of which two stand out.
The first, to “recompose” the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces coming from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate the assembly as a working mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held through elected delegates.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsed conclave of 2008 left the management with the task of reviewing the assembly at a specific congress for reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of the last few years did not advise tackling the issue.
Now, without critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to resume and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO Estado de México, there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO Estado de México.
Among the murders are three women and the discovery of a couple of bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the grace shot in the head in addition to the wired feet and hands.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of an abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
In the early hours of Thursday, ejidatarios found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, on the stretch that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a message signed allegedly by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed with eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a bullet impact on the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the forehead was found the corpse of a man on a lonely road of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a hammered cap of 25 caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the other members of the body, but were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse that was in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, which was tied with hands back and head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two death warning messages.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony Valle de los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony he was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of his body with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located that was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os according to a message that his executioners left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the back of the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Holy Death, as well as necklaces with her image.
In the latter part of the month, the body of a man was found aboard a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with their heads wedged and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed allegedly by a criminal organization that said: "This happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and bound feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon ribbon and next to a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juarez.
Next to him the agents found a cardboard with a message.
Maintains China's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals
The representative of the country at COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institution building; and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which sets out the goals set for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities, to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and governments of other countries, are underway or have already been completed.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for changing incandescent spotlights for savers and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government’s scientific advisor on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and expects to do the same by 2020.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former Panista leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what is appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
“Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Order Commission of the National Council, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body,” he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never at the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will come out strengthened from the internal election on December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panista leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he said.
He said the council will no doubt know how to choose the best or best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the courier "to whomever the council determines."
“I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president.”
He predicted that the rebound that the party recorded in the last July 4 elections will be reflected in the upcoming disputes, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this framework, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations."
When asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the Priists to reflect on the six-years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the Zedillo and Salinas governments were better than the Fox and Calderón governments, let them start defending them, let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He felt that the head of the federal executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag or much less censorship.
Obama promotes Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted on Twitter.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with senators, given that the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
“I think we can get a deal at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “closing-debate vote” for the Dream Act, whereby the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years, and have entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the bill, requiring a handful of Republicans to take part as supporters of the bill star in intense lobbying to ensure the bill is passed.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act need to add several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they won’t back it another time.
Another Republican who supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Tongue was a walk where the participants showcased the narration.
"That of sex in the tongue I understand, but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and that this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was explained).
The finger in the sore... "it puts us in trouble", the Argentine writer sweetly squeezed to the public, mostly young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the "scourge" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist comes convinced: "Patience is not my strong, maybe it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very intermediary.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also exposed a delightful narration that he titled Praise of the invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but at a moment is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, tells of a famous sorceress, who touched the same clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, narration that turned to speak later America, the great novel that did not lack from the beginning his own chroniclers that told it and quoted Bernal Diaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses.
"Cervantes who invented us all [the writers] made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise one would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking to the point of modesty."
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the deceivers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that the narrated belongs to one side or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
It is called the “Cervantine Tradition.”
"By his inheritance we are what is counted."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero embraced and applauded the variety of interpretations that led to the FIL’s invitation with her round table The Finger in the Wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican woman pointed her own towards the great scourge of social violence that is going through her country -and shares Latin America - as a result of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs enclose a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
“To be masters of our thinking and masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting a finger on the sore and disturbing those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, black and white, established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already reached the decisive series on three occasions, although so far it has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian has ended up consoling himself with the medal of the runner-up, has stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he was in charge of Morelia with which he fell for the overall 4-2 against Toluca; subsequently, in the Closing 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with the overall of 3-1 and it was precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Devils, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choristeros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put in a 3-1 lead with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the flip 4-3.
Rubén already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to break away from the spell and be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and therefore the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the helmsman said when questioned about the numbers he has against playing the finals.
"The only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to run out and I think that's a lesson, until the game is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shootouts, something that does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we hoped that we made a bad end, sometimes we left something for the title, we were not nervous or anxious to have".
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up coach and prove for the first time the glory that the titles give.
I change the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to Visa Applicant Service (ASC) centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one more for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for petition visa cases (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because the biometric information will be taken from the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in this shorter time than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Finding of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will make an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the one in charge of studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present “a finding that will impact the search for extraterrestrial life,” prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that creatures exist alongside us and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Monkey Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this ability increases the chance that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that “there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know.”
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in the Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, were "throning" against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it initiates 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his character of vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overrun again by both parties and with that the opposition coalition ended.
“So far it has come (the opposition coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress after having been monopoly, now be "duopolic."
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipatism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 lawmakers, and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'loot' between two, in reference to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just a game, now they’re distributing it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
“That not by coupular agreements, leave out 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform.”
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
The City of Mazatlan pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company, amounts to 1 million 200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re simply being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as marked by the Law when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The above, after July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination is taken care of and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the streets and the banquets has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn around the nearby businesses.
“Politicians do not know what it is to close a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or else they would not do the works in this way for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not fall only in the corrective," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be given the maintenance, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look sloppy and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito de Mazatlan.
"Today, in order for the tourist to come, it is not solely dependent on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"There has not been due attention and this kind of facts highlights something that is notorious to everyone, maintenance is needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of touristic vocation.
"Fortunately, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A law of decent work and free of agreements between parties and the state executive demands the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday the 60 legislature has been installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 deputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which adds a total of 40 people's representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the new 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that the deputies will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to watch over their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
Hence, he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to move forward the Governor in turn.
"We work for them to do a decent job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Islands Hotel Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is to push economic growth, to generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation.”
Regarding tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give it the weight it carries within the state budget to strengthen the State Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for tourism projects that are detonating and that help in giving security to the state and in updating the Alcohols Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
Looking for a Magic King
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the yearning of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Kings’ Day will be difficult to please their illusions, as their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and live to the day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no bed, but we sell mandarin and potatoes ... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10, aspires for a long time to have a 'monster' car and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothing size for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I said to him, 'Let's go see son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children who were in school, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, lacks tennis, so a pair of five and a half or six would be of great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Find a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the reception in Northwest.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions took place as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sale network.
Fourteen people have been arrested who will face various charges.
Persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec Security.
A total of eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke Courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come after a long investigation that has lasted nearly a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests,” Mr. Ruel said.
This police operation involved about seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
The fight against clandestine migration can be fought without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of the paterras loaded with illegal migrants, is likely to face major opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I find myself here with a party that has created the granite that you step on," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for up to a year’s detention of anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The NDP’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those responsible for the clandestine patters and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” said Ms. Chow.
“We don’t support the Conservatives bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs they don’t tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada, and they treat the country like a mat.”
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a confidence vote on its bill, which could lead the country to an election as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has communicated to the QMI Agency that the government will request a vote so that each MP who is going to oppose will be explained later to their voters.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement caught more than one person by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services held on October 29, this measure was never debated despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this announcement as "a rabbit out of the box" and as "a bumpy last-minute solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he simply says.
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ president Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest is stubborn in avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide,” he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Registrar General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the Comptroller General,” he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the Registrar the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only emerging project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also called on Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcyclist groups, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions experienced heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the snow melt that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Center, for its part, issued announcements Wednesday communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Wolf.
Partially Blame Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain setback before the Canadian Radio Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding welfare and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council also noted that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not misleading.
In connection with suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life ' s problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any guilt has been dismissed in this regard.
The last litigation concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media clash that had sparked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether those in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
“My file has been clean for a year and a half,” the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio network has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the station, which must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of greatest audience within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar route.
The athlete, who excels in "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance professionally.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy playing on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held from October 23 to 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won in the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
“I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China.”
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
“At this stage, I’ll be the first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sand" is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to hit with the fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only maintain a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
“It’s been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“The one who has won me is a real professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
“The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category.”
“Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.”
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and cause a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition.”
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," Quebec Party deputy Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there had been a collusion with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted “dishonestly” and “with a lack of rigor.”
He said the "minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortia formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without the competition coming into play; it has been a negotiation.
In addition, the consortia formula has ceased to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As published last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortiums in the technical advisory sector is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec business register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, that is, Dessau.
Regarding the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'energy de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
“You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we’re going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and at a good price.”
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people,” Mr. Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the Energy Stewardship contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that they are rather their leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More environmentally friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer hardly relies on sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade brands and eco-certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that defend more responsible consumption are swarmed, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even slows down his commitment.
Even if the consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the advertising of environmentalists, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates that carry so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this consumer sector, which is currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of information cause 46% of consumers to reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the alleged yields of the organic products or services they are trying to sell.
Nearly half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, notes the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to take the place of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be from outside doors: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this large behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support cycling and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and El Parallèle, who were expecting a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to repurchase the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard from Daniel Langlois and return it to its true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, be less than the initial expectations; this could be a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a 12.8 million application last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
El Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector do call for considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried the burden of the author's cinema in its premises for ten years, after financing its own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and El Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to screen films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, showing the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals they have received.
The veil of complex Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. sees as the complex of Canadians vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, that is, during a full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador envoy to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives some explanations of this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent to Canadians in dealing with everyday domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Accordingly, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party leader and even more so of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the government’s survival during the vote of confidence in the federal budget in early February, by which Canada will for the first time in the last decade register a deficit due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties condition its survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerts Washington to the increasingly negative image broadcast by drama series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that it depended "on each case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, “he has given a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.”
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that moods have warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
In the United States they echoed Mike Huckabee.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilize the planet’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of concrete major projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuing countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should be lowered to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from getting out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluorescent compact bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is further reduced by twice as much.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they do not contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have expressed their reservations regarding fluorescent compact bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless instructions are given by manufacturers.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluorescent compact bulbs, but coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, given that the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” said a spokesman for the UN chief.
“It calls on all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed Wednesday’s deadline to be passed at midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday’s poll.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission was "continuing to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo side counts on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, at the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director for the president of C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, said that the intimidation of voters carried out by the United Nations in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be nullified if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents consider that the country’s highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in the publication of the results “unacceptable” and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that making a complaint to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast’s political class on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by data corrected with provisional seasonal variations (SVCs) published Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the active population on the mainland and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third trimester, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
On the other hand, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOM.
Unemployment has only been stable among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it's another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is take care of the landfills he must manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
As part of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday, for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but he has been left on probation and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached to him."
"The magistrate instructor has taken the explanations into account and released him," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
On Tuesday night, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with "trafficking influences and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for “subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person engaged in public service” and for “complicity in embezzlement of public funds”, respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s colleague, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “cover-up of social property abuse.”
Among the people who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their societies have a service to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are especially focused on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elisha has exaggerated Syria’s mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has been vilifying the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Elisha has explained his strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the US justice system for trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the crude reality of how the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee’s strategic affairs adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own forcibly detained citizens in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “let go continually” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate liberation.”
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often.”
Because, once attempts to negotiate through discrete channels have been exhausted, “silence will not solve anything,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
It announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) “will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians” (€230,000 reward).
He also notes that Elisha anticipates further hostage crises, a phenomenon that “will increase”.
The Iranians could “in the near future detain another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after 12 days, but is locked up in Iran.
The following information is being released: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being sought by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which surrounds Iran’s clandestine nuclear procurement networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
To free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that it was not so.
Elisha, he claims, has not only “been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot overturn the judicial decision," he says.
Mr Richier also wants to prove that Majid Kakavand remains under the “close” surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elisha adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisha spares no effort, using organized press releases and “leaks” in the media to make it seem that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential” role as a “mediator.”
The Americans observe this activity with some irony and verify that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media blitz" of French officials.
Why is such a “gratitude” towards Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
Next, the document deals with the reasons that have led Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The major communication effort “is aimed at validating Sarkozy’s policy of opening up towards Syria,” he said.
A policy started in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been labeled premature and undeserved."
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we thanked him."
“At least this should cause confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
From midnight, young Koreans can’t play online
The South Korean government is to pass a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to parliament to call on online gaming companies to block access to games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“A lot of kids play all night and then find it hard to study in school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, a ministerial official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games when the parents of the young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow limiting the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
FIFA World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organising countries
Amid the storm sparked by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional stronghold of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidatures have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the corruption suspension of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of his country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday by airing a documentary that has brought to light three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who have been thrown into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to republish the coup successfully dealt by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the brilliance of England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, their experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ.OOO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they manage is to give points to Russia, turned into a weighty outsider despite the gaps in his candidacy (stadions, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They are putting out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
As the world’s leading economic power and home to FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weak TV rights paid (based on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: The Evidence
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had implied that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubts.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence for this does not go well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that it is doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the MPs of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It just conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he has talked about the presidential elections, with a joking tone, in meetings of this kind.
“In the worst, or better, case, you will still spend seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, “Don’t think I don’t think what will come next.”
His assertions of the previous day do not bring him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the talk that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather, the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people in the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and at the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the Prime Minister's environment reacted immediately and cautiously.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” Raffarin said.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State Letters
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end by the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt issuing institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation in European bond markets today.
The political cost would be just as high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde endorsed the ECB’s active role in resolving the European states’ debt crisis.
He did not mean whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example increasing its program of buying state bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any more eloquent as to his intentions, only indicating that the program of purchase of State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the meeting on Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main unchanged rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds doubled last week to close to €1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, yesterday it would have bought again Irish and Portuguese securities.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased securities worth EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that the purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in course.
Although loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity to beneficial conditions with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to last for a few months today.
"I can't imagine you're going to change your program considerably."
“Otherwise, it would risk triggering new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 will occur," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchasing volume of these bonds in order for the market to remain stable,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager yesterday.
Because, if interest rates are thrown into the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government weathers the storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the gap with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging against bankruptcy risk (CRQ) contracts had soared to 263 points, sparking some stir in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the euro zone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a jar of cold water for the government.
Italian growth is projected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions could be applied after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures should be adopted," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilisation efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required from other countries,” said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would open up that would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis response mechanisms
Lagarde said: “I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.”
Although it was relative, yesterday’s relaxation in the rates of European states’ bonds has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of normalization.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's announced it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most common target of speculation today.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets.”
Aware of this gap and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing mechanisms for exiting the crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers that are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the latest developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly sets the stage.
The first issue of EFSF securities is expected to take place next month.
A U.S. official told Reuters yesterday that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the frontline countries, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path from the one followed by Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs seeking international aid before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to build confidence in a lasting way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to speed up the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
On November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that if the €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a front-line player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around €100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, currently endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A piece of advice that could undoubtedly be examined in detail in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday at noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall affects the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly in <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited for heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles.
According to the gendarmes, traffic on the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend that you do not drive except in case of necessity and the movement of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transportation in Picardy was banned.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25 percent of their flights at Roissy airport and 10 percent at Orly on Thursday because of the snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France has reached its peak, it has rained billions.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of €4 billion.
On the theoretical level, this sum will be the amount that will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, we finally have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, examined in the National Assembly’s finance committee this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two modes: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase of the tax on offices in the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate such an increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from $4 billion.
“It is necessary that the tax resources be added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will be mobilized by the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses,” we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“As soon as income is created, we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and used as needed."
The SGP estimates that it will begin receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the $4 billion pledged is not included in the credit, can spark a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on December 7.
Avengers hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandalous to the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level and envisages a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of which nation it belongs to) is made up exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except Berlusconi’s) and Gaddafi’s sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of public-knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as he is lazy (or has little eagerness) the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know what, editor of the Libération), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as the Newsweek published the week before.
Then why have the revelations of these records caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we just pretend we don’t know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can search for the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "banners".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, one could think of himself as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true ever since, being able to control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that can no longer hold its own secrets be endured?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public realm; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has done a lot to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the net, since it would be like posting it on a poster in the middle of the street.
But it’s also clear that with today’s technologies, you can’t expect to have confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a thing of science fiction and, therefore, novelism, but I imagine government agents who travel discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by memory or, at most, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph.
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, at enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the travel it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was being done in secret in the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s craps in its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the fast-start funding pledges made by developed countries have been honoured.
And the French puppets have been unveiled.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (i.e. €420 million a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was an appreciable result and was appreciated for what it really was worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what “new and additional” means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
At present, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added over three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditures of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while purporting to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and each chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find such a reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to fulfill its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France makes a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, it manages to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional", as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why were the other member states going to continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The early financing chapter is a minutiae, relatively short-term, in relation to the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could move forward the debates on stakes in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food that a child about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and one snack a day.
These model meals, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances susceptible to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“Although in virtually all cases the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about a dozen residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian fillet, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were dressed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most “nutritive” with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “pollutant cocktails” generate for the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Europe Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
