Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian ramp at the village parking lot has been put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall traffic light.
Two plants so close to each other: intent or sign-poaching?
Yesterday Gutach’s mayor answered this question clearly.
"The City Hall traffic light was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"With the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety just happens here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection area was rejected again.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when choosing the location of the traffic lights: "With the aid of a transporter loaded with particularly long wooden logs, we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic lights".
The approximately 15,000 euro-priced traffic light system itself is the "most modern on the market today", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which light up so brightly that the lights can be easily recognized by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technique of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or people with a disability cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone can safely cross the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: the traffic light for pedestrians hardly showed green, a higher-class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years Josef Winkler has been writing to himself the hardships of his childhood and youth of the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the penchant for raw violence and blunt sexuality, the tightness and lack of joy - the Carinthian poet has often described.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author, and theatrical texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at St. Peter's Square.
The theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie berauernend" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisite: a crumpled sofa, on which is allegedly copied and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance whitewashes the template with a wealth of directorial insinuations, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, submerged with their heads underwater, tacked on the wall with their evening gowns.
Involved in cellophane or bodice, they stalk on dangerously high poles through the staging, either loudly monologize or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
It is only towards the end that the over-the-top performance comes to rest a bit, and Winkler’s after-right absurd humour flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits into the dashboard of every car.
The devices that track every mile driven and report the information to the authorities are the focus of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometers driven – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax rulings.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while there is no agreement in Congress on any action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re just likely to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record miles driven by all California drivers in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, financed by the taxes paid by Americans at the dispensing pillar, is bankrupt.
But in America, it is not as much fueled as it used to be.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny at high fuel prices.
“The petrol tax is simply not sustainable,” says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is popular with urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that traffic jams and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay for distances travelled.
“This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mile-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would include 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas, who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or into the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities, however, are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently enlists 5,000 drivers for the nation’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently exploring how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical that the government could track any of their moves.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big deal,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and earnings management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
As the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, cumbersome technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to capture miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
This, according to Khan, would also make the public more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not run to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of miles driven.
But the devices tested by it are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to get involved when their speed and locations aren’t recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major mistakes have been made.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that can also pay parking fees, only have to pay insurance for kilometers driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers,” the city’s planning document states.
However, some traffic planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile isn’t just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so they too pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats up
The volunteer fire brigade handled their autumn rehearsal despite staff shortages with bravery.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feather in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
There should have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and the smoke development, but one of them could still send an emergency call.
After Hans Kammerer's first examination of the situation, two of the Wehr's respiratory guards prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, he managed to find the first person and guide them outside.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first deleting attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was conducted via an overflow hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now, three deleting attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what to do with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld Day Operations Group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President of the Landtag Guido Wolf was also able to explain in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he worked with the managing directors of the Vocational Schools as well as the District Gymnasium and the chairmen of the Parental Advisory Board on this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasized Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the Vocational School Center in the Waldstadt.
In addition, he praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important to take into account not only the family phase, but also the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more people were caring for and caring for their families.
“Without the support of employers, the resulting strain on employees can lead to termination of employment,” Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often retain the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," he said.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Stay persistent and make sure that public transport gets better," he told the address of the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For the past 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting seniors from Dieting to coffee, cake and then a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly citizens were accommodated in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as a front delimitation of the old schoolyard before the renovation to Kirchstraße is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first renovation works of the front schoolyard, a small angular wall was installed to stabilize and static relieve the more than one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt (Braunlinger Stadtbauamt), the further procedure envisages the inclusion of the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and the creation of a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation is to be carried out by professionals, which is then to be put on the table of the municipal council for deciding and defining the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the refurbishment, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be refurbished from scratch and rebuilt in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has an arch slope towards the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using schoolyard, which was done by the current fastening works.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was planned as early as 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures led to a shift.
An important word in the historic refurbishment of the school walls, which has even been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If guidelines come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught again in a well-refurbished old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now engaged in the ongoing discussions about the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir told the Stuttgart News.
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
Özdemir, who is considered a favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the federal election on September 22, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is forcing a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim, among other things.
U.S. border: ‘super tunnel’ to drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
The more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they could dig themselves under the radar," Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy told a news conference outside a San Diego warehouse where the tunnel had been discovered to end.
Duffy told the drug gangs: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex design of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the confiscated marijuana.
All three face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the press conference in San Diego said.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts rather than through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug hunt DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were announced about the detainees, at least one was Mexican, it said.
You will have to face imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 will be the year of the Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year comes to an end in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming.
Geisingen and church houses were mentioned together for the first time in 794.
In churches, a certificate was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there will be an official kick-off for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrate your return.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
Also on this festival weekend is the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle is also published.
"But it is not only intended to be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists precisely of Geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today’s Geisingen also celebrates 2014’s birthday, in 1974 the present spaceship was completed with the ensembles.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is another year with many anniversaries.
The Fool’s Day Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a customary evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has on 29 March the festive banquet and then celebrates from 1 to 4 May the district music festival.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen turns 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a deed of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was produced in churches (houses), which was then a courthouse.
Accordingly, both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year anniversary in 2014 is also 40 years ago.
Council takes aim at railways
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros for it.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute with a third of the costs, the rest are shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's urban builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bahübergang "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railway track.
Larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, could also stand there in reverse traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the city council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp with his statement brought the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The rail crossing "Deer" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is to be expected that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen"" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have them investigate the costs of the planned widening of the road.
Notwithstanding this, a majority of approval was given to the rebuilding of the railway crossing, with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall would be built in such a way that the city would be able to expand the subsequent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstraße" to around 5.5 meters for meeting traffic if necessary.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Trautwein tannery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the steeply rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the railway conversion plans examined by the Breinlinger engineering office, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then still be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
The responsibility for this is again borne by the city as a road load carrier.
Accordingly, the conversion may result in liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending worked in the current state of development, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, argued Haas.
Also at this point the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because directly next to it is the stopping point center, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that there was no danger of a collision.
The majority of the councils refused approval for the conversion of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "bathe out" the problem with standing vehicles, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The committee considers the conversions at the railway junctions "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which intersection agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on big space missions: missions for billions
Faraway planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years.
Thirty proposals were available, five are still in the race.
distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life at least on some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or hunting for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their program "Cosmic Vision" they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-Missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now been narrowed down.
Numerous committees are reviewing the proposals, following up with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Program Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the ESA to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the Cheops Space Telescope is set to launch in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our surroundings will be investigated in more detail.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately to reveal the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emitted from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated as an example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa is the first of the three L-Missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer spacecraft is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and investigates the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter common to us, consisting of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are.
With "Euclid" the ESA has already approved an M-mission, the launch of which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time across the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chances of obtaining a permit as an L-Mission has "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisions a detector consisting of two or three probes, which will be stationed in space.
It could also detect gravitational waves that arose during the Big Bang, and thus provide new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes among others, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to be found on Earth, among others.
Suggestions have already been eliminated for, among other things, the transport of samples back from Mars, the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as solar physics.
Snowden ready to ‘cooperate’ with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented by Ströbele to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a deviating opinion as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize political expression with penalties in which no defense is possible.”
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment filed by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by claims that the NSA has eavesdropped on Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be seized to hear Snowden as a witness if this is possible “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said he would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden.
If Snowden says in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there, according to the MEP.
Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his homeland.
However, he is touched by the worldwide reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved.”
Frontier Airlines charges baggage charges
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 of passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, although the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers may keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small pockets under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travelers to take care of payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate this amount,” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much in their hand luggage as possible, with the result that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who would have clearly expressed that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be able to take one piece of baggage free of charge at the gate of Frontier, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a similar piece of baggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so passengers would be informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee will only come into effect in the summer, but there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting the baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, so far leave their fingers off fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge baggage charges three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is following the additional fees closely.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee grosses $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the most smooth I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and gritty discussions at the gate.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and boarding ran like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the whole can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly attempted to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had retracted.
Frontiers’ step of charging hand luggage fees if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at directing customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of using an online travel agency.
The frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party will therefore only earn customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get Frontier’s finances under control as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
Approximately 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Speakings from the Middle Ages".
After breakfast, Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the church council, gave a lecture on the Bible proverbs.
"Proverbs contain life-wisdoms, regulations, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as, “Let the wooden eye be vigilant, as scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone whom the Lord gives to His in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.”
Several times the speaker also had her listeners advise what the saying was.
The church community member Christel Dehner took up the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, make blue, make something shattered.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called “bridges into the past.”
In the end, a tombola was awarded.
The prizes were covered on a table and were described humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round also mixed mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unlearned people in tourism
On the Mecklenburg Lake District, a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already unlearned in the industry will be qualified to become specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses will end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are also involved in the project.
NSA says “internal error” and not hackers are to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had crippled its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that some users still do not.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in danger, according to the spokesperson.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency, is now in the limelight of the public eye and faces sharp criticism after the revelations made in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data released by the disillusioned former NSA employee and Snow.
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without a job fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy manager of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
So far, many companies have reacted to settings.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in the crafts, in the health care and in the care of the elderly".
As a result of the seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been available since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report on this can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt dated 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier lost profits after decline in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use under the ambitious schedule next September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago so far followed only three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts, leading to a price plunge of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday in view of the stock having limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker aircraft delivery figures were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector,” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But binding orders for the CSeries have so far been moderate at 177, as potential buyers want to wait for flight test results and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet airliner are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the company’s management also assured analysts and media that the program was on schedule.
“The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s lifetime.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then add a revision period, which we did as well.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the commissioning planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progression of the flight test – even if they are obviously consistent with Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
Adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace segment fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railroad manufacturer, announced that revenue in this segment has risen by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30, slightly increasing compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to the company management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In late Thursday trading, the Bombardier stock declined 8.5 percent to $4.83 after it was also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is being informed about the situation on an ongoing basis, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried and children would have cried.
Among those waiting, panic broke out, many hiding behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
Afterwards, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The gunshots are believed to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
Airport building evacuated
Television footage showed numerous ambulances and police cars driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were rescued from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a Special Operations Command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
Access roads were closed, resulting in long backlogs, according to CNN.
Until landings, air traffic was temporarily halted, it said.
However, several planes were also observed on CNN at launch.
Terminal 3 is primarily served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss about police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information with Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool’s Crown Court.
A well-known criminal lawyer who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police oversaw Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 worth of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was convicted and convicted at Liverpool’s Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of impediment to justice.
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs under the lawyer’s trash can with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It became known in court that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but declined to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming their discussion was subject to “lawyer secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
At the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office at both his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had called important actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender for overly engaging with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were unquestionably legitimate, for he was the advocate of these persons.
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal lawyer to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial impairment, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals, showing that no one can evade the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted a question-and-answer section about himself stating that his dream job was to represent death cell clients in America, his ultimate dinner guest was Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the song wreath Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10:15 at the service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Sacred Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass will be performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: scepticism steadily departs confidence
With the 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, fundamental changes will take place in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The fundamental decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: skepticism about the new one is hesitant but increasingly departing from confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees held extremely constructive discussions with the main officers of the pastoral team.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drafted guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Thereafter, the SE Haslach as a church community will in future form a public body, which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council, in which the pastor Kraft Amtes is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and local community teams are to be formed in the six parishes.
In the future, their task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the village.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes are retained for the purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then hit all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Bruno Prinzbach, chairman of the parish council.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chair of the body in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made it their mission in 2006 to “become one, stay five” and had to realize that it wasn’t that easy at all.
The committees of the Haslacher Seelsorgeeinheit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be made concrete in further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is getting more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family will be charged 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5,277 cents to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These figure out the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can levy through a surcharge on the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed in its forecasts of a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect a 1 cent plus x increase," says Bias, with the number more likely to be close to 2 cents.
Traffic lights on permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do - drive in red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to hold on for at least five minutes before assuming a malfunction of the traffic light.
Anyone who continues the journey despite the red light, however, must be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused by it.
If you tolerate less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the case under negotiation, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous redness and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but sprang a little later on to green.
A driving ban was spared because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
City Council welcomes solid budget
When it comes to the budget at city council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debt since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget, at around 7.6 million euros, was one million euros higher than planned.
The administrative budget surplus of around 1.8 million euros is also about one million euros above the approach.
It is mainly due to the surplus of higher business tax revenues and the community’s share of income tax.
The wealth budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," Rothmund said.
As fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the reserve inflow was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the council were very pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but exactly these good numbers could soon come to be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to avoid high lifts in the past.
In turn, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have already been cut more often.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensating stocks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must show certain lifts.
"We have to look at the topic of lifting, because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the Cäcilia Men’s Association is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest, in the framework of which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was, as usual, on stage in the colours of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir, which is now more than loved.
Wermter was also active in the association, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
For his commitment and his loyalty to the association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the tribute, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual tracks: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers’ department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They prepared a small stand for their honored singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The Betra Männergesangsverein also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "Wenn du durchstehst durch das Tal".
The song wreath Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulsor" - provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folk manner "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer opened a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy during lunchtime.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive post these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwald Bote would like to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and day-care centres from all over the Zollernalbkreis can take part in the campaign.
If you have a desire for construction or beautification for your facility, you can apply with this at the Schwarzwald Boten.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwald Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three requests from all submissions.
What are the requirements for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner must provide himself for many diligent construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
With the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb, Bauhaus makes the material available.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Outrages Over Controversial Media Law
“We are in a frightening situation and you may ask yourself: what is it that prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is effectively embezzling the media through the new law, while The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya reportedly suffered a "serious blow" and labelled the draft as "draconic".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities for posting footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can face a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can face up to one million plus the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "lively blogosphere" description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do with impunity whatever they want.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, who calls the Kenyan media a critical control factor in public life.
“Leaving politicians to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have been in public trouble in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reintroduced their heavy salaries of about 532,000 Schillings per month tax-free – some of the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field did not lose anything on the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had hoped for a more pleasant time last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for some reason had the insufficiency.
This was true of the musicians who framed the act, as well as so many speakers.
This is why FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker became Nass, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks went first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, to the City Council, the companies involved and the members of the association who contributed.
Here in particular Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The ardent retirees laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
Karl Rombach, Member of Parliament, also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings spoke for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Fifteen years ago, the first considerations were to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the real school on Lake Salina was thought.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about setting up an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in inheritance lease, promised a cost contribution of 100,000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros of the total cost of 560,000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial grass square began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of soil were removed, half of which was used for the laying of a dirt bike track.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about the topic of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive", said the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasive traffic on country roads, which were already the focal points of accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
“There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date,” he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage

Drivers seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old woman from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath at around 21.15.
When the road wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, it overlooked the incoming car of the 37-year-old.
The driver's eye collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout on the Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left turn-off in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constanceer driving there.
A 19-year-old VW Passat behind the BMW was also damaged.
In total, about 15,000 property damage occurred, the police said.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it was said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are thus eliminated - the noise level is to be significantly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refraining from the noisy calls.
By eliminating these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls from the speakers will sound in one day - it will be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time also all other information about changed flight stops or departure times here go down a bit," Kleemann told the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake wagon pulling with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander games start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are breathed Swabian on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It doesn’t matter how far it is,” explains organiser Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown down vertically, should overlap once and then come straight to the bed.
This is rated with most of the points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From a distance of eight meters, it is thrown on a stake.
Participants must demonstrate skill and strength when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a pond are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
Appropriate clothing is desirable, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scottish skirt.
But also Swabian costumes are allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music lovers will get their money’s worth.
At 7 p.m. the birabohemian brass music from Schömberg organizes the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes emotional waltzes and a rich big-band sound.
Heinz Koch, well-known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be there.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Fool's Donuts.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early stalling, from 2 pm the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The start of the stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf is already on Friday.
Other program items include the classic car and tow truck meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize maze, the craftsman’s market and the sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw hop castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Multipurposehalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkapsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quark substitute.
The Vegetarian Confederation also calls for World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Floatable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Even 50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Black Forest high school students met the American city of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we headed for the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here, a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered, which makes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then we went through the financial center around Wall Street to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the Empire State Building’s 373-metre-high viewing platform while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, we went through the hectic hustle and bustle of New York’s streets via the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short lingering in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing the day-to-day school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the day of the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to the legend, St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter who converted by a vision and was later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blowers group of the Hunting Tribes Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth performs on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear equestrian clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog mobs on tow hunts musically.
The solemn Mass takes place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the lexicon, déj<0xC3><0xA0> vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of visiting the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district city of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to stay with the pure déj<0xC3><0xA0> vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but always repetitive.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A glimpse into the interior of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the outset.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the head spoils the guest with a wide variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually covered fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the elegant café at Opschlag: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least by the university.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the espresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better say one.
Because the port festival took place rather outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe that’s why Daniel Büttner isn’t a fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it right for everyone.”
And with an event, I always only speak to those who are also interested in the special event.
That’s why events will be the exception with us.
“We want to disrupt normal operation as little as possible.”
Let’s say: Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve.
The street that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the right festivity to perform honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also made so many rounds for us, for that our heartfelt thanks," said Erich Schlotmann, chairman of the choir.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was awarded to the musician Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of club manager Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club's venue.
“We are always welcome to hear new voices that are happy to sing,” says Schlotmann.
UN Announces New Poverty Reduction Targets
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty alleviation announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world political leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to reach agreement on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my best to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball upper league.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts about this.
Everyone is fully motivated on the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know what such a victory tastes like anymore," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn down trees, Malmon raises in advance warning the index finger.
I have trained a lot of players in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"We also have to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
Above all, in the cover work and in the changeover game, it last had a great deal of luck.
The use of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally got their heads clear during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Independence Square of the capital.
For the past two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, backed initially by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring more than $50 billion in investment from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos spokesperson told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to French news agency AFP, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “loser” who wants to “use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who hit their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a crippling movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up his presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out unrest-provoking attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south link.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded with restraint to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“Renamo and Frelimo aren’t interested, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with authors and teachers who were "excessively didactic" children would "completely shut down", because in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed "subliminally".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tale, explained: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were brought to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returned to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then the game of scenery began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his paraderol as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he advanced with the two-spanner and "black forest foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood incredibly well to get into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
In order to confer the honorary citizenship, Haslach’s mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honor, who, on behalf of the then incumbent Hattich, together with a part of the city council, made his attendance.
Afterwards, the three-king singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh how beautiful, there come to life again youth memories of my own three-king times".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the upheavals in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home earth, behind his burial chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever," the scene said at the end of the game.
There was a lot of applause and praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants grows
The chances of remaining in the league of the sportingly declining Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar Riesen.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers is refraining from applying for a possible second place.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
A first breath of relief was not yet to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told the newspaper.
Up until May 23rd, Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Abendmahlskirche gets into the spotlight
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s culture and tourism office is dedicating the last of this year’s public themed tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Communion Church.
After the visit of the Atomkeller-Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The culminating point is a visit to the Communion Church.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, in the church there is also the view of the evening meal painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
Maps are available at the counter of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the City of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia in person.
This was reported to the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such an issue could be clarified interstately, it said.
An exit of Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
“In this case, he loses his refugee status,” the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden is threatening extradition there.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the title in the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were on par with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
In second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze stage.
With late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or gyro’s, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required.
For all young detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 2 p.m.
On a railing tour, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who runs his scavenger's club with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is cosy and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 pm.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, on both event days from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the broombinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can look over their shoulders in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum await a varied holiday program.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable Kauz because he decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt is not distracting from his dream.
With his savings, a pair of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships on the shelf.
The company has several irons in the fire at the same time.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the charcoal in the storage space in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dump and return loaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the handling equipment moves, there is a crisp warning sound over the terrain.
"The signals are for security purposes and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is widely heard in the case of unfavourable winds - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city council.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, we will continue to engage in open dialogue with our neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the deepened 18.5 meters deck in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here for a long time.
"This year, we want to crack the 3 million tons mark in the handling," Schrell said.
In addition to the on-site Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to inland power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern’s basketball player is optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism with the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night with defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We have sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
With their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to convert a 15-point lag 13 minutes before the end into a lead, before Piraeus gave the game a turnaround again.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were Munich’s most successful throwers, who had victories in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish champion Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Just under a hundred years ago, Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling jokes directly to the crowd in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation was expanded, as was the case most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too familiar to perform at a club at some point,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me, when he's here, sometimes he walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiation Process
One week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers, Iran is satisfied with the negotiating process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Comrades with Machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old man in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird-hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s reported on Thursday.
They then played football in front of their homes in a working class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the youngster they had taken with them was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the procession before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder mentioned, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a youth psychiatric institution.
Pimps must go to jail
Constance County Court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison for exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threatening, insulting and dangerous bodily harm.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
According to him, in five cases he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the bottom after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the revenues of the women, who partly acquired for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he interrupted women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the mental limitation and thus a limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after an initial notification by telephone surveillance measures.
The interviews were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is a “completely broken personality” who sees violence and exploitation as normal in this field.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He has detached himself from these circles and wants to live a normal life after his arrest,” he said.
Oil price continues to rise to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns over high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The December reference crude oil for deliveries in Europe fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel late in the morning in e-commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocks NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Policy Decision
A U.S. federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge’s order calling for changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program, and released the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until the city’s appeal was decided.
The judge ruled in August that the city was violating the constitution with the way in which the program for stopping and interrogating people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its policy and training program.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeals report stated that the judge must be released from the case for violating the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality, partly on the basis of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service oversight, and ordered a pilot program of body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing on the city’s appeal is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have existed for decades in various forms, but the number of checks recorded during the term of nonpartisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities filed a lawsuit, which turned into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police presidencies use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also, money would be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that has been under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only manages to reach dreamy camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
In 2004, he was the first in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous surgeries on several trips.
During the speeches, images of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the aforementioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former CEO of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to act as a consultant at the association.
In 2008, the carpentry firm Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a misery district on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis - in the record time of almost a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a medical doctor, according to Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this, many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, dressing material, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to a mobile goat’s stable and describing the experiences of the native musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby’s voicemails and tracked them, but Coulson also called them and left behind news, as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecution, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He denies that, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors about Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time of the search, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson sent her a voicemail saying, “I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hack.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without result.
In the conflict over the wealthy tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives of associations and associations in the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on incomes of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The scheduled playoffs in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between 29 November and 2 December are therefore cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to get an explanation of the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häussler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häussler.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The goal is to protect as many built-up land as possible," says Häussler.
The basis is the planning of protection against a flood that is statistically expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is met by a 15% surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aClimate".
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve relative improvement,” says Häussler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aClimate protection, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to count on state subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häussler pointed out, however, that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in sum.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Anger prevailed among the residents of the Altort, who suffer from overload of the canal network, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häussler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three-year rainfall events can be handled.
Sizing the sewage ducts larger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman being so severely jammed that it took the fire brigade barely half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both victims arrived in nearby hospitals.
The track was closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly the kinship on the outside: the prickly eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, is to be understood, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is certainly considered something in his own country.
Some titles have been published in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes Zweitausendeins.
Dick explains America – the realm of breathtaking technical progress coupled with paranoia, security delusion and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John’s Revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood early on that calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the scent of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's terrifying world, mutants are looking into the future - and the police are coming.
"We are tracking individuals who have not violated any law," the head of the agency said.
"We'll grab them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a penal camp full of pesudo criminals." You read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s narrative acts as the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terrorism laws and eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: That’s how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is supervised and convicted of a future crime.
The system is rotating.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Don’t just buy mistakes and sacrifices, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick’s reading is about getting closer to the truth.
Merkel's Speech Affair in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. military affair surrounding Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in Russia in person, the agency Interfax reported.
Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations intensify company paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the United States did not use foreign espionage “to steal the secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could enhance their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, a former whistleblower, began publishing his fill horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have pushed the company’s paranoia to a new high because of state surveillance.
The barrel to the overflow led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been swaying, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management is certainly also a potential target.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. has now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was no evidence to date that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“That’s not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
A big change is taking place in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the USA is subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy managing director, said: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this legal space?”
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been an issue for many years and the current discussion has not fundamentally changed,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick to a trade show or leaving a laptop unguarded in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BBT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
In February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia and Israel second behind China, according to the Washington Post.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it came to economic espionage, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies.”
Hechingen: Mass Gives Answer to Wedding Questions
“Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake,” said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony succeeded, now a special fair was held in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: the retro look has come back.
It starts with wedding dresses.
White is must-have, best covered or in cream.
The often ruffled and embroidered dresses are closed at the front, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end in a tow.
However, the ghosts part, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the Modehaus Kleidermüller.
For men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The selection of the venue is important, it was explained.
Jewelless adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
Whoever wants to ride with the carriage then, for him, Uwe Link has an offer.
"But carriages are also popular for bachelorette farewells," he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding-photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cake and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
Again, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to 12th place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp and her Woody faced the judge’s critical glances in class 1.
Parents of Georgia teen who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled up wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 in an upright mat standing behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium.
Investigators for the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this questioned the 17-year-old’s family.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s attorney, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it lacks any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, let them be convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to learn and came back in a corpse bag,” he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death attributable to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested Johnson had died as a result of “positional suffocation.”
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that authorities must release all surveillance videos that investigators have verified.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the videotapes contained clues as to how he died.
CDC Publishes Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with children’s food allergies in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to be able to deal with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states recently changed the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of intersex children may choose ‘gender indefinite’
Germany is the first European nation to have a third gender recognized for children born with unclear genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can state "indefinite" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to remove pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgeries for sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I am neither man nor woman.”
I remain the patchwork that was created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children is born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to intersex, a group diagnosed as “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germs (egg or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise using the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – on surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can make a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission stated that intersex people should be distinguished from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but is due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were manifested in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australia’s Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court granted lifelong retention of an “undefined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
Catholic Online said: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would be better off if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Being a parent is stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency,’” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with unclear genitalia comes from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was formable.
He coined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental impulses—how parents raise a child—interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person viewed himself as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a foul circumcision to completely neuter the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual surgeries came to the public who are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were unclear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized when I was born, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation he became infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatizing”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign the child an ‘unspecified’,” she said.
We fear that this will benefit interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know what the law will do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to be recognized as the third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she explained.
German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children into at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law “enforces” both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the prescription effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents room, so they don’t have to rush to make decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to take various tests and clarify things, thus giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to overhaste an operation that can't be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents expel because they think they are not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides which gender best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown Injures Girl by Shot From Car
Unknowns injured a 12-year-old girl in a car shooting in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had fired a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin, probably with an air pressure weapon.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured in the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The police investigated, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues immediately, no property damage should have occurred either.
In addition, some New Year’s Eve bulls were probably set on fire in the city area, but no damage to property has occurred here.
A resident on the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man has found his cycling screens all in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a Future Perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider at the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for me and my husband for some time now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty has had to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently a book of hers has been published on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age," she begins to tell.
When she moved to the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, in his mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who is even dealing with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most people push it out as long as they can.
They always get old just the others,” she says, smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, do you think about it.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
"Whatever form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who could afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, one is also united in Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives to emigrants to consider.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age everyone has their ticks and ticks
"For me, this would be a residential community, but nothing," she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
“In old age, you just need your retreat rooms,” says Ries.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior housing community can still function.
However, this would have to be different than in the classic student flat.
And sometimes you just want your peace of mind, she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, it is not there alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as they can in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service Life in the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people around the topic of 'becoming older'.
That is why especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate reconstruction of their house or apartment to first inform themselves thoroughly and not to hire the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment age-appropriate and thus barrier-free, even if it is still beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she scares more than before the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants Snowden to continue to prosecute
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He continues to be accused of unauthorized disclosure of secret information.
He must therefore face criminal proceedings in the United States, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent remarks would not change that.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to no longer threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele’s remarks were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Secret service whistleblower Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the US in an unaddressed letter that Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, Bundestag and Attorney General.
After a translation circulated by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the competent
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be a contractor or a direct technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which prompted me to act out of a moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was subjected to a severe and ongoing incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations of an all-encompassing surveillance system that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government still treats dissent as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalize and indict political opinion.
To tell the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will remove this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
At its most recent meeting in the non-public part, the council approved the sale.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
The budget was set at €100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is happy.
Square concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann raises the clockstick at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich’s musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician’s chock.
Report: Obama Campaign Considered Replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The reveal is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long-awaited work about the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “large group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out whether Obama’s dwindling hope of re-election would be better off if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times’ national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by campaign and White House leaders, including former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the poll values of swapping former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, Obama’s former campaign leader, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew about the planned change.
“Double Down” claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite his “close, personal relationship” before finally opting out of such a move, after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy would “not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I’ve said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll values at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigation as “committed care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
“Campaigns don’t spend as much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t seriously think about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
While Daley said he did not believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing of the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
What happens on the way to my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the letter secret technically implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to that of the conventional post?
When designing early internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been careful to provide a stable foundation for a hearing-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a traditional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two connected directly?
In the first step, Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of its service provider.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can run through a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will traditional emails be read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read several times by software robots on the way.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display corresponding links to holiday deals.
Do unknown people read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
In theory, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal opportunities to intercept or take notice of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal surveillance activities.
Is it possible to protect emails from being read?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that even who has communicated with whom cannot be easily recognized.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
According to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had recently fallen, Google’s GMail was able to grow significantly.
Mother hides in the forest and collects pension
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest – and continued to collect their pension and care.
In order to be able to collect further pension and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after investigations by the police.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he took the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: at that time it was noticed that no medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials felt this was strange, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to the police.
Want ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice cream in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after reading a paper on jellyfish and persuading Chinese scientists to make the luminous protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in and of itself impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I guess we find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially made by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball League after six match days.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers, the derby against TSV Daverden, which celebrated its first victory last weekend, will take place tomorrow.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads cleared," Ehlers is behaving optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, also relies on tempo play.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has recently left anything but a certain impression.
Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re still far from the favorite, because in the derby, anything can happen.
Still, Panitz now wants to play in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I became more of a Halloween moustache.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I am not going to do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the US Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, irritating inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
When it comes to men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone with this to my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
They are a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we're not circusy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who walk through the neighborhoods with the saying “Sweet or Sour”.
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not mess with it – eat it.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion grains of corn.
It’s a mystery that I haven’t been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spooks.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially-recognized ghost houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos where you just pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook where you can’t get rid of them, and then the guy you’re standing on leaves you a comment like “nice facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a young age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers pile up charred corpses
The fire department had to leave late Thursday night in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
Rescuers recover a charred body from the house.
Rescuers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, a spokesman for the Bayreuth police said.
By late Thursday night, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames already blew out of a window.
The police went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day routine yourself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a full-fledged pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-ecclesialization: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could make a good living from it.
Surely more would be paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just about careers, but about a meaningful job.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may become difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point harnesses as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as for an accessible path to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will feature a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to rescue a puppy who sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby fled after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable position.
Firefighters roped off the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to rescue a puppy who was stuck on a 15-metre-high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby fled after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby back and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the spot and roped off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall, 15 meters above and below.
She didn’t move any muscles during her rescue – she was like a stiff frostbite.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual assignment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby was very lucky.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Watching rescue was scary.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she ate dinner with the Altrocker and that “he shook me when I was 18.”
She added, “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made attempts at rapprochement with Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year’s Rolling Stones tour.
Their new album "Prism" landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along the Hadrian’s Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits that would entail more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but it did not play a role – as expected – in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would be just a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come in such a way in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why trade the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, drawn up after the war, has come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win nearly five million votes in the Bundestag election in September, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deepening European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives issued by Brussels - a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity as the United States and four times as much for gas.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage bills do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is raging, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that could keep Germany in check and raise Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, with which the struggling French economy has to struggle.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-opposing Front National has just won a decisive by-election, thus pointing the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a right-wing split would automatically bring benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among working-class white French?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last analysis) small-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a looser European alliance, if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and keeping our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against austerity policies in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to blame.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to get an austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts Believe Epidemic Obesity Is a Trigger of Early Puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that’s not an indication that puberty is fast coming,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axle hair, as well as body odor, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the appearance of the first menstrual bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years until the menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt aged eight years.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progression, tests by an endocrinologist could be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, developmental speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant when it comes to medication, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being unlike their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her days at the age of ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, linking body fat to entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and puberty hair grows earlier, the trend towards full earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month’s Dubai Airshow.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch-rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21 November record orders are expected.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results, which the new "Mini-Jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" can hold 406 people at tourist-class seats that are over 17 inches wide, thus allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share blows about technical details through advertising in the trade press.
Airbus is now appealing to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed funders a picture of three people squeezed together in a restaurant and the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props,” says Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
Faced with changed eating habits, people get thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out that showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ seat measurement figures and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance airfare and facility.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us dictating to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the clash is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat on their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements about the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with currently used ten-seat machines per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive for our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat from the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin furnishing expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape size to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they praise comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density jets for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a 10-seater A350, but has not yet sold one.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to evaporate, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Shut Down Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More trials are needed before testing in humans, which can take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit trying all the methods available on the market but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain genetic information about the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, took a “break,” the researchers said, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is quite certain, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use it to quit.
“Then you know, when you start smoking again, you don’t feel any pleasure about it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps you get rid of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi Denies Being Influenced by Obeid
An investigation into former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is underway by the state corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime leasing regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert interests in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiration in August 2005.
Tripodi was aware of Obeid's covert interest in the property after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned Obeids $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally called for public tenders.
But he declined to make the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a redesign of the government’s lease arrangements.
An ICAC telephone transcript showed August-September 2007 talks between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial leasing arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can’t remember what was being discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to ‘authenticity test’
The government is considering an "authenticity test" for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be used via a criterion that would prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was released after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia’s neighbors.
“Noiseful statements such as ‘foreigners to stand behind’ and ‘Australians to stand first’ are a very unpleasant relapse at a time when trade unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region perceived an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka for talks on human trafficking yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, the person applying for a visa could be checked to determine whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker is believed to have died from a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week on a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia is cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railroad project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our target for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to “unequivocally” advocate for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, Scotland’s economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That’s why we’re delighted to be working as a partner to the UK government and exploring the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigative report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices on aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, watch, or play e-books during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode.”
Passengers are already allowed to do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision that U.S. airlines will have to do a lot of work to implement, but are not pursuing direct plans to change their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
“Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it said.
The topic is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and that passengers follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying it is open to changes, but they need to be initiated by lawmakers.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will stay with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current policies provide that electronic devices may not be used during take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and modify manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases with poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB supporters had travelled with lighted rockets for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost spooky acoustic, which offered the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quiet: No songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the grandstand a large flag with the inscription "Section Prohibition Stadium" blew solo.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the place as always as the first BVB player, short-term cheers burned up.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but far from everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune, nothing moved.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again mentioned the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the kick-off, the Capo climbed its pedestal - and the tension that had hitherto been palpable with hands escaped in a loud scream, as dickling as usual questioned the mood on the stands in the stadium.
As always, it was the turn of the South Tribune - and at last, as usual, it was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call "derby winner stands up" came from the South Tribune, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters who had travelled with them had fired light-emitting missiles into the spectators' ranks and onto the court - and almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller had met.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the top of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade that,” he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"It's going to be insane," Watzke assured.
One can’t wait to see what the reactions on the South Tribune will be like.
Pawnshops boom in Singapore as crisis has arrived in middle class
In a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) a month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is increasing — is so great that ValueMax, where it traded, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Placing jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Singapore pawnshops demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent demanded by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that there is no need for credit checks or income proofs, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
This is why millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose financial policies in developed economies, lower- and middle-income families are looking for pawnshops to make up for the difference in the tumbling economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product, according to the agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have further intensified the trend of pledging personal items as people seize the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city state’s 200 pawnshops are gold.
People are saying, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the lien business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only bid lower interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“Customers lend items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase budgetary training,” she explains.
The leasing business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use liens are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax stores to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all social strata come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who are short-term lending for a business or investment, or small businesses that need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Secret Service whistleblower Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany uncover the increasingly explosive NSA space affair.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, the question was under what conditions the ex-intelligence officer would testify to a German prosecutor’s office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
325 Million Australian Dollars Rescue Package for Tasmanian Healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $325 million Australian health care bailout package to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “immediate action” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The four-year funding was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Mr. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency election assistance.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic procedures and treatments for grey star, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare for inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff told me were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “it is not accompanied by real reforms that will put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election services will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the view that today’s announcement is just a “plaster solution.”
“We are in today’s situation because the lab state government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier food than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, the story tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another’s erotic fascination.
The film never slips away in lust or sensational lust – and that is its problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and GVG facilities, the global chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday, as clashes broke out in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization had set up Damascus to destroy or render “inoperable” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all of Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to be 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting underscores the danger to which the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, as their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, "there are currently no further inspection activities planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been abandoned, according to Syrian statement, "and the chemical weapons program objects there had been relocated to other named facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat off of the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the director-general of the monitoring organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting this civil war against Assad’s government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, a secession of Shiite Islam.
Rami Abdurrahman, the head of the monitoring group, said Wednesday there was a heavy explosion at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
Anger over sentencing for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded with anger at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be tried because they believed Umar Patek should be shot legally.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A conviction was also made in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also referred to as the “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a firing squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was grounded when a huge bomb exploded in a minivan parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on a life-sustaining system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually taken in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the tenth anniversary of this year’s attack, which is celebrated with memorials in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but not make phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music, and watch movies from flight to land, but not phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline, FAA staffer Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight personnel training manuals as well as the regulations for the storage of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You may not start it again until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing, passengers must turn it off again and must not start it again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even during take-off, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been retrofitted to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented securely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit,” Glading said.
We are honestly tired of having to feel like a watchman on this issue.
Nevertheless, internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometers remained prohibited, the agency explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not “Words With Friends,” the Scrabble-like online game actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he publicly had to leave an American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops still need to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is the regulator of telephone calls, not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission poles,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is mentioned that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
In 1966, the FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers after reports of disruption of navigation and communication devices by passenger-carrying FM radios became known, which at that time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suited for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when flipping.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Advocates of easing restrictions on passenger use include Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the device disruption is genuine, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only occasional reports of pilots talking about disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices by the passengers in the event of a landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable fit for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a comfortable passenger experience does not conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
North Sea Drilling Rink Rescued Bird Released by Air Rescue Service
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling rig, was released back into nature.
The water runway was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was packed up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water runway was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: “He could no longer fly further, which is why we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water rail was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, roughly representing UK company sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favor new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than stopping the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked about certain legal issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the single market, as the companies said the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the one that has traditionally been the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wanted Britain to take a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of mind in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy stands behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, what means for companies a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller calls Bulgarian pipeline the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, is concerned with an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes live in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed out this at the 9th real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The search for German commercial properties shows the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, while in France it was 19%.
“Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates,” Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged on charges against Jonathan Lord for sex offenses
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child-related sex offenses before charges were filed against child caregiver Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that “the organization has never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offenses, and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted in 1991 of abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the commission’s assistant attorneys, knew about the first case, but didn’t know about the second one.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the allegation that “there were external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognized as a front-runner in child safety.”
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest assessment of four possible in a Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) quality audit in August of the year.
Hare, who started at 21 at the YMCA, admitted that management had “failed downward from me” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees had been clear about their obligations to report child safety violations.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexual misconduct against twelve boys during his two-year YMCA service.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s child safety violations.
Employees said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, taking care of them privately as babysitters, letting them sit on his lap, telling one that he loves them, and letting children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the childcare supervisor Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable".
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their supervisors.
Instead, he said, had rather impaired their friendship with Lord’s judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW of his view that the lesson the organization had to learn from the "Jonathan Lord incident" "does not concern the reporting" by employees, and the board of directors had agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA’s Children’s Services Director Liam Whitley.
He said this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this was “overzealous” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" with the recruitment, review, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance of a return as British prime minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, mostly confining his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Middle East Peacemakers Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by London’s Evening Standard as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that there was a tough competition ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and has only taken his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee ran loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally tall, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has since practiced every day with the Shetland pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the field with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone cheered and clapped on him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee by how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes have contributed their part, which really fit the occasion perfectly.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after call
A Chinese newspaper that had called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on its front page should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted bribes to fake reports about a sub-state company.
Now the New Express is undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The "rectification order" was issued by the Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that New Express, which is part of Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it was decided to “impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to deprive him of his reporter’s license.”
Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and immediately review the management team of the New Express.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain public trust,” he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I acted wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that barred authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel found with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The zigzag tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, authorities said.
The discovery of the tunnel had secured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the records of the court.
Three men who worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences ranging from ten years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, challenging drug cartels to get their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passageway with rails running from a kitchen in a Tijuana residential building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air on Friday, Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or hope.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
“We will support and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is quite different from it.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream pie, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these delicacies are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan abstains from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but on closer examination, the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Around the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday concerns can also be done without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” says Proctor, the vegan maxim that extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirring eggs or gum bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a renunciation, it's an asceticism, it's an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options with dietary change, Proctor is more likely to attribute to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some attempts, however well-intentioned, fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And he says, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the beast."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplant, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty once.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but that's not just to reduce to animal food," Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not take foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I get checked often," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegan critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content of the meat purchased in the refrigerator is high," says Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 levels are fine,” he explains.
Proctor doesn't have to go a long way in food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need is on site.
Every now and then I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is known to be the case with "ordinary" finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time consuming than commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partially, better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to make his in-laws amazed.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
That’s dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new place.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions one has to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
“I don’t reject people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor doesn’t want to be an enclave.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not appear as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pomegranates are everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he diverts to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
Restaurants are slowly adjusting to this.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
In fact, vegan food is for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a surefire way to make the vast majority of it impossible from the start,” says Proctor.
Purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as a coloring agent, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried - food but also cleaning agents.
“Sometimes it’s better to take small steps than to stop or stumble,” says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral pointer that strikes on consciousness.
Maybe he doesn’t quite manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns with the stock exchange operator.
On Tuesday, Nasdaq’s indices were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
First, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, it took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading came to a halt due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
Last year, Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later ruled on the stock exchange and gave the company a record $10 million fine.
Constance: Radler drives around 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident happened when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a women's bike was illegally on the left sidewalk from the station square towards the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist could not brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and suffered a 15-centimeter-long place wound on the head.
An ambulance team took the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today handed an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been given an "invitation to face up" requesting him to appear at a police station, adding that if he fails to comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden over the charge of a sex offense after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had “provided a 40-year-old man with an invitation to stand at a police station at a time we chose,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited by Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage allegations after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the revelation website WikiLeaks.
A driver who was hit between his legs at 210 km/h and a hot drink gets a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty was imposed on a driver for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 casualty surcharge.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Treasury George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp tax on apartments that cost over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceed the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, it is hard to say that high-quality properties are taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more restrained when it comes to buying real estate in London, or stop owners from selling it,” he added.
Top-notch real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s wealthy southwestern belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog’s tail swollen and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tails swung more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right brains respond differently to stimuli that elicit positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail swings of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said, “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to use it to steer the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved its tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the whirling dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tilt was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the waving with the tail is linked in a direction rather to friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, it was stated: “Dogs are more likely to go to a robotic dog when its ‘tail’ wiggles to the left and not to the right, rather than to become restless – exactly the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined - and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
But since their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer became ill with laryngeal inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play at Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert must now be moved.
The band's announcement came after it had to postpone an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation, which is why he unfortunately cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which has been moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointing new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 “voting cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, would be held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals will again be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year is important because it is the first since Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a certain overhang in Europe and in particular in Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He declared that it was “well possible” that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that bishops from large places would typically be called cardinals, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat back
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a U.S. vehicle safety regulator statement on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat back.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety for head restraints.
“When driven from the rear onto the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest may not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website said in a statement.
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the letter of notification due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse the Obamacare website problems, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient caps in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and take a breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news spokespersons stopped to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening as if torn from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the partisan blockade tactics have overturned too many aspirations to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to an end with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to intercept foreign heads of state or kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers who disclose state misconduct are being punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP’s office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre are shaping the public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I elected Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unyielding alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard so long ago.
But with the fall in Obama’s approval ratings to below 45% this week, the book’s return to 2008 has become even harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have been dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to make a serious loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with election officials after the decision, he told his staff that they must come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire and congressman Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mountain agnat, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim as he wanted to wipe questions off the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important in deciding whether to remove or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to make it happen faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you walk in, enter data into a computer, dial in immediately, and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Voting with pencils nowadays is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy would include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about service to the public.
“We seek no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, including two people familiar with the situation, and this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is speeding up.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is traded daily.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the escalating investigation into the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that RBS forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a previous trader to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been on leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years ago in search of cases of misconduct.
News of these investigations has stirred up traders in an area that has been among the most profitable of investment banks’ trading units in recent years, but was under pressure this year because low currency volatility restricts opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that “you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices”.
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced it had quit a trader at its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and worked with them.
“We are sure that the dealer acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle land
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle land on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned up and broadened the footpath, a press release said.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the back part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had negotiated the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent with the message "We are for it" was attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversations with many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these responses, the BI says.
As can be seen, the mayor’s public remarks have also had an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end of the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem frightened because of this, others see it as a "pumping blackmail attempt" on the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane no Swallow King
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow Kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese became an alleged acting disaster - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant wrong decision," said Rangnick, referring to referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself doesn’t want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
“Because I am the one who was offended,” the 46-year-old said.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for this: Really good," he said.
There is not much to be exposed.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's just keep it going.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player approaches with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – requiring U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the House, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, and also held the view that the health law’s requirement that states either expand Medicaid access requirements or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century-long dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland enthused at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some people in the valley moved on to sun chairs, while others put on sunglasses for safety.
Previously, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (around 615,000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian alpine town of Viganella with wintery sunshine for some years.
Post barely empties on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post office building on Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still Sunday, is not answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up here.
The Sunday emptying is an important postal service especially at the appointment post office.
“These are radically and unreasonably thinning this venture despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013.”
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals' Groups and Municipal Associations, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that emptying hours are secretly changed or even cancelled here."
The post office is miles away from the town.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also within walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration plans to talk to the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post office did not communicate with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatization.
“Then decisions are made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more expensive.
This morning, the city’s magistrate will discuss a presentation by traffic chief Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, parking fees are to be increased by 50%.
However, it is not intended to raise prices, but rather to shorten the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen.
The Adlers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
However, it soon became apparent that, even due to age, they could not fully keep up with the rapid actions of the joy cities .
With the hard and placed surcharges, the Gonningers were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the center of the net and were not present in the block defense.
Two high first set gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all matters.
In the face of this overwhelming and decisive performance, the third set was then won a bit lazy and lustless to the 3-0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, with TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly prevail in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and gifts of points, especially when taking the ball; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical game scenes, the overzealousness prevented the gaze for possible point wins.
In this performanceally very balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project in Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view of the valley should be cleared on that day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the gorges, where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time, the tourist aspect can also be taken into account ecologically.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Presidium of Freiburg following the welcome by Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had assumed the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the touristic goal of the foresight is in line with the aim of preserving the now strongly grown old Allmendweiderfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grass hops, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure not only fits seamlessly into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement of what has been achieved with the life project as well as the previous care days for the future.
After these different explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, the forest tractor is ready to be called up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was to have a clear view of the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Baar Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been nominated.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen is the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for age.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it outdone in Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offering several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After it was surpassed by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google as it claims Google’s patent infringement was intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt sworn in its first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is not expected to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which has its seat on the Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at the ceremony, broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said Morsi, 60, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been sharply targeted by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in court to cheer on the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential splendour, traffic was only briefly halted so that the car convoy could cross the usual busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to achieve the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden-paneled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in a hatred position.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the largest lecture hall of the university with choirs of “The army and the people are a hand”.
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the ousted head of state.
But by taking the official oath in court and not as usual in parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque ensures two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Tonight's Friday night is "Pump this party", tomorrow's Saturday night we continue with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed from ladder: severely injured
When replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning toward the roof gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Landeskrankenhaus Salzburg with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana was found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act had triggered nationwide horror.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the trial.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl’s death.
The police initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost daily in South Africa: every year there are about 64,000 complaints about sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s federations in South Africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times darker.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pork cloves, turbo mast is not a good prerequisite.
So can ham, which you get in any supermarket, be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he gets inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted to strengthen fast food in Waldshut
“I’m working on huge quantities here,” the TV makers astounded, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 pounds a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what matters when it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
“I’m looking forward to seeing what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco,” said Jumbo.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is still worth it.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the wedges continues to be manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing are visually reminiscent of a "submarine".
The trick: Fir branches here in the smoke provide the special taste of black forest ham.
Twenty days in smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
“It’s really good,” the TV star said.
This will make it possible for everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual pre-tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million in its earlier forecast.
If the current target values are reached, then that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on track towards record yearly revenues before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK was doing well, while business customers also spent less here.
U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, with earnings expected for the third year in a row for the full year.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are urged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a standalone GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core areas will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a summer speech, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is a “wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public trust,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics — 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year — than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, coalition circles say the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to set up more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from real life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
Once again the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the existing clubs in the district of Soest show here their best animals as well as young wickeder hobby keepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges conducted the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
The visitors of the show are well informed, as the evaluation of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open for all visitors on Saturday from 10 am and on Sunday from 10 am to 3:30 pm, followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola filled with stately prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Palace will be about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Handling of the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Salem Catholic and Evangelical Churches, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much about this and had relied on those images of heaven and hell that "shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is more likely to be characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope has been duly driven out by the criticism of religion,” says the speaker.
“It has provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks.”
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
This is linked to the question of that longing “that dreams that in the end everything may be good”.
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg confirm their creed at the Confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been established.
The service was accompanied in the morning by the Laudato-Si group, in the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the company members had prepared for the great feast day under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous members of the parish.
In various projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced together the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race thrills participants
In beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to make the round trip over the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel from the organising sports club Illmensee tells us.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters in altitude, were also numerous everyone cyclists who wanted to exercise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good positions in the German Championships.
Both of them were able to set themselves off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place was Pascal Treubel.
For the women, it was Theresa Duelli of the team Nightmare, who made it to the top of the winning step.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to separate themselves from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate have been world champions in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German championship titles in duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was a lash-final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Just one second behind it, the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized process of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that lacked the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o’clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision ripe to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries over the past year.
He became a physician and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive with the lace-up medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages in need of help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and wave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team begins examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a 60-kilometre radius around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreational area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s a gruelling feat, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of an intestinal rupture he had received now allowed him to work again.
“This is changing the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s asleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a sophomore at Drexel University in Philadelphia studying medicine and volunteering in Bwelles’ group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help stain blood or consider the instruments to be Dr. Bwelle,” explains O’Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For wave, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives, thus fulfilling a promise he made to his Father, gives him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his craft of acting.
No one can trick the old man Santiago into fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of life, bending down in the chair, that is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is far and wide on stage as a solo actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: The hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings with her songs and her magnificent voice the feeling of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewerage channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne do not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers protrude into the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne’s underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too large remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most users of the car park therefore today also rush past the Roman remains and only leave their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal lattices on the parking deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins of hand plate-sized stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before going back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants take a look at a dark 15-metre-deep shaft on the upper level of the park.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants climb down again into the depths.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "City of Roman law and city of the Agrippinians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor’s palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is preserved here on about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikva, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, it will take a few more years to complete.
Leg almost chopped off: New edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker milieu is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Regional Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rock scene and belonged to the bandidos at the time.
The prosecutor accuses them of having stabbed and beaten three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, a chase with several cars was preceded.
According to the indictment, it was about district struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in an initial trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the verdict after reviewing the prosecutor's office and referred it back to the district court for further trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offense.
The beginning was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes during the night.
As a witness, the detective commissioner was invited.
At the center were cell phone conversations of the defendants and other people who had been eavesdropped by the police.
Difficult is that in court rockers almost always stick to a brass law for them — and not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new evidence had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it was going home.
Only: In the stomachs of the people in the passenger and rear seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than chilling to the next drive-in to indulge in a little treat?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco players are noticeable.
Because what has to be missing that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and on parking lots.
“Why?” I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the papers are shading the landscape.
Bags have already covered up transport facilities such as guardrails, causing accidents.
This is what "disposable society" thinks about, but it probably does not even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evenings, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower there.
A few bags would more or less make up nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the towns and towns get too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains have to demand a pledge for their bags.
Obama's Retirement in Health Policy
After fierce criticism yesterday, President Obama made a retraction of his often repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of dismissal from their insurer, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government called it unsurprising that the five percent of the population who took out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say directly to these Americans: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s House hearing was taken up after a dispute with Republican Rep. Billy Long of Missouri on whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily forego state-sponsored insurance to sign a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government had feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on the night of Wednesday on Thursday, and the Israelis blamed for it.
Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Newa missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 says have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: “We do not comment on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai said in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried earlier, partly successful, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” that would be followed by a military response.
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said US spying went “inappropriately far.”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at a softening of the U.S.’s defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had “got too far in some cases.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to “autopilot” when whistleblower Edward Snowden’s explosive revelations about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the US government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the president and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have happened quasi by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so existed, which goes back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, as well as, of course, 9/11.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is fond of killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we learned about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. on counter-terrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism,” said Murphy, a Democrat who sits in the Senate for the first time and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week said the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary, declaring that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his agency is preparing the congressional journey to take place this year, hoping the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to settle for the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Kerry is set to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment of U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is looking for an assignment by Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
The Mainzers have already to renounce the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to conceiving the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra asking for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“Of course, we’re very worried, but we hope she’ll be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is against a bail of 50,000 baht.
Australian reports say she is on holiday in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, following the recent assassination of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, may be trying to improve its beleaguered tourist image, and therefore acquittal comes.
