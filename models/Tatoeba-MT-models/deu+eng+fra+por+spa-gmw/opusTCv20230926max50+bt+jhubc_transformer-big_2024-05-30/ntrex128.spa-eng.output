Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "looking like muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are bewildered by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A Member of the Labour Party Assembly said his group was concerned “that it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A Member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "dissatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation leap from MWP to Muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the denomination of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Welsh Parliament to the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option garnered most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring Assembly President Elin Jones to head, who should send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the name change of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country’s name will be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price you have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the older people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one nor the other.”
He pointed out that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that neighbors regularly go to.”
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after, they will return to the starting point."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who will not help the shrines that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and will therefore accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin, under the direction of the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, said it was the world’s first carillon used by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who left to play the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese would "attempt to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Diving for Locusts in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego’s KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy begging for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that at first he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
,
He had his collarbone shattered,” Hammel observed as he arrived next to the child.
“I yelled at everyone to come out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2,800 trillion and with growth rising compared to falling sales in fashion and homeware, the largest beauty aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successfully surpassed, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time that this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the shelf space that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, the existing L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will be given more space, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first recently opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift toward buying small amounts of food daily at local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will look more and more like shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets in hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is believed to have boosted grocery sales and further monetized these acquisitions.
The supermarket chain’s previous attempt to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion about how to split revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specialized staff who will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offering is designed to suit every need, while an attractive environment and comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, left "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby broke an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to dedicate to the fashion and accessories brand Truly.
This business had compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was "furious" when the golden girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, left no time to devote themselves to Truly, her fashion and accessories brand, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was poised to be a favorite to double Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source commented: “Truly was, by far, Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her going for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow’s headquarters, ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have been in close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night “there was no talk about business issues.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “little presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his mocking “news anchor” voice.
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in reuniting with him after Trump commended the first meeting held in Singapore in June, which he considered a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the U.S. to the first steps towards North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We’ve got along great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of American soldiers back home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but so instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a bit," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure if the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide aid.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, travelling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to cater for earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko’s administration, which faces re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scores against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with an 89-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second club.
The action sent him over the area and headed to the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very early, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just shot."
Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The midfielder of the Blues made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before spinning a dribble near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran off into the midfield.
Afterwards, he made a nice pass into space that took Hazard to the area.
Hazard sat in front of the defense and tossed the ball into the net of the second pole with a left foot kick that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's emergency agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake that unleashed waves as high as six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man as Suspect of Murder After Woman Was Stitched To Death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, which resulted in the arrest of a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his flat, but police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He was perplexed when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Anyone with information is asked to email DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Statue of Parliament Becomes The Last Commemorative Hit For "Rewriting History"
Their prohibition would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking Oliver Cromwell’s figure out of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell may be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than at present, a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A murderous pig attacks a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a rancher in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a sectioned, blood-covered artery near a well at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby piggy bank was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and shattered," the cousin, addressed by his last name, Wu, told The Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40am to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, as police gathered evidence at the scene.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, it is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 kilograms cornered a farmer in his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After pigs ate an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
We have to have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy, widespread rains in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at 5 a.m. (Eastern Time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to propel the intense tropical rains north, southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain hits the approaching low pressure, there will be heavy widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible desert shedding.
Intense tropical rains will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions may occur.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into muddy rivers and storms will cause gusty winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rainfall in specific parts of Southern California’s coast.
Torrential rains may leave as much as two inches of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some intense temperature changes will be observed in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and re-expand.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm start to October is expected, with widespread temperatures hovering around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees could be reached in New York, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of above-average temperatures for the eastern US during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the appearance of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed the harrowing testimonies that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, policy was still at a standstill and the media was disrupting its usual programming to relay Friday’s latest news: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken state and that he tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that hadn’t happened.
More than the 20.4 million people Nielsen commented on Friday are likely to have seen it.
The company accounted for the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it into perspective, it’s an audience similar to an American football game of the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose audiences have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, fuelled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC had $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million and CNN had $2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, he continued to show great interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters screamed at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend an appearance before the Judiciary Commission.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was dismayed.
“Looking at me in the face,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
The cable and broadcasting networks broadcast everything live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy to the Senate to be voted on.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of ‘Doing Politics’ With Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on the alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, claiming that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge the other’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson showdown, and police say Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bond of US$350,000 has been set up, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge East District Instructional Court released a preliminary report Friday indicating that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police Fugitives Unit, the State Police Forensics Laboratory, Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked local law enforcement for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
Volcano tosses ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and jolts.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police confront Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riots as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by riot police threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are normally filled with tourists.
Clashes also occurred in later hours and police used batons to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with messages such as "neither forgetting nor forgiving," cried out to unionist protesters "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although turnout was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to avoid a rally in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but she was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, the pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for storming a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly storming a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston 1-0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers with their second loss to Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, with Gary Holt up one place, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s have not yet achieved any away wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, the leader of the table with eight points of advantage.
Earlier, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston is expanding its streak of division wins to six games, with starting coach Holt not yet tasting the loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a blunt visitor
Holt's team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow got the deflected shot after entering to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with standing ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave them a free throw and Livingston sought an inning, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but couldn’t get past the host’s defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was pretty calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Allan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper, turned down a shot from Scott Pittman with a kick, and Lithgow was far from another move from Livingston.
Two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over alternate Glenn Middleton and the other for one hand.
Livingston's "Phenomenal" (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and squad have barely experienced changes since his promotion, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the plays, as they only managed to get into the opposing field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see its president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but died there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being run over by a vehicle that escaped on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison’s Directorate.
The riots began at the Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (referred to as a "Tornament") are in charge of controlling the altercations, involving eight inmates and affecting a pavilion.
Officers received assistance for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specialized prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, riot agents were asked to go to the prison to face a serious altercation in which the prison staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last puddles from Hurricane Rosa cross the desert’s southwest, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain in late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had retained their tropical storm or depression status within a radius of 321 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Escarpe, Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other parts of the southwestern desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to retake into Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," as reported on weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north of Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
“The main danger of Rosa or its remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered the pettiness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the pettiness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the meeting about this accusation.
On Saturday, the president said that, on that day, the “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s cunning, quality and courage.”
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record in public service,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“Five weeks to go before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but it's a race," he said.
"That's why I'm going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates."
Trump claimed Democrats are embarking on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to be held no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been swept away by the huge waves ravaging the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When yesterday it was warned that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything on land," said Nugroho. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's large earthquake was 200 times higher than the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast by the time the alert was issued.
In a footage captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man is heard standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking ahead buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although World Vision staff in Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarps installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups were putting disaster assistance gears in motion, some people lamented that the movement of experienced aid workers to Palu was not allowed.
According to Indonesian legislation, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a catastrophe at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the heartbreaking stories that write about natural disasters.
A small child was taken out of a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, instructor for Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“From my experience in the field of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” she said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, their messages only showed one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves seize $26,750 during ATM recharge in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves raided a Brink employee who was recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for reloading.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will start calling himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
It’s been a while since the 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye, which he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“It’s you, it’s us, it means us.
It went from Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in upper or lower case, with or without script.
Mexican AMLO vows not to use army against civilians
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexican president-elect, has vowed never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were gaining ground throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerged from I.A. announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacked an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. We have our eyes on the next breakthrough in the field of I.A.”
Double funding means twice the chance that the next big I.A. achievement will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello's best American player. He later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be the next, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking the academic leaders; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its I.A. initiatives.
“I think I.A. doctors should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they will change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would change to "Republic of North Macedonia," a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its candidacy for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The ballot of the referendum asked the following question: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a name change of the country that would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and removed chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter like Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says joining NATO would provide much-needed investment in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute assured that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which means a smaller turnout than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero avoids all of Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory Manchester City won Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He raced between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green t-shirts.
He evaded a defense before surpassing several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English striker used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that hit the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League race.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball deep within the Brighton territory.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before directing Sterling to the second club.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before breaking out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies' party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they, who triumphed over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Western Division, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
“While we didn’t play anything, we can at least step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander’s record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump gives a rally in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection to the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
"In November everything we have done is at stake.
Five weeks to go before one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s one of the most important. I don’t run, but it’s a race, so I go from one place to another fighting to get great candidates,” he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all the necessary means, you see the meanness, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
“We’ve seen it these past four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Commission by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received public boos.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, mmm, I expect an answer. Her body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of opinions.
They are intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Members of Parliament of the Labour Party who are told that they are not welcome, and just for saying what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of responsible economic policy, in the area of national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were matters in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "kinder and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it was actually applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether the party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and take positions he would never have agreed with, either on national security or on the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a barrage of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every “censorship” motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I’ve received a lot of advice that recommended me to keep my head down and not make me hear so much and that it would be “okay.”
But I haven't gotten into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the Thatcher government’s negligence that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support improving public services for those who need them most, whether as a councilor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political positions or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my fidelity to the leader of the Labour Party when the country goes head-on to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the voters, whether they are from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political opportunism will prevent me from acting on what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the game may have decided to some extent the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining game of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
They now top the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better seize the opportunities, that bestowed the victory on the home team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie commented, “Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, a Warriors loan for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a penalty, before scoring and turning a solo test, which left the score in 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the break.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and the rehearsal by Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to take out on a stretcher, and, upon resuming the match, the Ayr advanced with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Ayr captain Blair Macpherson allowed Melrose to re-enter that they had one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson by scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong in a kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the bottom to get the fifth rehearsal of the venue.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the catering sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move on to the catering sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a source for the Scottish Sun said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering catering market".
"The sea belongs to us": a landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, navy blue flags fly.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Getting it back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without a sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the yearning to return to sailing the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia expects an International Court of Justice resolution on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision comes just six months after the final pleadings indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia’s cause, it may have been numbed in the last four years.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “putting an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear matters stalled more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is wary of accepting the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, widespread skepticism reigns over Pyongyang’s seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or protect yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented a set of eccentric oversized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons with jewels, a wizard’s hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of quirky masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation was reminiscent of a complete diving team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like oversized fashion, you’re in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats come with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this impractical hat that flooded social networks presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as big as the model in swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I expect to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to the world’s citizens
Scotland’s independent educational centres have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary test scores that is bolstered by individual and collective successes reaped in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the highest level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message gets to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that, if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
Taking into account this year’s recent test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the leaderboards, with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of the students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the United Kingdom’s Commission on Employment and Skills found that, of the reasons employers gave for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17% were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities requiring languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and the only two-digit language spoken, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Scotland’s independent educational centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opening game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted in a tweet that James was likely to play a limited few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at places with supporters like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nominee’s confirmation vote to fill the vacant Supreme Court vacancy pending, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who were strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have put an early Senate confirmation vote on hold for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election gain momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said next week’s five rallies aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come and give him a push in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team proves they dare to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday’s individual games.
After three individual sessions, maybe Saturday afternoon foursomes are what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum swing pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
"They took us six points ahead and now they take us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost," Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in favor and plenty of reason to be excited, among other reasons for the pair of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural shouts of celebration rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that the game gave them in the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, from those who transmit who believe that the American team has not yet been left out.
“We need to redouble our efforts and focus on the game,” Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe wears four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way his energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will not be other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball, after partnering with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they couldn’t get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to see up close because you appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead in the final day, but this foursome session also demonstrated that the U.S. team dared to fight, something some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe ahead 10-6 on last day of Ryder Cup
Europe left with a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 result over the United States.
The motivated duo consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories over a Tiger Woods who was in distress, overtaking four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which finished 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to beat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who in Saturday’s two games hadn’t highlighted too much, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games, and seven straight.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, was again Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world, respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have it all on its part.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting 2-1 win over Ian Poulter and Spaniard Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says there is “no possibility” that they will first unilaterally disarm if they have no confidence
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any similar response from the United States," he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances, there is no chance that we will first unilaterally disarm.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints of Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, including by objecting to a declaration of ending the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the US leader to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the stakeholder in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “a rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in advancing toward disarmament, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline set for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “Imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying advances had taken place, but a few hours later North Korea denounced that his "demands were those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep longer in an attempt to fight the growing sexist culture of all-night studying caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital designed the course, it is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
His motivation to launch the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up and asked me why she just heard about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Afterwards, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride in “sleeping the night” still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are being subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and good quality sleep should be “the secret weapon” of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He pointed out that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about setting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression away from home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted their first home win since a 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 coaching games, leaving their team eight points behind the Hearts, stunned Ladbrokes Premiership leaders.
Menga's attack occurred just minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired line-up wasn't up to it at any point.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth, Livingston go up to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may find themselves in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to get medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly tossed an object from the visitor's bottom.
Gerrard changed eight of the starters who won the match against Ayr, entering the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who pulled a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his highly organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored within two minutes of the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs took a deep foul for captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two goal shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely struggling to cope with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitch.
Although Livingston’s 34th-minute goal came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a deep ball play by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher snapped the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to lead visitors to exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow scored a cornerhead that didn't enter.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTAINING... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despotize against the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to someone white and he asks me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with Matt Damon's sketch in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's taunt to social media.
It’s unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the post.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a hard time behind the scenes wearing that cap.
"They messed with me.
I was told not to go out with the cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how asleep I am?" and added, "He was going to put on his superman cloak, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments received public outcry on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West baffled many when he went on stage to sing I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING MUCH DUMBRE."
Interview show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider is embracing and spreading an ideology dangerous to my community.
He's free.
We, too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed the name, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been named Snoop Lion, not to mention the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying those on-screen roles often conveyed to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and was questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones cast mate, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she finds it "quite important" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think it’s pretty important right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television may be part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "suffering with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, the play by Sam Shepard that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he’s ever done about Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she’s given me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 on a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced by almost all, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT group suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican senators, saying it was "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were driven by “far-right” commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies," Waters said in a tweet.
Supposedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person at the Capitol posted the information online during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a member of Waters staff, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement prompted immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“You deny this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the accuser's motives.
He must maintain calm and serenity.”
It appears Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to unseat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” he continued, “and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English review: Rowan Atkinson's spy parody falls short
Now it has become a tradition to look for nods to Brexit in any new film with a British focus. It seems that this is what it is to do with this new installment of the parody action comedy franchise Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satire about how clearly foolish we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his bouncing eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to screw up for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, it’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretenses of squandering glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of Cars of Fire that was touched at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
In addition, it was originally based on the mysterious traveler and international man depicted years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s already forgotten TV commercials, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers collided with the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes to mind, but the humor gets pretty short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comical ingredients seamlessly.
Humor seems more directed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures are not as witty and clever as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents to the dismay of the agent on duty, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that fills the glass for the Prime Minister, a pompous and cornered character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script does not leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a cocky school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering former buddy Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a sympathetic role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not exploited enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the perilous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos hiding on Volta's luxurious yacht; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in the latter sequence, but, as funny and squeaky as it is, the ensemble continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but would charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the working-class economy as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
At the moment, however, not the entire Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and will not be discussed at this time.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to lay out his idea of carrying out a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to reclaim powers from "anonymous" and "used" directors in charge of companies that provide public services.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that current shareholders of the water companies will not regain their full shareholding, as a Labour government could apply deductions corresponding to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and create inclusive ownership funds in which 10% of the shares of private sector companies must be allocated to employees, which would give them annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as Supreme Court magistrate for at least a week and also raises the question of whether the results could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to air Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring out information that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was steadfast, determined, and steadfast.”
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the indictment,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it sharply," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names has been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive poster of stars gathers in favor of an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people move to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness-raising group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concertgoers have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has Global Citizen achieved 12 years from reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clictivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Through these actions, they claim to have got world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 225 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that arose from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is “The Power of Nutrition”, a UK-based association of investors and enforcers united in the common commitment to “help children grow and develop to their full potential.” To this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens contributors.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice from malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for “The Power of Nutrition,” told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also stated that, after carrying out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have already achieved, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to carry out blockade of Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington could resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods of addressing this issue.
“The United States, with its navy, has the ability to ensure that the waterways remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that the energy does not end up in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he warned while pointing out that Russia can only do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relegate it from function to Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will make Berlin hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is solely for economic reasons and is yet another sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The American stance has been met, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was taking up this challenge.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and for women to finally be among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and said he was “leading the country down the wrong path.”
“I’m really concerned about the harm Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said, “It is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
A poll was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at a Donald Trump Rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, for everything he has been through since he returned, is very well known to the other families suffering from the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers return with,” he told the audience who gathered at a pro-Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, commenting on his son and other war veterans who “return with a different behavior, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the military, have given their country.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of an episode of domestic violence against a woman who interferes with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial recourse to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” letter Friday in Washington to show support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been disclosed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states that defend Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in the country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made a statement Friday saying the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
“According to federal law, all asylum applications must be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the lawsuit and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also said in the letter that the policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and "suppose a necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“Persons who leave their countries of origin on the grounds of persecution or threats on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced on a daily basis by people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly disastrous.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her fevered baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for the few remaining drenched belongings in an effort to recover what is possible for them.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals, also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the building due to continuous, also very strong, aftershocks.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while he was on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the wreckage of the collapsed wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're okay."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the payment supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, something that China bluntly denies.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials pointed to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports from both sides.
China’s compensatory tariffs that were applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, who is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad postings in our free press.”
“In an attempt to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government relies on the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press by attempting to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China can have on the worrying trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by firm pressure from the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers circumvented the offer to publish" his article, although it did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts say Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of midterm vote with Kavanaugh's debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially by women, in the upcoming mid-term votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and many Republicans have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
“On these kinds of issues it’s not possible to back down,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation will be enough to appease voters upset with this matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the Senate doors chanted "November is coming!" as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of all perspective,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among indecisive women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a setback could occur if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, NBC News reported.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee vote or the final vote, or even whether they sit on the bench for Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a few more are on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony definitively or probable, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh’s testimony definitively or probable.
In addition, 38% said they thought that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her when she was drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend. A company that is based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to "dominate the world."
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
One thing that is unique in personal online data storage is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
For the time being, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the on-the-job developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change is going to be introduced where all their business models are completely modified overnight.
“We are not going to ask permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate over net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and guns."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so big that I'll never be able to reach his height, but they were very sobering."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath of flowers after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was “a privilege for him to be a part of the parade,” adding that “the value of a true hero is evident when shown such a large support.”
MMA fans were up all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to see the whole Bellator 206 so that in the end they won’t let you see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the switch to cartoons as "a heavy joke."
“There is government regulation that regulates content that airs from 6 a.m. and this wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to kids’ programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the piggy, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they will modify the show to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
"When I think about the relay option, I think it can work," Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the scheduling was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We'll cut it down to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we've normally done. We tried to offer more than usual so the fans were happy and we passed.
It's a very unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At 24, he told us he didn’t realize until he came to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said her intention in talking about gay rights was to convey "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to downplay the fact of winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, is going to be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who portrayed himself as an outcast, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wasn't disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to claim that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to convey that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but said age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so long since you were so young" (it was to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global outlook" had changed.
“If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have revolved around ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
Her son is named after her father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the London 2012 passes, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be able to be in the front row,” he said.
“He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympics, there was nothing better,” he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him when choosing his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering in a few moments and, in others, trying to perfect his game on the field and be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continuously punishes with wrong shots.
And, if the field is no longer daunting enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, started impressively, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role I had today, he slapped me on the back and, circling me with his arm, he said he would be prepared tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it should be.
He wants to be there, just like the rest of us.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record of more Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of a whole Ryder Cup trajectory that had never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he said.
"I think the younger players have been delighted to have him as support, also this week; it was fun.
It brings so much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership may disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that even if you enter with a substantial advantage in the final days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn into an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end only managed to take the others by stepping on their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we did it at Brookline too and we lost, we did it at Valderrama and we won, but for very little,” Bjorn said, portrayed after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead it with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Go out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the dots are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what’s on the other side where they are, no more and no less than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I don’t want to get ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow is individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, you’re testing your entire golfing ability.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as pairs, with the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends in the final days of those big tournaments and has been part of the winning team at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe held the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the final day.
“We have 12 super-important matches tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the entire course," Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but will not be made until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressively rising costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery annoyed the completion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that requested the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very reduced acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be already outdated when they begin to serve, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship practically useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half the staff on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is excessively overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), instead of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems that are attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in light of the recent warnings about the reduction of the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is “lacking ships capable of deploying.”
The official said the problem has been getting worse over time, because the old ships were dropped, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state in the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything found is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as river bats from Daubenton and long-eared browns from the Inverewe Gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind,
Because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts in the field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a fantastic bat zone,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there is still a lot unknown about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be inadvertently destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would annihilate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations at the same time his lawyers are persecuting German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, 33-year-old Ronaldo branded the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” says the five-time Ballon d’Or winner looking into the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to make themselves famous by just mentioning me, but I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit to Der Spiegel over allegations that appear in what they have called “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents recorded in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had disappointed that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to police and that they took photographs of the injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to reach an out-of-court settlement because she had "terror of reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old says she is trying to overturn the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, an Italian football major for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would always regret losing automakers
The UK would “repent for life” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of customs delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 percent were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have expressed their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially regarding cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns raised by automakers revolve around issues that could arise on assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” mode of production, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to manufacture cars on demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union on 29 March without an agreement, there could be a border disruption that the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case, production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid such controls at border crossings.”
“We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to seize the opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today show.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what, so far, has been a tremendously successful supply chain set.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be halted, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover."
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan defining our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “postpone another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump aids and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectation of whether or not Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself was wearing to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amid news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who at the time was at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiloquently, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they brag."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
“The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him,” he said, while quoting without evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option to directly ask the president of the United States, I think it’s much better to do them to me.
We tried many times and you’ve seen us do so many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president showed why it was so, where he made a casual and, on bizarre occasions, appearance to the journalists who were gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to stay with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central government.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit in which they chose to make the decisions expected this fall have followed.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know that all this must be very bewildering for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie had emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the bandline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to a thorough examination.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there were no details yet about the type of injury or the damage caused” and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore redshirt, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher property transfer tax when they purchase property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to shelter the “homeless,” according to new plans from the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in property transfer tax will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year that will go to the “homeless”
The additional money raised with the increase in the transfer tax on estates to foreign buyers of properties in the UK will go to aid to the “homeless”, Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in the estate transfer tax will be taxed on people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will go to incentivize government policy to combat the problem of begging in the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
An estimated 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by non-UK residents, causing rising prices and making it difficult for people who buy for the first time to access affordable housing.
Many of the country's wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a transmission tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big builders of maintaining very high prices on properties by avidly buying land without intent to use it and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too hard for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become coach of Scotland at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the League One (England's third league division), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s something that’s always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he passed on to such established names at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club correspond, without a doubt, to those of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can get the club back to where it should be.”
Ross has only been coaching for three years, after a time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the brink of descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over Alloa.
“I always believed that management was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I could make a living very well with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life when I’ve felt better, without a doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits at British pubs struggling to survive, but concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups of pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant earnings fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin of CGA, which was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: “The heat of these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in July, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8 percent, although restaurants have fallen even a little more.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs that primarily serve meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market of out-of-home activities.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be especially painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents’ backs
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, a survey reveals
The survey, conducted among 20,000 high school students, revealed growth in fake Instagram pages
News has sharpened fears of sexual content being posted
20% of students said they have a "main" account that they show to their parents.
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced on fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
News has sharpened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they had a clean "main" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who happened to find her 13-year-old daughter’s secret location saw a teenage boy encouraging others to “rape” me.
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be the "voice of athletes" in Scotland's athletics federation board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to serve on the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having her on its board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to bring things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn how to walk again, and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
Breastfeeding announcement comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A breastfeeding company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the “world’s first silent breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers telling about the freedom the new breast pump gives them.
Four royal women dance in a barn full of hay as a dance floor, along with cows, with lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself alone, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Kill them, milk them, I'm feeding their babies, milk them, milk them, I'm milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a major controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to put the focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before giving birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken from their babies days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who do stay with their babies?"
Another comment was: "What a crazy ad."
Others, however, defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "destiny."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I could still breastfeed, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I don’t turn it around anymore.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person told us: "It's a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pump their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly engages inside the breastfeeding bra, allowing its users to move around, hold their babies and even take to the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, tells us: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and up-close way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two marched down the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to a Texas Border Camp
The number of detained immigrant children has risen considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels. This is partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration government entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Bureau, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will testify by videoconference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those who are not considered eligible for protection will be deported as soon as possible.
According to shelter workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood of anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or attempts to flee.
Advocates say these concerns are growing even more at larger facilities, such as Screw, where signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked due to their size.
In addition, moving to camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, French, Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue “will be dealt with accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is practically over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were right for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that caused the refugees to decide to stay out of the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel’s work should be restricted to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, peak time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has surpassed cable channel ratings with 3.5 million viewers for major nightly news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we still can’t comprehend,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” was the response Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike everything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can reunite, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (“a garment of excessive pride,” in the words of The Washington Post’s Storm Post) and the implications of the scabs of Daniel.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes it all look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks to us about the alternating cast of Trump’s show and his daily plot twists (whether entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to talk this week with Mr. Fleiss, it was a 27-degree sunny day off the north coast of Kauai, but he was sheltered inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to take on the Senate Judiciary Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all these crazy shows and people were telling us that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in tighter House midterm elections
Not surprisingly, the influx of money is coming to the 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This recently redesigned Pittsburg residential district has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has unleashed a campaign funding battle between the party’s main financial arms, the Democratic National Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, though after pushing back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials decided to return heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of about 140 million US dollars in 2017 for, among other things, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they intended the conference to move forward, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, as diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton’s White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to treat the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next planned step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence on the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign worked in parallel with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand again before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of constraints, and with that I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the war.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler; it was only necessary that the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a good spot since this newspaper reported that last year it had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the F.B.I.’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his office in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
On top of all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will face a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I don’t think we will fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians, following the impressive Spain draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you can see a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is doing well, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I’m hopeful that we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is making some women sleepless
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be looked after, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about this issue.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company, tells us.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children – you won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a cost-determining factor.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion as it can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: stay ahead of legal battles.
Take care of obtaining a health care power to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You can also prepare a power of attorney for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you become disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: which doctors do you have to deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to have everything planned.”

The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to increase.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Belt of Fire, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers from frequent earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that affected the southern coastline, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya’s regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalls the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that resulted in the deaths of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin has been ordered pretrial detention at Mat-His Pretrial Facility and is held on unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and possessing a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he punched him in the face.
Several veterans’ groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of fatalities
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Exceptionally Seek Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out an attack last October on a bike lane on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists he found in his path.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to request the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed with Saipov a 22-count indictment that included eight organized crime murder charges, which federal prosecutors typically use in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov carried out it as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
MP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to “feel the heat” of eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should handle negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have left” had Farage been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Prime Minister May to reconcile her divided ranks has highlighted even more as a pro-permanence Tories group has joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers amid attacks by pro-Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and "chaos".
MP Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position with responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: “I just say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favor and is not popular among our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: Prime Ministers keep their posts when they keep their promises.
Farage told Concentrates that politicians would have to be made to “feel the heat” if they were seen to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are going to mobilize the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-permanence marched through the streets of Birmingham ahead of the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists were waving Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security concerns they had with a party application during the conference’s opening.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement the computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for border in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland.”
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider every chance of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a city meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
An Arrested for the Gun Murder of the LSU Sims Player
Baton Rouge police said Saturday they arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately led to his death," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team orders hand him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that orders from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in the queue of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes came out forcefully one lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook after an action with the wheels almost glued that made the Ferrari driver have to reluctantly leave the free interior at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race while clinging to his tyres to achieve a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually, he entered boxing on lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen fourth place.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman in letting me through.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting a perfect match,” Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and how good it is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But if I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal did not seem to fit in well with the president, who commented during Saturday night’s rally, “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's return game 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal lead thanks to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the home draw before Dwyer restored Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard matched for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan put the local team back on the eagerness to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again equalled the match with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game as he reached the end of the second half and secured victory with his team's fifth goal as they approached the end.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Even though his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was being hit by a heavy rocking.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian channel ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many corpses under the ruins and many people could not be contacted," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told us.
Waves that reached as high as six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought in on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared, after it said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon you could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through water reaching their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors doing near a dock upgrade also aided in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Aviation safety net data indicates that 111 people have been killed in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors ended their arguments Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers's for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took to the podium on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s pickup truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my pickup truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would be in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims hip hop strayed from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a 'racist' text
A New York nanny will sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies that he is racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day at work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her paw sting, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and was instead waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with intent to receive compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that things don’t get done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s a discrimination case.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that Maurice’s termination of employment was the most reasonable thing, as they feared they could not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife had sent him something I didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go for someone that way?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s so funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before drawing inspiration from a toy bear to write the children's book, hoped his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "sweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t like to boast,” he said.
“But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost like you had a son who accomplishes something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep pumping his heart were slowly depleting and leaving his system.
She had died before time and everything was going out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t howl, scream, or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the terrible experience she was experiencing.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and tears fell on me all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicides is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicides are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis’s son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up anywhere.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards "so that people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies’s for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he tells us.
A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He's left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread as the FBI begins investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what I was requesting (a time-limited, limited scope investigation), maybe we could bring some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "going to a brink" amid a partisan shutdown.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
If, as expected, Republicans do poorly, their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, pushing them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Numbers of North Korean Defectors ‘fall’ with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high tariffs charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of northern deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Hysterical' and Says He's Unfit to Serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was a hysterical woman,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
On the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his view, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and that Democrats would get a majority in the House.
“I’ll just say one thing: if you’re not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you won’t be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, you won’t even be fit to be in the court where you’re now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to find that everything is all right,” Pelosi said.
And women have to take it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of fury overflowing, and she can’t let go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, do I?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive at some company and who told me that she too was crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I kept doing what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for rabies in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my early jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once that I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An elderly woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the drop and dragged me onto a staircase.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he told me.
“They have no idea you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad because they think you’ve been cornered.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came up with no reason not to explore the idea of her running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already well advanced, he was left behind in fundraising, so it was promised that he would not re-enter the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech announcing that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to raise funds and focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she choked.
"The logical thing would have been to think that he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction from the press.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"He cried"?
U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while there is still a long way to go before the battle ends, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by putting tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs hitting $200 billion ($150 billion) in goods, charging half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. strikes, and the world’s second most powerful economy is unlikely to loosen soon.
Getting Washington back would mean yielding to the demands, but submitting publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could help China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions for initiating a sharp economic downturn in either country is actually much more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused associate researcher for the Center for New American Security strategic cabinet.
Syria Ready for Refugees to Return, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has already been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech earlier at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods have already been met.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The United States now has six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 against the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very hard year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy that I was able to recover the cup.
It’s an achievement of the whole team and I’m very happy to have been able to help,” said an excited Garcia after the European team’s victory.
Now he passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods as I have grown up seeing this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to fight throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we ruined it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now we have to bow our heads.
They have overtaken us.”
