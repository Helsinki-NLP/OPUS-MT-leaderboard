The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# major customer and so it's not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction which I should enclose the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting it?
I also think that children should not be encouraged to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as you can be a child, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can tell yourself if this is right for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and go with him to sleep for hours.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
Because if actually something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, I don’t want to think of the title all over again, maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and about treating it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by feeding himself and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation at his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer anonymously assigned to go to the place of the suicide and document and put the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that is suppressed in the brain an anxiety center and the patients ultimately face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death with intent)
This fear is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the rough plot I am quite sure that the book in the original was written by a French author / author.
If anyone knows this story or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh yes, I do not have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference remitted?
Child, 4 years, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood chips under the thumbnail (outside).
They tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It masters the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders log in fully automatically to a suitable digital central.
He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable centrals.
For centrals that can only program the CVs of 1-255 exist auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 ride steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin<0xC2><0xAE> braking distances as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake components or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An automatic ABC pendulum pulling system allows automatic penduluming between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC paths.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to boost vaccination
Increasingly new omicron cases are procuring politics and science in the UK.
By the new year, all qualifying adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress on corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising omicron numbers than hitherto aspired.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to get a booster dose by the end of the year, provided it has been at least three months since the second vaccination, Johnson said Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Given the omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
“Let yourself be boosted now!” said Johnson.
On Sunday, another 1239 omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm for everyone to come up with pronouns.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick an officer on my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had an inconspicuous shortcoming in sales.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since approx.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about my soul.
I (21) more often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or think we could not help them.
I know we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can’t do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing I cannot reach all.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, which is so impossibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series worth to "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick was relied.
Again nothing: for the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomach."
After the game, however, it did not settle - but increased again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) - defeat in the basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result, the manner of the appearance disappointed.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma should be mentioned as a substitute: The three-person ratio was only 13 percent, 4 hits (all by the young Johannes Patrick) with a whopping 31 attempts - still questions?
In response, John Patrick said, “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife and didn’t implement what we trained.”
Namely, to move the ball.
His opponent Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a horny game for the second time against Ludwigsburg", said the happy coach.
“It felt like it was before 10,000 people.”
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
T.J. Shorts scored 22 points and led his team's game.
“The best gamer I’ve ever trained,” Gleim praised.
While in Patrick’s team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after already 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there isn’t much time left to fight.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore contacted them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always as if out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there will be nothing of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "by official instruction" to contain the coronavirus.
Other performances planned in the Advent season must also be cancelled, as it is called on the website of the singer, who today turns 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to catch up with their dates already moved due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and liked it as a teenager.
He studied operatic singing in Berlin, and founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - just like his hit album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - reached second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer out of the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?
It is to be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it fits color
It still does not work I can only crave the cover sheet but do not flip.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by expropriation
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the assurance that their rent will remain affordable for the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts, as to how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation did not relax, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been drawn through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to be lamented.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes in the U.S. have wreaked havoc, potentially killing as many as a hundred people.
The storms leave a 320-kilometre-long trail of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was raging, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
In the state of Kentucky alone, he expects up to a hundred deaths, with official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That's a pity.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had returned an artike or a return via the contact form and wanted to inquire if this arrived or will be processed, as I have not yet received a B confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for the vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls – following the German model – is also intended to increase readiness for corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company he blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn’t stick to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time, well, it didn't matter.
He didn't like his job, either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm making a screenshot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to the greeting!
For a group of 4 friends, I’m running the adventure Over the Grip Pass and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are devised and now I am about to write the entry adventure and stumble upon my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to bring a truck with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action will take place.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins are supposed to lure the heroes into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threat, detect the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins lurk at the hero in a hollow path and flank to each of three left and right arches, the vehicle armed, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village school, a half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
Should defeat be inevitable, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and come to the hero's aid in battle.
The car is still there, all great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as a start to the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later, so it is not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to heed many of your ideas and have more confidence in my narratives now.
I built the lamp apart again.
And back together.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
Then if you can let the receipts come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything be picked up again or only the storage room part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, in the middle of the F2 race today, the transmission was canceled in order to start the F1 preliminary reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind the planning, but you could still have shown the last (scheduled) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons the F1 enjoys priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still, it’s stupid, especially since Sky UK has put the race to a close.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again inconsistency with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you could change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, they did not come to the decision that Verstappen could change the tyres until there were corresponding radio claims on this issue to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should simply know such basic rules when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guess, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in terms of rules.
In general, I don’t like the crafted commentary style of Roos, but admit that it’s a matter of taste.
But I really like even Heiko Water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, which makes both simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with the (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the run-off round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to it on F1TV since only the German soundtrack without comment has to make it right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Also, these two stations do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironisch makes RTL a better job in the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump are also suitable to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (find us in the shop) or with a decor, which convert the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be to call a treasure chest, shell or the like.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or the like... and you can start.
The fan pump should be the same, or higher, as the water level and be installed outside.
If the fan pump sits lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards once the water from running out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it, like other air pumps, should be covered and protected from moisture
MK series pumps are pure power packs that use little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, it is packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily here.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the forwarding sector... of course here does not stop Corona.
Please do not rate equally poorly, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course you like to scold about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard
This is also very regionally different.
Don’t be evil to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly chosen astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue room suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: the space engineer Cameron's son, Belan Unn Dick Taylor, Evan.
How much they paid for each ticket, Blue Origin did not tell.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his assignments and do everything himself.
She was just like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 km altitude
The New Shepard missile system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, sometimes with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again slowed off by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above Earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: The first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before my studies, but I also thought at the time that I would like to study until the doctorate and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially depressing my career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you always hear great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you always hear of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
I would be really interested:
1) What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study / what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your responses!
I am currently really insecure and I may be thinking about canceling my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have any experience, you’d like to write it :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's only now a post.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also the ones before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week Mary Ascension, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So last week there was a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
All e-mails that absolutely had to be sent out before the driveway, order here order there, everything *unconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What is the purpose of this self-disease because of holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we are not allowed to indulge in them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is simply: are we the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts at all.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will be attuned to the feast by baking and crafting cookies with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time I don't have any gifts yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouse and the formation of feathers.
NEKTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird farming is solely due to nutritional defects.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin supplement should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still does not work
GDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was also designed in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the proposed conversion of the model railway company ME Heft 11/1968, used with tracks and defective parts see photos, function well, The series E 95 is a heavy goods railway company in Germany.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are working on it
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined, via the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and found themselves thereafter on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as a repair product.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Dessau railway improvement plant, the reworkability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] As the re-electrification of the Central German network increased, the three E 95 01 to E 95 03 locomotives were reworked in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
Here, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger quantities were first preferably constructed.
It was not until the E 94 that it was clear that the number of work-ups could not be increased further, that the E 95 moved into the focus of the work-up.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway company.
They came to the railway plant Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematic with increasing age was the complicated control of the locomotives.
Thus, it was more and more common for shooters to stick during switching operations.
Then the sideman constantly driving on this locomotive had to release the shooter again during the trip with a hammer and wooden wedge.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new building locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could dispense with old locomotives and most types of splinters, so that the E 95 were decommissioned.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility conditions of the driver's booth.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to leave service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was thus never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at Halle Central Station.
It took some time before those responsible for the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive began to be developed externally with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is supervised.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Hall P have been working on the operational processing of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching secondary routes, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area was initially Silesia.
manual model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworks on the locomotive necessary in own work, dusted, with traces of play, basement smell !!!, very rare manual model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small-series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage tracks.
The F-parts are
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The center beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do now?
I can't build the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced defectively.
The central beam does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent off?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones of the mold, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-digit euro area, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was deliberately set on fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But then it comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin has not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had caused him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he is getting a vaccine against the coronavirus.
On social media, there was false information that I was not supposed to be vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the biontech pfizer vaccine," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin wrote in a post on the network "LinkedIn" on Friday.
"For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself on which I am being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He struggles with a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview circulates with Deutsche Welle, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as also the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany in the vaccination of the vaccination.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been cancelled - and the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own information.
Fires in substations: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, probably no heating.
A fire had crippled a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to live without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire on Friday night turned out the lights for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, since the Westnetz-monteurs could initially only resume some lines provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching system at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, complex cleaning and repair work is needed.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday, 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually accessed from 9.30 pm.
Since 11:15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the failure has also been used.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies have been in operation.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings, the authorities had also called for neighborhood help on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighborhoods and inform local fire departments when help is needed," said Deputy Mayor Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power units, the focus was mainly on the residents of old people’s homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places have been set up in schools for those people who have not been able to provide for themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good morning. Good morning.

This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 explanations of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can’t push it together and shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Can you send me the return ticket by email?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We disagree with this

To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you put the brush on the model with a new color for the first time, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly next to the line.
Light overlapping of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones might appear later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can result in unpleasant metal slips when mixed with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before you build them up.
The models achieve an original look through the decals or decals.
From landmarks on airplanes to ship names to trim strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Place the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still well accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be easily glued before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpick are time, patience and a calm hand when gluing.
Cut out each decal you need and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slides because you briefly moisten their backside with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wetness.
Then you just drag the picture off a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check to see if the image fits correctly before you pull it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to the finger, crease or even tear.
Suction excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly, as soon as I look for something else then I no longer read the book and I have to unsubscribe and register and reload the book and find the place to where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Child wish treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in childbearing treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly turns across.
In turn:
We had applied to the PKV for the fertility train in advance and received the commitment of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was billed with PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and did 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count them with the PKV yet.
We applied again for the cost of the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more tests than promised, logically the most expensive ones count with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to refund 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "the case of insurance begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have had to point out to us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts will lapse?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts gave their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to best reach them again
I'm fine.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
You are welcome to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you tell me that I have to return the thing first.
I don't think I can get the dresser completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We are not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise, you can’t sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the closet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with stools to be purchased in addition, but unfortunately we can not find them with you.
Can you help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low-Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find ample lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer from you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you!
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon, because it just does not work here.
Hello.
"Half-victory" against Belarus entails high costs for the EU
The EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs, however, are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus’ border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in a sustainable way, said the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This hovering state - Belarus does not admit very small, but the EU feels that it is a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not turn resolutely against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens the cohesion in the Union.
“It can’t seem to prevail if a member state sits in its head to do its thing,” as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policies on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: an agreement on the principle of asylum policy will be difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown with stones in the incident not far from the village of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, Border Guard 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants crossed the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as the ruler in Minsk of attracting them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have blocked border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to the people’s countries of origin to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU’s response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the balance sheet and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly lock thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows presume two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had moved on to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Dutchman had overtaken the cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and contact you again
Thanks for the support

Fuchsle, Ed Euromouse and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop.”
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the cooperation between the Bundesligist and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was shown once again how well the partnership fits.
To see radiant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this,” says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

My question is whether my question has been answered.
Not everyone has the time for your tapped chat and mis-delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or woman #NAME# get an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand and a return label.
This email has not yet arrived.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite means nothing.
It's like when an eagle says he has nothing against foreigners.
They will not both admit it to you.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you're not as serious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set it all in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is nothing but nonsense.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to take it seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without forgiveness and color defects down to the edge zone.
Often magnifying glasses are marked with magnification indications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are produced on the lens surfaces of all optical devices – also in the case of impact magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the attached instructions for use (available in German and English).

Pine sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curious situation during the sale of firs.
Once a man is supposed to have driven home even without his partner, because the two could not agree.
Every year, he plantes a good 2,000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas time a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Or am I gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
So both have their name.
In German, perhaps an equivalent would be something like the "turner", which by no means sounds so delicious.
Problems with Fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having trouble building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few outages.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I remove myself in the house with the module, the less it arrives (i.e. use an outlet that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed via the power line is "lost" with fiberglass?
And is LAN really the one solution?
It would be extremely complicated to install LAN cables in the house.
I am really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it is time to change the checking account
Whoever would have thought that now would be calm at the checking accounts for the first time, is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm their past fee increases with all sorts of tricks, the amounts free for negative interest rates also continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered to be relatively generous for a long time, with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered it for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Group division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for checking and investing accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily cash accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements made with existing customers".
Commerzbank had previously fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even been justified in the first instance before the District Court of Berlin against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood.
But their life is like a ride up and down.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a fury in 2021 with the “Friends” reunion and the continuation of her “The Morning Show” series, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers will take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip out of the bag).
That the hearts of the female and male fans still fly at the same time is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and still looking for the great love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
Hopefully success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of career: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tape touch, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishing his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Räikkönen’s biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship at Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole and came to the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup win - Nolte wins in the double bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
"I've figured this out once, I would have to score nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina in 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two wins in two days at the races in Winterberg.
It was only on Saturday that he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed a bit to the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he won in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd in a row.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth after second place this time before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race in eighth place.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won her third win of the season in the doubles.
After scoring only fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-time Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualifiers, she posted the first podium finish this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," Burghardt said, stressing: "It's not only pushing, but there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not-totally error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just did not receive it and therefore can not redeem why I finally asked once.
I had a lot of problems with Corona last year and I never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired which annoyed me very much.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping not starting until 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No until I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken away by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I've also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
Do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe one of them - or some of them...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from that my dog is not screaming or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has had a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because hand is in the bandage wg burning).
He’s cooler on top of that and we’re seeing less of each other right now (1-2x week) which makes me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomachache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now there is also housework on us, which of course we divide up.
But cooking itself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is just quite well set, I am half-way well-treated and can cope.
Not good, but I get along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test for which I have done nothing and the day after anatomy hour for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I will have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until the next day, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I’m packing the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I’m infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can’t put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my KPTBs.
I think this also has a lot to do with mental load of women and that’s why I thought that I’m sure to find female partners here...
I wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly as it was on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Anyway, two times.
But it was not confirmed.
I found out at school that many religious teachers don’t believe in God and it’s just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed somehow.
How do you feel about it?
You may also be able to tell about colleagues at work and or study with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
True culture or something?
I hope the question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or can't?Write it in English, I understand it well.
That's been a long time, then I'd give it up
It's okay, thank you.
I expect a response soon, not later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I think it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First, the modern world (real world).
The past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is created.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm to be able to live for himself I mean.
The transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, the two soldiers fight each other.
If that tells you anything, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little girl only slept on her stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax. Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right, no cuddly animals, often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Axso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Is it turning its head aside?
Can it get up from the stomach?
Or is it face forward directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was like walking and putting the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "customer" with you and have already purchased a lot of items
But why do you offer me only 20 euros?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of you and so far no feedback.
It is about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
To be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It’s just that the politics of this station are now under all the dirt.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It has been said that you are an “independent” Internet broadcaster.
Arno: “You don’t want to be a running pillar.”
What is it now?
An 0815 advertising broadcaster trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
This applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How do you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a call back, as my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Body breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry core pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and give off again in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not so well.
The cherry core cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following applications:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, stick or fire stains and dispose immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then place the inner pillow in the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight formation of moisture on the surface, which, however, disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can cause damage (risk of flame and combustion!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your armrest!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory complaints, fresh hematomas, bleeding and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose seeds leak, dispose of the product and the loose seeds immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during use to prevent overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country where the user is established.
The cover is removable and can be washed in the machine at 30° C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it doesn’t even run under the third coach.
Rejoice in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frust in Ingolstadt after the failed entry under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
Fault indicator, the battery is empty and the laptop will no longer start despite plugging in the power supply.
As a result, I expanded the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when connected to the mains?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don’t know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 litres of capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need on everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to the version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: Once conventional via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
In the closure flap, there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, stably riveted, into which the lock hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top beam, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without latching the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to sneak through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more about this below) and so store both easily separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay securely in the left backpack half and don’t get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if you want to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from your support.

If you renew the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but after all I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.

But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept it in this way.
Roting brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver, who can appreciate reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Roting brake discs are made of cast iron and then machined mechanically (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics specific to specific discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the balance of the disk according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, whereby the cut-outs improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic features of our tuned discs underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered luminous chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were set up, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You’re going to look for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional promotions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), from 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one half of the site - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Players will then alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the bidder turns to a new location and changes the available promotions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. every location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma from a raid of angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are outnumbered by the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final rating takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Former patients and those entitled to education are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourself, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! concern themselves with power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on waiver of the test obligation for triple vaccinated
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide waiver of the test obligation for triple vaccinated.
"We countries quickly need clarity on whether and from when the test obligation can be waived for three times vaccinated," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the conference of health ministers, told the "Bild am Sonntag".
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated is “not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccination stimulus,” Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised, "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Ministers of Health as early as next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I best do that?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases via my #PRS_ORG#.
Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping goes through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most often the hearing of sounds/voices, less often the seeing of images and most rarely the perception of pain.
For this topic relevant: C-sections are operations that are accompanied by an increased rate of awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the abdomen.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the pre-narcotic interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, though ** u/Nitemarex **per definition had none.
I read your comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the $20 will not help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if you can at least remove the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they are only delivering in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not being called?
I had asked a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatre critic and as a director.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I testify to my thanks for life here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are europallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected
New York wins MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC have won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had here a week ago a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash.
That was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I've come to the taste and want to cook roulada for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's the next step?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn’t that good anymore, but that’s what I’m getting.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
So far, the money has not been received by me.
Please check it out.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet?
Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can get another Christmas roast in the Lübeck room.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the degradation of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can be used to reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
Further up it already sounded that you can even float a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller, if it goes outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal applied here is processed with a boxing simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or when shooting directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate tuner.
If you donate an additional VFS5 foot button, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and "tape" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low for over a dining table?
I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it is not possible, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need is a bit much.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the provided hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it

Iran Sees Progress in Nuclear Deal Negotiations
According to Iran, the negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement are progressing.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Viennese talks on reviving the agreement were continued after almost a week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the 1,000 mark at the corona incident on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people suffering from Covid-19 were treated for intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is not until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and send it to the post office, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in here?
That’s what I want to avoid, that’s why I’m writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a recklessness.
It's time for change
####Bundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of Monday, you can see one thing: it is not ecstatic.
We got into a winter rigidity and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this is probably simply due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we are generally represented.
In the last few days, the impression has been shown more and more that many here are still really interested in the MBundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked who wants to keep it alive.
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply put, cluster of shards.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* What existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How will we look outward in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I forgot a lot, but that’s not bad, we’ll end up with discord.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large / clumsy for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: the blanket #PRS_ORG#, is there also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a guide for assembly?
How long do I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently she rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian for several years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
This is my decision to go vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that it was on her side of displeasure, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and you as a vegetarian reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to “plump” was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without which one would put it on.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# will not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date that #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my return on site.
Since I can’t be there due to a funeral, this can’t be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be meeting again all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz in the Lahnstein City Hall handed a grant note in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment trolley of the Volunteer Fire Brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this,” says Lahnstein’s Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a long-term expectation of increasing operations: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations but had synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for dealing with the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also arms bearers in the executive branch, further I do not want to talk about it!
The question of right and left is always very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
Of course, it is also clear that, even in the special uniform and weapons wearers, to attract people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality difficult. Of course, it is also clear, because you have, of course, besides the average white, now many Germans with a migrant background, women and also homosexuals (and by this I mean now I can not even put them on an exaggerated feminine note of the cliche than you, rather rather it in the people in doubt.
But these marginal groups also represent, even if it sounds strange to me for the first time, a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less caught up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to work for them or thinks they have to do it right, but they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but that they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans endangering the state is media completely exaggerated and annoys me too.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, often start to flat-out because of negative experiences, and sometimes things say that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that there are certainly right minded people who are engaged in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well fought against and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so entangled internationally and that is also good in my opinion that we couldn’t afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find only you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordinary by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am at work very disciplined and organized, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but already my life I get it more badly than right to run my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything stays, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really that “someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is also (unfortunately) not better, although it bothers me somewhere but most of the time, household simply loses to work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to become more orderly with a child?
We haven’t worked on it yet, and I’ve been busy with this question for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just does not bother me so much doll, as long as no visit comes and for example there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have completed training in the field of software development and have now been learning for about a year.
Unfortunately, I’m becoming more and more aware that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I’ve been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoidable) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means, roughly speaking, I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have loose conversations and I have been told more often that I am imprecise (which I think has already become better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family help.
But I don’t know if the actual working day is really the way I imagine it, and it’s difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("even the simplest things are screwed up") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how it works" / "I keep it mind with my stupid questions".
The problems I will probably have in any profession but I wanted to have mentioned it in the place.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for a pick-up date
What do you mean, please return?
If I downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# and she asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the food breaks down in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and builds up from these in turn its own proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The feather formation in nestling and the feather renewal in the moustering bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, otherwise there may be disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin supplement) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be reverted.

1 g of NEKTON organic to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One coated measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In the case of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be given at the beginning until the approach of feather regeneration is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is reached until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have this problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be felled.
Submit a request to the community.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and therefore also the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your responses
That's what we understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that, only the question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Emergency report: Severe traffic accident at Selb

As the press alert to the police is currently informing (14:03), a car has arrived in the opposite traffic when overtaking.
There are wounded.
Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is unfortunately moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking of everything you can think of.
Before I pick up here... in short: I need advice and best of all from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-starter.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t call anything more precise here).
The whole thing was too boring and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up with the Magisterium and I was sure it was - even if the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I've now arrived at the third "I Google other job vacancies".
And it's only been half a year.
During the paintings before that I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still swing.
But I'm absolutely done right now.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained.
Now it's a holiday, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration itself is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it’s fun and when viewed from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely drained and wondering how much stress my body is enduring before it gets completely dense – if it’s not already doing that.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should not go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take my free time when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, but was paid appropriately for it and together in a team what I have worked out now and not as the individual fighter.
But then I wonder if in a year I have not arrived at the same place as now and I am dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of messy, but maybe you have outside advice or ideas like how I get out of this situation, that I'm completely done and start crying at the slightest thought.
I’m not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas - that's enough for me to begin with.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the weeping undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been constantly evolving, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led again to a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find their way here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stroke, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that, above all, the power amplifier determines the tube character of an amplifier and based on this finding, they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic defeat series in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack naturally depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a snap-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) you can use the backpack for your gear and for things that aren’t for photos.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
The eruption of Tehuya Volcano in 1585 was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa at 84 days.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists continued to dare not predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state television channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava.
That’s almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Outside the coast, cold lava formed two new land tongues with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Particularly important for the island was the banana cultivation, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is near and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the celestial feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "society contract of natural peoples", can escape from the rigid routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Child of Christ
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the giver.
Previously, gifts were given in one way or another on Christmas Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women gold into their windows in one night to spare them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the custom popular in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they guard against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nicholas the child of Christ and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it annoys only the few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the Martin’s custom with Martinsingen and Martin’s movement.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift was shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyous cuddly muddle about the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christ Child appears on Holy Evening or Santa Claus, who is in principle a type of Nicholas, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white noise beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled pulled by reindeer, and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father's Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull their sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handover of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robbers near Royal Palace
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
The police said callers reported a man who allegedly went to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker’s business.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly thereafter by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was shot.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The luminaire is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spires.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting duration max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow color inside.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar luminaire shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic roundings fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It is also good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where it knows how to maintain itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself big preparatory work: As a solar luminaire, »Smart Stone<0xC2><0xAB> does not require any supply lines or batteries.
Place the »lightstone<0xC2><0xAB> in any place illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two supplied earth spires provide a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic case itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone<0xC2><0xAB> discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At dawn, »Smart Stone<0xC2><0xAB> starts to glow automatically; in which color you decide for yourself: You have the choice of six attractive light colours, in addition to daylight white.
The shutdown also takes place automatically as soon as the battery level has dropped to a preset minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I’ve done it several times, it doesn’t work.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to let this remain, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten pimples in my last roughly two-year break from 0 to 100 explosions and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it really put a lot of stress on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid it this time.
Perfume-free and without jewels my cosmetics is already, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
The doctor has not taken me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertural severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-area nodules and the acne topic.
Nutrition I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. illness and I stayed on sugar, milk and poor meat mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is simply the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere construction site you also prefer not to go looking for what else is wrong.
I already had everything from your colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work in between and on the phone and then suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

In the name of the people: laymen make judgments with
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge’s bench.
But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear robes: Schöffen determine with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.

110 kV ground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning decision of the Lower Bavarian government clears the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long ground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning near Reut to a mast of the overhead line.

Ref: Plan Classes (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy for free (which is annoying for geography).
It just takes me a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually stand for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest excessive time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence also the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can teach me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would love to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation about the Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains of sales declines.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retail trade.
In the case of businesses with items of non-daily demand, revenue declines are to be lamented, criticized HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
“What should actually be the positive highlight of the year is now often a groundless hole,” Genth said.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It runs well only in the food retail and online area.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
"2G in shopping does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer would only have to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all shops with the tape received on that day.
In addition, sample checks should suffice in retail - as already in public transport in the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping malls, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Lastly, without 2G, the frequencies were well over 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, while sales were around 90 percent.
These figures will now surely fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business," CEO Wilhelm Wellner told Wirtschaftswoche.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors, for example, can once provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also a defect that has been tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed and glued it back into the package.
What do I have to do for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted by a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The luminaire generates a very light flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiance angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It’s a great tool to work on either the movie set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the luminaire is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To make the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, simply by pressing longer one of the storage buttons is occupied and finished.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
Before the set, the DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two displays (the left battery display top, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously power the headlamp via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fastening, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted by means of locks on both sides.
Care has been taken that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that it also includes a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you might still want to buy.
I'm sorry I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after torreichem comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in a series of unsuccessful Hesse were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour, fired frustration over a full-blown start of the season from the soul and won furies with 5:2. "It's madness what the guys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and said a "packaged praise to everyone who was with it".
In the beginning, it looked like a new damper for the now in ninth position still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the Leverkusener 2-0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to get back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth match day and his overcoming muscle injury, stressed the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but is also well positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It’s top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now we want to "step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks "at this level" by the turn of the year.
Next Wednesday, in the course of the English week, a away game with Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 a.m., Sky) is on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
For me, it would mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women's dampers ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women sneaked off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and empty glances.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection took a hard defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers at 16:32 (8:13) and must now face hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too fearful and had too much respect for the opponent," said Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It is a pity that we were not able to take the flow.
It was a bad game for everyone that we have to eliminate,” said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight to enter the semi-finals, against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday, there must be a significant increase in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in a duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," backroom player Xenia Smits admitted and said: "We have to look forward quickly now."
From the front to the back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the height with the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 draw after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick setback.
However, the initial ignition hoped for was not.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly stage themselves - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game had run at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also still saw red.
In the quarter-finals, she is allowed to play again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection come a bit better into the game and until the break at least on five goals.
The already quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already after seven minutes at the 9:19.
Again, the Groener defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to rise to an increase in performance and left the parquet as a clear loser.

I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, some of them will then continue for me in vaccination centres.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they relate to one personally (e.g. "I am taking medication X, this is compatible with the vaccination.").
My responsibilities include vaccination education, indications (person is entitled to a corona vaccination and no reasons to oppose it), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (it has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical specialists.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake not lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but they can not perform vaccinations (may?), so that I also perform most vaccinations there.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has been caused for vigorous reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time remained discouraged by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who has to “get it all fast.”
That, people heard from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinates.
"The huidler," the spectators learned, "is a cloth with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialectic researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian Television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the rather well-known vernacular word "hoeder".
This closed an educational gap - probably also with some who have long lived in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice on the road bike - really so trouble-free?
This morning I woke up full of action, because I wanted to train at least a little to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and I drove with my road bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!)
Glass chips on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tyres didn’t want to take part in the rest of the track anymore.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around with a half-bad mood and take the first best train home.
It was also not so bad in terms of mood, maybe it is also better if I practice again before the bike tour with the change of tyres.
Now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would extremely dislike getting this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike 120km!) and who had already described this as suboptimal, because he rode with them mehere years on roll.
But if I think that I have to change my tyres after 80-90km, I think I’m really in a bad mood :D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unplateable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
Also, I wonder: I have at the moment on the road bike I think 25x622.
Although there are also (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on a road bike in general to other tires?
The Schwalbe site seems to be my absolute! Do you know more about the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car tosses against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had hit a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained cause and then hit the opposite lane, as the police said.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then thrown into a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would also get new offspring.
SOLO 15 is called the new offspring and visually reminds of the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a properly designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people where the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to a slight rise in tone.
This is generally common with broadbands in order to optimize the strongly increasing bundling at excessive frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-pitch range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamics that is similar to its search.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final look of the speaker in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again applies material.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate location in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without problems.
With the help of a top milling cutter, the speaker opening in the front follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
At the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Afterwards, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these are now glued the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in material thickness if required, if you want to use, for example, finished strips from the DIY market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall is made easier by means of a suitable circular hole saw or a forester drill.
Then you use a round milling cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (suction / blow out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and lets it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and let it also hang out loosely there.
Subsequently, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency switch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the attenuation according to the description.
Subsequently, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed tightly with the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the plus line (marked cable) has to be soldered at the plus pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> we can finally announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on a shift, so we’ll be watching the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to keep up with the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Get cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
