28-year-old chef found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall.
The victim’s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, “Finally it went uphill with him again.”
The body found Wednesday morning at Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco forensic department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as a murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had done his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and destroyed on the ground” by his death.
“We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him painfully,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO said.
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, prepare us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who was swimming with the stream.
“With everything going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that glowed brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD’s informative telephone number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
In an interview, the Hollywood star made this clear.
“I’m always stuck in drawers or get labels from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality.”
“I don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, these things are rather sniffy to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with loose duck and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
"We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," she said.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is no child's play", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is clear.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Goldene Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their evening, they hunted home in a fast gallop to the feeding troughs.
A mile at this pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And that ended the riding career again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.
He let his family guide him over the ALRV system, he didn’t even swing on a horse for photographic purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports help handed the man from Anhausen the Golden Sport Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Laubeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for athletic success, but also for social commitment."
Longer has been promoting young talent for decades.
And so he also handed over the prize money of 25,000 euros right away.
Together with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German sport" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the bob driver Meinhard Nimmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Wunderballe.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer distanced himself from the great animals.
Clinton and Trump: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement from TTP – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical, difference.
About the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be very different, Trump says.
He will massively roll back regulations, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged people and it needs money to do so.
That’s why taxes on the rich would be raised, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say the same thing.
The Democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the Republicans’ tea party wing.
Trump could still have party-internal discussions.
More obvious are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and boost coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program, calling for "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure – even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, Clinton said.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says that it should not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics deny him that this would only make the budget deficit even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton stands, who at least wants to demand that the rich pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers shelter.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is at most one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks with big eyes curiously into the room.
His mother stared at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all-refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not an exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” Bahr said.
“Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe,” she says.
For women, other reasons for fleeing predominate: "Many steal from it secretly because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriage, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives her.
On the run, this goes on.
“That smugglers, for example, demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever believes that this will end as soon as they arrive in Germany is mad, Bahr tells.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters were often considered inferior and at worst abused.
This means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children were certainly not born voluntarily."
Many women are so accustomed that they say nothing.
“Or they don’t dare to speak openly about what they have experienced because the shame is too great.”
Because they often don’t know how to help themselves, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr says.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Also in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, a press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodation exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: “It is very important that men and women be housed separately.”
“If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are housed together, violence against women can continue to occur.”
Especially the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible for women, says the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection, can be seen from the rush on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about us, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Demands for new measures to combat labour
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new measures to combat labour in their disputes over a new contract.
The British Medical Association’s (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire board to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently calm” about issues, leading to the treaty being rejected.
She said: “In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract altogether and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labour action that begins in early September.
The disputes led to six strikes this year, the first total failures in NHS history.
After the election, the head of the BMA Assistant Doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be forcibly introduced for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greets his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed slimy and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But Putin’s lasting coolness showed that Russia’s head of state hadn’t forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was infuriated.
Putin spoke out, accusing Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The offense was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unfettered attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to achieve some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup d’état.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed back.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West as it regards its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
In addition, there is the persistent resentment about the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is looking to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is self-evident for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent an “alliance of outsiders,” as one analyst once described to me: two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not even addressed the issue.
The president of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank’s CEO.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands in the spotlight.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralized headquarters and stock exchange listings will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the retail business that will become more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour by clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we now become more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to evolve into the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think we will see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK win at Newmarket on Friday.
He relied on Predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the jubilation as he takes the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been inspiring fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 wins if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month lockdown, but he showed impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's far from over - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he's at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fired chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust.
The 63-year-old was appointed as the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin ordered “the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration” without giving reasons.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin’s website states (in Russian) that he was later Chief of Protocol and Head of Staff of Government Staff.
On his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state with regard to bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This move has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which aired on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president wants to lead Russian environmental policy at once - came across a great deal of skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said “it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post – you could almost say – burdensome post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he most trusted.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term of Putin’s term would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical fight on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement his termination.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
On set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character from the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, is expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart into it for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandalfish that were spied out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blowers", which approach completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 inclined ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of engineering of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Altogether, almost 79% of all bridge decks are in place, and the last section of the deck in Rosyth today gets a concrete cast for the deck, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said, “The first lock represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road cover and its connection to the north tower deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an inclination of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are “lucky to be alive” after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded an alarm Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim safely while their boat moved on by its own power.
“We saw the boat revolving around them and imagined the worst,” said the head of Moelfre’s rescue station, Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already lifted the boat out of their reach until we let water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, “The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be uninjured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stopper, this detached itself from the person who steered the boat when the boat was entrenched.
Someone watched over these men today.
Seriously Injured - Man Strikes On His Ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured him.
Police said yesterday that the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to pick up his personal belongings.
Instead, the drunken perpetrator cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend’s clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
She couldn’t get him to leave the apartment.
That’s why she left the house with her companion.
On the street they met the man's ex-life partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig’s affordable apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be made much more obligatory in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes for the next council meeting a "concept of action living".
Dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?
So far, there is a lack of regulation.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, you have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in stock.
However, the big issue in the city hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as possible 20 percent of homes as social housing.”
A new urban housing development program, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is supposed to provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said, “At the moment there is no agreement between the factions.”
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tough conditions for investors.
Nonetheless, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is intensifying.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.
But the program is not yet complete: because the approximately 1,260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how does one compensate for the loss of another about 1,300 affordable apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?
By 2020, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring bonds should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price-binding.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved at once.
Because in the western city deadlines expire by the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price-binding for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners do not want this, the housing companies do not want it.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is increased drastically again, one distances oneself from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of the socially weak in only a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the group, said: "For a broad majority, the CDU has to get on board."
It has focused on more sites for single-family homes.
But that does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the couch and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I am referring to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest declined somewhat prior to the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Market launch in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones looking for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be “photographed” (by a screenshot on their phone) or “captured”.
A generation who played the game when they were younger joined the madness and jumped off the sofa for the search.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people tracked who work out for 30 minutes every day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want people to “take 30 minutes,” “come from the couch,” and “be active every day” have come across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the matter?
There was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity in the past, they didn’t give us a reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will fade with time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activation, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Brilliant on the whole.
And now, finally, Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-combat title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles from the United States turns on the floating beam during the women’s singles multi-fight final in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall, while cementing her reputation for being the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end in that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world champion medals — including 10 gold medals — with exercises so astonishing that include a mixture of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
She expected a final race in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the Spring, Texas family with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the women’s singles multi-fight finals in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted, during her long journey to the top, that she never planned the future, that’s not really true.
Part of her ground exercises — which include her typical tumbling pass — are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside Rio’s Olympic arena.
It's no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a multi-competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two spins, the picture deceived.
Floating beams and floor towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for her finale – a pure formality – and tears poured on Bile’s shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collective book came true.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time she fought for third place four years ago, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the fast-spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial killer case while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elli's daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in an driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, according to the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, predominantly in Hispanic residential areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, assuming it was the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
I didn't get involved in that.
What's not at all true -- of course, you've got it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund might never recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing it.
“My first response to that was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until he was 3 years old and he still can’t speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk and bike with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund devised for "Please sing something to me."
“We teach him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters by himself.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the forecast in a long time, because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Severe rainfall, flood causes rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, with more rain expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened extreme rainfall with large-scale flooding, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and were already on the way to help affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flooding vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the Tangipahoa municipality alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was in place on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas over the treacherous rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
“We woke up and the water flowed in and out,” Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread quickly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning reported 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the soil had been significantly crowded by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and failure to attend school in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Municipality chief Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuees.
“As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in the Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take away, hoping to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum of the city council.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but so far none have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "pierced by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot wounds, including in the lumbar, leg, arm, and stomach, but that he was aware of his transportation to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his small body was punctured by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether they may be among one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had been a crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridge shells for assault rifles, traced back to various assault rifles, sewed over the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow in her arm while playing outside her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine among the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly: this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin colours.
The structure of this team, which rounds off Aly Raisman, who is a Jew, and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
It shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympian and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the pinnacle of this sport, but that’s not how gym classes all over the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics is primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued as desired.
The majority of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started running.
We need to enable the communities, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to have more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my 20-year-old gymnastics foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide youth with high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, motivating her to get so many young girls from different backgrounds to start her journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Auxiliaries want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in a “no-man’s country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inconvenient times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Assistent physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly.”
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance in the government to participate and sometimes with deafening silence.
That came from a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the worries of the assistant doctors.”
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: “Arbitrary measures do nothing of the few, but burden already overloaded teams and service providers, and only cause patients, caregivers and their families worries, distress and interruption.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional break, training fees, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing education leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - would be a sign of how serious it was to employers, the Health Education England and the Health Ministry's November agreement with the BMA.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day drug after authorities have recommended administering it to more people for an extended period of time.
The clotting drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS’s NICE regulatory authority has recommended taking it for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS’s NICE regulatory authority has recommended taking it for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form linings.
When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
NICE’s draft guideline, released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one-quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years and the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Political Correctness Culture Brings Election Fraud to Blossom in Muslim Areas
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report over corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally assaults police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to “oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former minister of integration and local government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barriers outside election booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s fingers when casting their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.
“This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that comes with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way” and that he silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations.
Rahman is said to have “led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.”
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal election - where older members of the Muslim community have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to cleanse the electoral system, including holding IDs to prove identity.
“As evidence, it was appropriate that pressure was put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“There were concerns that ... state institutions knowingly ignored such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing ballot papers to stop “populars.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they’ve cast their voice to prevent someone from dialing twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on requests for automatic mail dialing.
Prohibiting political activists from editing complete postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
The police are empowered to set up barricades around polling stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates indictment for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling station alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after Tower Hamlet's case.
“The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unsuitable due to a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds of sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "off-checks" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
As the mother of parliaments, our country has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of election fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cyclist double and other famous doppelgängers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio were left out this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double by the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete this summer to feature her own famous doppelganger – at least not if you can trust social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians that have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since childhood to Leonardo DiCaprio
Aside from Kate’s doppelganger on the bike race track, many people on the internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
US archery team member Brady Ellison has caused an onslaught on Twitter after images appearing in which he looks eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got the insanity on social media and admitted that he has been hearing from childhood that he looks like Leo.
“I don’t see a big resemblance myself, except for facial hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a good-looking guy, so I’ll take that as a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come even more into the spotlight this year: the striking similarity between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
This user thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another lasting comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just sun-brown skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
One Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical.”
In fact, American football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the gymnast Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile that resembles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place at the 4x200m freestyle swim squad outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olmypian Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “did like Mief” and during the race like “a pig died.”
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squadron.
MacDonald, who had been brought into the CBS commentary team on board to give more "colour," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like mief, died like a pig.
Thank you. Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swim season 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to bridge the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, “Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’?”???
The idiot didn’t realize they were still on show.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m women's freestyle swim squad as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, with many calling him into question.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC program, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunately chosen phrase, we’re sorry it happened.”
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who responded to the comments via Twitter
Scott Russell apologized on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald’s comments.
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on broadcast and to our followers on social media last night.
To make one thing clear, Byron’s comments referred to the swimmer’s performance, not her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized to the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
“I’d like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swimming squad at the CBC Olympics,” he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry.”
Buyer in Primark outraged over woman trying underwear shamelessly in the middle of shop
Buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To exacerbate the situation, she sampled how she looked in it, pulled it out, and put it back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried on four pairs of underpants at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."
“Everyone stared as she took off the underpants that she obviously didn’t like as she put them back on the shelf.”
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like it, dressed up again and walked out.
“She didn’t seem to bother that she was watching — or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried on.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, “How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear that was wearing another person and that wasn’t washed.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “As I’ve seen, employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left — which is just as good.”
“I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was putting on them and taking them off again and not washing them.”
A spokesperson for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9th.”
All eligible products have been removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether they approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.
When approaching you from behind, you should turn around first so you can see your attacker and "get off the line," Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands as the attacker bends in pain, hit him with the run in the face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body off the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi makes it.
But remember that in a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright shaves his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and choking reflex – dumping some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shoved his move on a euro banknote, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flushing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before turning off each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will engage in.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the flushing button of a pull-up toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing buttons in toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.
In the film, he lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample smear showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valio’s Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch while explaining the benefits of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me put it this way – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where it was pretty difficult.
I’m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial Family Destroyed Before Deloging Social Housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An associative family left their social housing after a delogation with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked housing union employees found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floors were ripped open, trash was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family have been relocated and it is believed that they now live in a private accommodation.
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and police said the terror that had inflicted on the family included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an anti-social behavior order in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found
In the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn open
Neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly dismissed her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The delogization was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are unbelievable.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
On the overgrown side of the town hall, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: “It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delog is always the last step that Cornwall housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have come to us courageously and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogization
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear out mountains of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, plus <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 scales, paraphernalia and cash.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were graffiti-painted.
Police Say They Will Delogize Tenants Who Don't Follow House Rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the delogization was a clear warning to the other tenants who are not following house rules.
“This is for those who think they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft put down an incredible crash flight
The air force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: “It really flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added: “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was dropping on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that this was the only way to spot them.
The spokesperson said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that safety was not endangered at any time.
Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limited his visibility.
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans compete in a duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, the rematch increases three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must renounce Neymar, who is competing in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, among others, in the competition with the inferior Cup finalist and reigning European League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament swelling in his knee during training, which at least for the time being clarified the one question at Barca in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far waived a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications the lead.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test match of Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince at the 3:2 rehearsal against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has to digest the 2-3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
With this, the world leader won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final, as expected, and won the title with each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the singles title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic stage was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the grandstand and left their protectors alone in the fair competition.
"I have played the matches for my country so far."
“I’m playing for myself in the final,” Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma really had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
Afterwards, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang with only 13 points.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to "finally" settle with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourth in a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump Admits ‘Huge Problems’ in Election Campaign
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns of losing its majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally big-tracked and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something of a concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
“We have tremendous problems in Utah,” Trump said in front of evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in major states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blame false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media sneak peek.
Republican strongholds shake
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his Democratic competitor, Hillary Clinton, were on the same page.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just like I’ve done so far.”
“This will either be successful, or I will have a very, very, very long vacation.”
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it isn’t enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to cut funds in support of his election campaign, should he not be able to present better poll scores.
Instead, they want to take the Republicans’ congressional candidates more seriously.
Olympics: Cheating in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case.
Kenya's athlete is in danger of suffering after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After an attempted fraud during a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official said the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic Village.
This has been reported to the Kenyan team leader by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
“Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment,” the IAAF said in a statement.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it,” said Kenya’s Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s list of training controls.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich was fourth in the World Cup in Beijing over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed his country’s athletes about pending doping tests in exchange for money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping crimes.
In announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping target controls ahead of the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted in particular.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, accusations have repeatedly been raised that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that in this sport, doping has been systematically and comprehensive.
Russia's athletes were subsequently excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
Artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra trench the Simón Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he raves.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an elderly Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she’s smart, of course naïve, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, to my Italian character, which I have as a Roman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Driving is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join ISIS last year, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group’s stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good is that – as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone – to keep people from ever making this decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid Says Clinton Will Remain Candidate for Supreme Court in Case of Garland’s Victory
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since he was nominated by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a conference call Thursday that he expects Clinton to select Garland “with some certainty.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination as lackeys and aides to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys because “Playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar does too.
“We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
"If you don't adapt and praise Erdogan, you're sitting on packed suitcases," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-nahe Stiftung Dialog und Welt.
In the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", believes the association's chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect to see tens of thousands, in the medium term, of a few hundred thousand seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," Ali Toprak, chairman of the association, told the "World".
Because the government already covered Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey are on the run.
After the defeated coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It can’t be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitic cities.
In doing so, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds to leave.
“They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association called for the federal government to “position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters”.
A "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is also taking place in Germany.
For the first time in the last few months, I no longer feel safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition members.
The branding as a Gülen follower destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-nahe Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany even before the coup.
As of June 30, this was 11,386 people, and thus almost 29 per cent of all those recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled war, poverty or lack of perspective.
According to the Basic Law, asylum-seekers are exclusively politically, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer election contest - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they understood.
In 2021, the state elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it can't be more stupid than before: summer holidays, heat and the campaign for the country's parliament - this bites itself.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters, are on vacation.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes in the end are difficult to collect.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania must once again pass the election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It’s exciting how strong the newcomer AfD scores and what’s left in the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is conducting an almost inconspicuous campaign, one can see from his large-scale posters.
He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, as did his legendary puny predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the succession of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their “We can do this” has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the fine office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to take part in the right election campaign at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's Bundestag constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons there than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, CDU General Secretary in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.
But it doesn’t hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.
This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are roasting away the base in the country, that it must make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.
They are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: they hardly exist in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-exposing: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn the holiday not into a modern virtue and move their election campaign to the internet.
"Online election fight," state president Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners go in search of traces of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Elective holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty".
B27 Rehabilitation: Restaurants suffer from lockdown
The speed with which the B 27 is refurbished, there is nothing to worry about.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 in the morning and ends only around 8 pm, there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tricky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet petrol station.
This is a super team.
There is also no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, until the end of October everything should be finished.
It is also praised for the response of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of temporary entrances.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen again.
The traffic around the place seems to be falling back.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, deputy chief of staff responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise, because many were looking for trails and more trusted their navi than the signs.
As a result, some trucks ran into residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality demanded the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant overruns," says King, who once asked himself on the spot about the situation.
Two to three times a minute have already been blasted.
The fastest was in the Tempo 30 zone at 77 km/h.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don’t like to look at the cards.
But the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to sales droppings on them lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
If you have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, the renovation has hardly any consequences for you.
Also at the Maier Autohaus, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The most crowded are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already life-threatening.
Not only him, but all the restaurants had it "hard hit".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
The loss in sales is estimated to be “well over 50 percent”.
The road refurbishment has thrown back its operation "by two years".
Half of his employees were fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner as to whether there could be financial compensation, saying that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where this was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he points to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now come by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the refurbishment work is over.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction work on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being enforced.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, the German interior minister said at the presentation of his new security package.
They don’t overwhelm anyone.
Other, broader issues would initially be discussed within the parties.
I am also participating in this.
But as interior minister, he was interested in results and in an “achievable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also comes as no surprise.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second push for proposals that were not yet possible with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy for terrorist groups and jihadists with dual citizenship to cut off the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-man admits.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance anyway.
A few new ideas de Maizière also presents.
They have it partly in them: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before deportation.
Refugees who are brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of toleration for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem unyielding and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - in the case of the unequal treatment of patient people, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But there is no denying that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in the face of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that people were deeply occupied with could not be excluded even in campaign times.
Internal security has become a major focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election fights.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
In the last few days, there has been a great deal between the two parties.
First a horrible dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a collection of security-political ideas of some of the Union’s interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a ban on the burqa and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He does not think of a departure from the double passport.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it doesn’t make sense.
And in the case of a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be shown.
There's a lot in there that could cause some quarrel.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel signals a cautious willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
Volkswagen still gets through glimpses.
Despite the diesel scandals, the number of deliveries is increasing worldwide.
However, it is not in all markets.
In the recall action, there is a vortex around a term.
Volkswagen will start deliveries more moderately in the second half of the year.
Europe’s largest car manufacturer has continued to show a positive trend in the course of the year, despite the diesel business, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again strained overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second-largest market after China, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries sacked by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, some core markets have been subject to purchase restraint due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also strained, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a further downside.
A major support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand in Lower Saxony is still glaringly affected by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery decrease of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is in the works.
Head of Group Sales Fred Kappler was able to show a further increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, with 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling about 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issues customers a "equal guarantee" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
This is due to legal intricacies.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting took place.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW guarantees that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it has been called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "warranty", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop with an engine damage half a year after the conversion - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interest of the customer to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, leads to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
This is why VW does not use the term "warranty".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding fines from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Banking chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and does not see in it any signal: normal savers should not be afraid to pay for their savings penalty interest.
If banks store money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay it 0.4 percent penalty interest.
From September onwards, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will reimburse private and corporate customers for deposits of more than €100,000 in cash accounts or daily cash accounts.
“The first $100,000 is free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has kept for some time 40 million euros, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not use.
“They’re on my central bank account and they’re causing 0.4 percent of the cost,” the bank chief said.
"I can't spend 4,000 euros for every million."
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter pays principle.
To simply leave the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already seen four robberies, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank's chief.
Most clients had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few of them moved to other banks.
The Bavarian cooperative association said: “The ECB’s extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs for all banks.”
“Wearing them alone is not possible in the long term, economically.”
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made headlines with its Skatbank branch in 2014 with penalty rates for deposits of more than three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: “We do not expect private customers to have to pay fees for deposits across the board, as competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong.”
One banker said there was "a clientele at Lake Tegernsee that was a little more lavishly equipped with the assets."
"This can be a problem for a small bank" if it keeps money for free.
Founded in 1911, the cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
"There are currently no other banks known to the Bavarian cooperative association that charge a compensation for deposits from private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is tough, and it threatens the emigration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in the widest possible way.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it with harsh insults under the pseudonym Not All Lonely MenMiddleAge, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and wildly gestulate before I stand still, hold my hands and say something defining like, “So let’s take a closer look at it.”
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though Soho’s heart is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings once home to independent vendors – there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would presumably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I guess so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a little too young to buy from,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who have heard about the comeback and have been prompted to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations that I have had, people have usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
That would explain the boom in supporters of record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, items that awaken happy youth memories.
“I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation,” says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to get involved mentally.
“We’re like their social workers!” an employee flew from a pile of plates.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don’t own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works on Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, 'I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roaring from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging mental traumas are difficult to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes and looking at the variety of the plates for sale.
She does a shop window walk rather than a major purchase.
She doesn’t earn much, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in some other way, but the beauty of records is..." she expels with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to sample the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter consider buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just purely decorative, some so high that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the deep Sohos for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research has shown that YouGov’s results are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and scrolling through records, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, 30-year-old fake presenter who peers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects offer on demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional businesses in which people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which carries a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They further stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were “absolutely understandable.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which is a non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure “would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old.”
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to date - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in Olympic time trials, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be underwhelmed.
"I will continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place at the Sugarloaf.
“I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday’s time trial,” Martin said.
He must calmly analyze the reasons that led to the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to compete for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed lately.”
"My position also counts," wrote the three-time world champion, who lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
Olympia: Tennis pro wins and misses semi-final
Laura Siegemund’s victory process ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The 32nd world rankings from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to make her hit once and seemed powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German tennis pro to win a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the summer games had last been there in 1992.
A German duo has never been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game transmissions
Watching other people while playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it, too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the takeover, Microsoft did not say on Thursday.
Beam launched its offering in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face off against enemies, as well as provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of esports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the startup, which is so far headquartered in Seattle, Washington, are moving to Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
Accordingly, nothing should change for the customers through the takeover.
Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 – for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s mother alphabet.
Here's the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s raser has to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which are intended to transfer speedometers particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking enforcement trailers from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident focal points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or bridges to be refurbished with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be detected simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as passage bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer with any car with a trailer clutch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also fireproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: Recently, France has reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK takes silver in 7-time rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7-time rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, backing, line running and raw strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal – Britain’s fourth on that day – and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' significant defeat, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form in this form.
It could be a consolation for Britain – but it probably won’t – that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult road ahead.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They only lost one here.
This slap will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started off wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs bounce off of fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., it felt like you were running in buses, the World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau overrated in the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuwai made another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A superb tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play time...in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes at halftime and closed the Fiji gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interlude from Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been going for a long time in favor of the South Seas, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the grandstand.
It wasn’t hard to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-top with another try in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked crushingly slapped into the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown led the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle from Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning Inspired by Fighting with Coach's Cancer to Rudder Victory
There will be no more emotinous gold than these games and that’s what it means.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hikes going down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were sitting on the rudder, there were three votes in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the doubles without a driver in a row, the first women in the history of the British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th undefeated mission, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rudder is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital running around the station — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went on Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It’s been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a huge thank you goes to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wanted a better coach or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t looking to do anything great.
We didn’t want any fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” she said.
For 31 years, exemplified clarity
The Managing Director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered to be "Bayernweit exemplarisch".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This is what was said some time ago in the original tone in a contribution by Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the water forum honored the government of Lower Franconia.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "example throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who worked for the purpose association for 31 years, including 28 years as managing director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, provides about 150,000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairwoman, the Mayor of Breitbrunn, Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed as Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.
“His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipe construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency weekend operations,” she said.
As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the rehabilitation of the high reservoirs (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the refurbishment of water pipes.
There has been no stoppage at all and innovations have been added over and over again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.
He has dedicated himself with a lot of heart to his Water Purpose Association and he has lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was able to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for that.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water keeper, and he was a faithful bartender.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult task, however, was the pipe breakage at the high container at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will succeed Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly addresses the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
“Medicine has made great strides,” the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
“If I ask him something two years ago when I sang at the Scala in Milan, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship status in Bargteheide - man shoots at life partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his life partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after which he is publicly searched.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brownish and has a baldness.
In the meantime, the police have published a photo of him.
It is, however, a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a baldness.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a “relationship”.
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the course of action or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
“This is a murder crime.”
“We are not saying more at the moment,” said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Light Vision for the German Steel Industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of additional costs.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity promotion are off the table.
It will remain with the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge for the existing plants for so-called in-house electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
“I’m really happy that we finally managed to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to pay for the use of gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry faced additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent apply.
However, this is not the case in the steel industry either.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on own-power generation.
This largely establishes the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts for the steel industry are of particular importance.
“In terms of our ‘steel is the future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
"Further must follow."
"The reform of emissions trading must also weigh climate and employment targets," explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The European steel industry has been suffering from overcapacity and price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened as the world’s largest producer country, China, threw massive amounts of steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel have shown an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have become clearer.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices had stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp recently did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year’s level.
The association expects to see an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing is Good for Seniors
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Magisterium she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me – emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive overall, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.
Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.
Through regular meetings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often disintegrate with age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also made this experience in her choir: "To discuss and organize oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the blow even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on the elderly, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Community of Seniors’ Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, demented people themselves reminisce about long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focusing on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm while adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get from singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are good reasons to start singing, so there are enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir, you can turn directly to the church or the head of the church.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help searching for the Internet.
Anyone who likes to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to cries of juveniles
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of the call of cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the miau did not leave the males cold - but they always behaved the same, unlike the females.
Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babies on the miae of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens that seem to be in great distress, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"It appears that the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and highly excited juveniles are either not noticeable or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the MHH animal husbandry were observed.
On the one hand, they were played by shouts of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more aroused kittens, which were raised in addition.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who had no offspring of their own, responded differentiatedly to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when it played out the calls of the more excited kittens.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males responded at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski hits Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the battle of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is required.
Already in the imposition of the state of emergency after the attempted overthrow in July, the government affirmed that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping before football.
The Prosecutor's Office issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact it has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy guards” in public squares across the country, Erdogan declared ended on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the workers’ club Besiktas are not traditionally friends of the president.
But what most Turks unite in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans are in agreement - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the cup winner "Gala" it will arrive especially again on Lukas Podolski.
The Kölner proved his sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the square."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round K.o in the Champions League, the "lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it reached only sixth place.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besikta, the year of the game went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season goals as Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also why fans continue to look forward to the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was signed to AC Florence and was only loaned to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return to the country after his EM holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the Kicker magazine quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
But the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletic sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for medals.
The topic of doping continues to drive the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Julia Jefimova, who had claimed her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 meters chest).
There was a bizarre scenery: with a smile on her face, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she would not get gold, the audience broke out in a jubilant storm.
But there are still many other athletes who, despite the doping past, are going to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was previously suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion is running even faster than before, he is over 100 meters in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month ban in 2010 after being proven to take the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, World Champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking it and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-squadron/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world so far.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): So many medals were subsequently dismissed by hardly any athlete.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after testosterone doping was detected.
The 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship for testosterone abuse.
He was awarded the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, which was also disqualified, on the basis of a decision of the International Sports Court CAS.
With 80.04 m, he is second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favorite was tested positive only in May, but still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion has found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA’s ban fell mild and expired as early as July 13.
Bombing in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again.
She planned her trip home in early September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in an outing district on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday, two explosives were raised again, killing another person according to the authorities.
Also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the early morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, according to police.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the coastal police area.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
It is believed that there was a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
“The bombings carry the same handwriting,” Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters early Friday.
“We believe this is a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to comment on possible motives, but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency or international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
Over the past few days, the authorities have received intelligence reports of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to increase security around key government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used for years by Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High security risk (Security Level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surrounding areas.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, unnecessary trips to these provinces are discouraged.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military a great deal of influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos as the country moves toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unit, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody riots, is claiming to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to cope with the Muslim rebel uprising that has been raging for years in the far south of the country.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
According to several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' hints for aspirations against the liberal democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the constitutional protection of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now observing the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes “multikulti madness”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and the “loss of one’s identity through exaggeration”.
Protectors of the constitution in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the state offices.
“Groups like the ‘Identitarian Movement’ are trying to pick up their target audience where they are,” he said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do.
This is not an advertisement for your own cause.
Propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point onwards.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target by certain people who are extremist and becomes extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there may be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming, which are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that there were many attacks on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right-wing scene.
“Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent, or who have elected, for example, the CDU, SPD or the left, but who have then radicalized themselves through a right-wing extremist mood.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
It is not always the Olympics or world records that determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
On social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a 48-second lag and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was granted a special starting right by the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media have called him the "Robel of the Whales".
Reminiscent of a "prosperity belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only struck with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a lead over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Frenetic, Moussambani was fired at at that time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop at around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn’t see the election defeat so close
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
If the election to the U.S. president is not going to happen, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll just go on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the U.S. presidential election in November, he wouldn’t care: “Ultimately, it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation,” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CNBC.
If it isn’t enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that’s fine, Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terror militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance has been forming.
Post enters the trade of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post also plans to sell its StreetScooter electric vehicle.
The company plans to start trading with the transporter shortly.
The Post intends to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into selling to third parties," a postal spokesperson said Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
Postal board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group intends to enter mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In post-owned manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group intends to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and plan a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
“We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're moving the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s streets since 2014.
GfK-Führung resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is exchanging its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes all the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised are lacking.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the management, the global number five of the industry is facing a new start.
The CEO of GfK wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already retiring from the supervisory board with effect from 12 September.
As of September 1, Gerhard Hausruckinger, former member of the Board of Management, will take over the management board, the company said.
He is supposed to officially take over the function of a "speaker of the board" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignation, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A spokesperson for the company did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently unclear.
Investors said on Friday that shareholders had recently been disappointed by the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after five years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will be uneasy at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do that," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarter, the company had not been able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, revenue was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior-year quarter.
Relative to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter have mainly affected the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of company values of EUR 139 million, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit, resulted in a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In a bus accident involving 43 senior citizens, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn, in the district of Aurich.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to evade an accommodating vice, which partly drove on the opposite lane.
The bus got off to the right of the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokeswoman for the police of Aurich/Wittmund reported.
“Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently,” she said.
The fire department freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency medical car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back by a bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators asked the driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are 3.44 euros for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl wastewater treatment plant instead of 2.10 euros so far; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (so far 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After a superfluous calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the county office in Kulmbach found that there are undercovers for these sewage systems.
The Kasendorf market was obliged, on legal grounds, to operate the plants cost-effectively.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse.
Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As the managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverages from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt explained that the three wastewater installations were relatively small, with a very low wastewater discharge, which ranged from 6800 to 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, costs for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the amount of sewage in all three plants decreased slightly.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, significant refurbishment and repair costs were incurred for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater treatment plant due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, the first sewage pond had to be excavated after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continued care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small sewage incident in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "full punch".
In addition, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared large maintenance costs in the wastewater systems over the past 20 years.
Steinhäuser believes that the situation for the above-mentioned installations will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended by these installations because they are deficient installations.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The average annual inflation for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed compared to the previous month for the following categories of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2 %); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5 %); health (0.1 %).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; as well as education.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it’s insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blatant, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps are made public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting blackface or promoting white skin as an ideal of beauty.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and stuffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely circulated about the photos, wrote that the filter was "harmful and, to say the least, unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company crossing this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be embroiled in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people — who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts — might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, “so it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than it used to be,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, urging others to do the same.
In an essay for mediums and in a phone interview, she said she believes race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“Either they don’t have diverse representations of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with other skin colors working there but aren’t in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say anything about it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss its employees’ cultural backgrounds, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a HR manager who focuses on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said she will shut down her Snapchat account, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership misrepresents ISIS intelligence, Congressional committee notes
U.S. Central Command military personnel changed intelligence information to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional committee of inquiry said in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, compiled by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, or Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence information, typically sniffed out by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than analysis by other intelligence services,” the report said.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership mistakes in Centcom reach to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.
Although it does not provide direct evidence that Obama administration leaders have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than they corresponded to the facts,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom family member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the Task Force after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of Islamic State reports.
The report released on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Department of Defense Inspector General are underway.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the Republican Task Force’s conclusions.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said senior Democrat on the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, “delayed the release of intelligence reports,” damaged morale among analysts, and “gave excessively little room for differing opinions.”
But Mr Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of a White House intervention by Centcom analysts regarding a “definite political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which were filed after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general’s investigation was still underway.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent views on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful US-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of Defense Department officials).
But last year’s accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence is reminiscent of conflicts more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then-government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, envisioned only a small occupation force in Iraq and little time spent thinking about the aftermath of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker’s team, according to government agencies, noted that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against the Islamic State-owned refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these temporary refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding has not been published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced in the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, showdown with UK imminent
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the American women’s field hockey team in a Thursday match against India that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I am not one of the people who keeps their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the first place in their group with the British, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The first-placed will go a little longer out of the way of the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the game may end on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
Growing up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, she had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team’s history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and as a result, things began to turn for the better.
“A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to completely tear the rudder around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a handshake from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.
She made a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and pushed the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a raging race between competition and aspirations.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning staff, which is handed from the crossbow shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is attending the Olympics for the first time and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been under these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, some in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I may humbly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so scarcely for the last 16 years that many of those I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the US sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumping board."
Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air, and have to do a series of falling movements (turns, pikes, and jumps) before landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated by execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal-seekers need to move on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another ridiculous goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
Targeted striving is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it’s enough to even stir a viewer to tears.
But it’s also what I feel is a bit tiring even when watching these games.
Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Again, there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaulting in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2pm.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved by the angaffing and objectification of male athletes – as suggested by the U.S. male turners according to The Wall Street Journal recently – then Mr. Dooley expects his air-fighting new fan base.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have come across violent government resistance.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in exchanges of fire.
Is Ethiopia collapsing?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government’s response was merciless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Watching videos of the protests, presumably from last year or earlier this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia, with few countries in Africa, if any, receiving so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have consistently led government oppression – opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were exiled or imprisoned, killed or driven into the wilderness.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options but to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth is protesting.
One generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to choking grip in terms of the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a fight over this razor-sharp, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of simmering beneath the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who came from predominantly Christian highlands in Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that too is changing right now.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up around 6 percent of the population, and who are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed disease in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to work on opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this basic skill,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uprising was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that analysts said appeared to have been foiled by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, though fewer than in recent months, and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal resentment.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked shops run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump Says Obama Founded ISIS as ‘Sarcasm’
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, saying his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terror group had not been seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also puts his comrades, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant.
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back on the claim on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early-morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he was completely serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is buzzing down on Mr. Trump as he tries to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling poll values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Of course I meant it sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to ‘clear up’ depending on how the reaction turns out,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken an even more corrosive tone as his poll values have continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he is increasingly in the spotlight in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s joke has put his loyal comrades in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, took great pains to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I think what he says is legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said, so he was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on every one of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the “poor, miserable” TV experts trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.
Once pushed off the market over price, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay for cash, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is change, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excepted, and Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is change, then it is reinvention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who owns and manages the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outlet, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
“I came quarterly after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they’re preparing my everything bagle with butter,” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he replaces his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment that the soap business had taken over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special verb soap with the coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we will still respond to their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to bottle and sell the cold brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the venue and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a fondness for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as P<0xC3><0xA2>te de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and a plum pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" dealt with Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Brickman's book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will be published Tuesday at Harper Publishing, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, casual snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with pieces of olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression.
“Rich foods were very popular,” said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were made from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve you as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" charts the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the sleazy land.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe said of why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as breads and rolls of cash became staples, the roll of cash as a "wonderful way to recycle leftovers of food," noted Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unsavoury ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the focus of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunchtime," Coe says.
Brickman continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical for many household recipes.
As never before or since, household economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943—drive the country’s eating habits in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “household politicians” and to live up to the challenge of turning pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historical delicacies.
In particular, the reports of the government’s response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s Let Me Cake-Eating attitude, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
“He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleakly prepared.
Many of the Great Depression-era ways of dealing with food were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Brickman said, as well as how science has been applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they had better understood the eating habits of Brickman’s mother-in-law—for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Brickman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates at Eisenberg's were cleared, she and Coe drew a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called prune whip,” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a fancy name for modest recipes.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown gibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a lookout three times.
Like a can-do budgetier, he told his wife, “A few chopped walnuts would help.”
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that has so far saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guard showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture: "For me this is the real jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees in me a martyr.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
A woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
“We are now removing the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children don’t play with it,” the image quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation aboard the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark slowly swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of 1,220 meters in an hour.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.
However, this lifestyle marked by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Madness", comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are becoming rocky.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sheets off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know accordingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks still make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patroll at the bottom of the ice sheet and look for corpses that tumble down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues have now investigated 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters long.
To determine the age of the animals, they used the carbon-14 method to analyze the lens cores of the sharks.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third-smallest animal at 220 centimeters in length, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday when it was investigated in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark was 335 years old, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter-shark might even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland sharks only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the 392-centimeter animals was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously allow at least one and a half centuries with breeding.
This is also expected to be a world record for vertebrates.
That such methusalems live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record-holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a flame of austerity.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals also often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in a double pack
At the recent meeting, the town council focused on building issues.
With relief, the committee took up the message from Mayor Robert Putz that "finally the marketing of the newly designated residential areas can begin".
After the land, parceling and development issues had been clarified and the applications for surveying had been made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer impeded.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and aspiring seniors alike.
As it was said, volunteers can now report to the town hall, on the allocation of the parcels, the municipal council is expected to consult in its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the newly prepared land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the area of subtemporal larvae, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels in the direction of State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets division.
After the Brexit referendum, it is unclear whether financial institutions can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far only had the right to be admitted to the UK.
This is what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, speaks the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the Risk Board ESRB.
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks because it allows them to communicate directly with the supervisory authority,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector, it is worse off in infrastructure than Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the management consultancy Mercer, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg in 19th place, Dublin in 33rd place and Paris in 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
However, despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, say the economic researchers.
In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred in the Hepatitis C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was cleared of $200 million in damages for the violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct by Merck, including the Meineid and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to a waiver of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to match Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work that underpinned sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are combing through the city after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
“The city is now in complete control, but we are doing clean-up work right now,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn $10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, yielding an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million to charities, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in redeeming fees; the former Secretary of State reported an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency,” Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and pullbacks regarding his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the train,” Clinton’s campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax audits are complete.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already rushed to the topic and posted a video on the internet on Friday calling for high-ranking Republicans Trump to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s for two years, and a New York Times business journalist on Friday cited a number of tax attorneys and tax advisors who said that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton backs a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure people earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to taxation by the IRS and Trump was “afraid” of voters rather than tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has published a tax return dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return showed that they only earned $100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.
Her main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton’s dividends and income of $109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms filled with chili powder on them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea for it years ago, has intensified its promotion, along with U.S. conservation, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvest without harming animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitudes within these communities, much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming the elephant,” Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks in a condom, the end of which is turned towards the ignition cord.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust of chili powder into the air.
A hint quite usually already out to chase the elephant.
A final possibility is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk construction on the St. Goarer Rhine bank
Normally, St. Goar’s investment projects are embraced by traders with a kissing hand – but retail in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the City Council unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU-Fraction.
Jewish director smashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli area code has been removed at "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uprising after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli area code because it “asked” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and eradicated?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel clerk said the move was a “intentional decision by Kempinski Hotel management.”
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the area code be deleted," Lanzmann said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called this a “great disgrace,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater shame.
That doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to “make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some contended that the Kempinski Hotel had "indulged" in the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Ashame," it said in another post, noting that the hotel, which is located on the noble Elector's Dam, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "incident" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There has never been a direct instruction to not include Israel on the quick dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police Use Tear Gas & Rubber Shots Against Protesting Brazilian Students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional President Michel Temer on the walls.
The latest protests came a few days after mass protesters took to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed by a Senate vote to remove her from office.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have been keenly interested in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are entering into existing ties with Iran as new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom has been achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that last year’s record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
“I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market raided in Waldbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the guise of a gun, three darkly dressed people, who had concealed their faces, demanded from the employee of the drinks market the issuance of cash and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW golf.
How much money was stolen, the police do not tell.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and have fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the car park entrance, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladerring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the attack (at around 7:45 p.m.) that are related to the robbery should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: Game and fun during summer free time
The children and young people of the social pedagogical group / social group work of the children’s protection association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their caregivers in their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
During the first week of school holidays, the joyful group was housed in the quietly located leisure home Hardtwäldle.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special guided tour of children in the world famous monastery.
The third excursion led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invites you to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and caregivers were pampered with their own prepared body dishes such as the Sauer Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewels were made from pearls and stones, or a Roman-mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home contented.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome for all the ministers in probably two years, the Superior Ministers’ Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally a decision was made for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the door of Mercy at the Freiburg Münster, which was opened for this purpose.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and the holy rooms set out.
The evening before, Pastor Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau and thus the pilgrimage route was started from Münster.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis at field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly took a break to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the overnight stays, parishes of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and invigorating dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day we started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to descend in muggy heat at first about 500 meters of altitude and then climb again.
The deserved reward was in the evening a common barbecue at the badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage in Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked.
In the evening Mass in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we took the train back to Horb.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotland’s Callum Skinner storms home as Briton wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men’s team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role of his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a win from New Zealand's favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place at the London World Rail Championships in March despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when hinds appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made a big part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed the pedestal.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell to the track.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such a great victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the UK flags on the grandstand."
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expects us successful five days in the velodrome.
With the form of Kenny's, it is possible that he repeats Hoys' victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Roger Bannister were also born) – a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny will participate next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this just for the moment.”
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal contest of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They reached the finish line in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be in the focus.
He had argued with officials before qualifying yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong track bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and collect a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas played out in the background, including the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of big names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, looking at the first evening of the competition in velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smelter questioned due to repeal of energy contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum melting in Victoria – as well as hundreds of jobs for workers – is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract, thereby canceling all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This move followed the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs – both direct and indirect – could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total power generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and ultimately due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said in a statement.
AGL further stated that the contracts are so-called “securities” that should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," the power supplier said.
All potential impacts on revenues on AGL from YY18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing amount of $187 million in “expectation of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts, the "ability of Alcoa to operate the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the smelting" did not interfere.
The company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have come into force from November this year, even if it still owes a statement as to why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to poor economic conditions in the industry.
Referring to the analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago consumes about 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as electricity producers,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador who ran the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the issues of Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-time most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), all of whom forgot the cover.
This is the clichéd action of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest used the phrase, "You thought we forgot you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have beaten her when it comes to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a scope that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista, there were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the Walzer).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the crap of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the misery seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is, in the truest sense of the word, a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises her primer from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on Reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need of assistance are dismissed annually by community law centres, while the industry is focused on the impact of further cuts in funding on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly older people, immigrants, workers in need, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to unjustly delogize and the like – are already denied free legal advice and legal aid when they apply.
Legal services of the community, which are already over-utilized, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Director of Queesland’s community rights centres James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Rights Centres found that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are being turned away from important services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with uncontrollable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly fired – all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities, as well as the fact that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign indicted after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been indicted for alleged inaction after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina directed a gun at an employee in February while they were in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte’s state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that “that would not happen.”
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right index finger on the pull-off, and rammed the run into Vincent's knee throat," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment People” – gun owners and gun friends – should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and appointed judges.
Trump’s campaign made clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint claims damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent emotional damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, could not be reached for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The proceeding is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll ahead of country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was revealed by representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the poll values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances of continuing to serve as the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party was only just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the state parliament with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are back in the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
The NPD and the FDP would not be represented in the state parliament at 3%.
According to the poll, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin general election (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU only reached 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and the Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn’t fit well in your hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would suffice for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the format of western pockets".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was the Communicator to be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was 392 euros.
No one could have predicted in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has changed.
The smart phones are a success story, albeit not for Nokia.
The Finnish cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by vendors, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is everyday life for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million.
The worldwide turnover of the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough in the mass market only came in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple’s victory has begun, and the iPhone is still the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had to look after it.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung have the say.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
Today, on average, every German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put the smartphone away,” said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel at Siemens’ board of directors.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and to all of London, but to all of the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages to Stratford and the East End.
And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow’s expansion is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be embarrassed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in academic growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow who have implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 – which has been voted the world’s best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, backed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will also be one.
It’s time to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its desktop page would change the coding of its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth battle between the ad-blocking open source community and those around it has been going on since the invention of ad-blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, according to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use ad blockers; almost four times as many as 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook through their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs as mobile ad blockers have no impact on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes up a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its “advertising preferences tool” to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters would be worrisome because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a blunt means, which is why we’ve instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman driving over on Swiss motorway in suspected suicide
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit in the early hours of Thursday morning in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and was hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, prompting them and any witnesses to the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
That’s something the prosecutor has to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases – in which a person ran in the dark on the highway – it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks on the highway in the middle of the night, according to the newspaper.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who lay on the A1 road near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dense atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, but still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to harbor life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those on Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Avalanche Coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, leading to too little co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Colorados alternate president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have been fulfilling my duties as Colorado Avalanche Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking a lot and a lot over the course of the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, what it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determine decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today of this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the offseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the game for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two plays with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike
Labor struggles over salaries for North Sea oil workers are being suspended as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group have been carried out sporadically on North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group, as well as Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” the statement said.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year to re-address the problems.
The unions said their latest strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has fired thousands of people and announced plans to quit its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its business as a result of its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude prices, an economic situation that had been intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades star cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotational periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
You're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars eject large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Because the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about which we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleiades’ rotation rates, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A Controversial Baseball Star Resigns
Alex Rodriguez’s tears ran faster than the U.S. baseball star on best days from base to base.
Following his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time all-star Major League Baseball (MLB) player.
Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, winning the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a 10-year contract has given him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he has achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance off the court.
Back in 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN that he had consumed banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is believed to have been the main suspect of receiving performance-enhancing drugs through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the suspension was reduced to 162 matches.
"The league could have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said.
Even his farewell days don’t go quietly.
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
“My job doesn’t include a farewell tour.”
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have had a relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from fans from Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A female athlete would have won almost one medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically watched athletic competitions, this news comes at a time.
Chen had already been detected last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B-sample and hold a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio leaked the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is also expected to have already failed positively.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-affected nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also announced, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, in particular the case of Danekowa is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Federation IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from starting, with one exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan runners also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
Sun Yang pinkelt purple.
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese Championships, but only had to sit a three-month ban.
Data theft: How perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with extortion software at least once in the past twelve months, in some cases several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators to be able to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks on corporate networks, according to malware bytes.
If they succeed there, the potential ransom to be blackmailed is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Initially, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks took place frighteningly quickly in the past few months.
Ransomware works by a simple pattern: once active on a victim’s computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
Subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmailers.
To get the final encryption code to the files, victims must transfer money – usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of a downtime in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: “A single person can write a ransomware in about a week.”
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Perhaps the criminals then hire spammers to spread it," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that are better at securing their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on file backups and scanner software to defend against ransomware.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If encrypting data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators threaten to release sensitive data, such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, chief executive of Malwarebytes.
This means that the potential for damage is even higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory in the future instead of heating, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be quite flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, seems rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the rear.
The materials of the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit top is a bit off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.
Not only is there a trunk of 453 l for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the backseat can be folded up like a cinema armchair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-litre diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
But he should do his job a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a bit more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (working up to speed 32), the Collision Warning System and the Lane Keeping Assist.
The Collision Warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when maneuvering.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent cruise control responds to traffic sign recognition and reduces speed when needed.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel is fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For a liability is conceivable only in the case of hazards that are typical for air transport, argued the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay damages to the man.
Illness: When the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have been shown to have the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was severely ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their vacation in Turkey.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The holidaymakers attributed their illness to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family thought the trip was flawed – and sued the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was fine.
He therefore did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially since no contaminants were found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion with each other - is a general risk of life.
Out of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
At the same time, the state must be prudent and resolute in responding to terrorist threats.
Certainly, our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not allow this victory to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also increase the population’s approval for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces, “in the middle four-digit order over several years.”
Advertising sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is to be novelized in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made difficult.
The last much discussed obligation to remain silent for doctors should be respected according to de Maizières words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said, with a view to mental abnormalities, for example.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covert investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a slap in the ear for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the Funke Mediengruppe newspapers (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic.
You cannot forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burqa.
One can talk about rules, for example, on the road or for witnesses in court.
Greens chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate action and action with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Bernd Riexinger, leader of the Left Party, said: “Flotte proverbs and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country.”
Improved traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It gets stuck regularly on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the right turn should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they travel via the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16-17) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit the right-hand turn-off lane will be extended by 700 meters.
Drivers can then thread directly from the hammer road to the right.
The big advantage: traffic splits up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the roadway on the feeder annoys motorists especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backlog extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes even beyond.
The reason is the eye of a needle on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is only steered one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled about three-and-a-half years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing power to accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this bottleneck and the associated work traffic jam will last, the responsible national company cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual service life until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand turn-off lane, the state company has consciously chosen the less frequent time in the school holidays, because disability is to be expected.
Traffic will be passed by the construction site in one lane on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "Das invisible Haus".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "Das invisible Haus" of the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the staging in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which aims at the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of the action, according to the press release of the Jungen Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people between the ages of 14 and 20 with and without a refugee and migrant background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language exchange are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of falling stars: hope for improvement of the weather
The weather has made the star-shoot-watchers in the southwest of Germany a stroke through the bill at night on Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been poorly suited for observing the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is for Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will surely see many star falls in the sky.
The star sheds are Perseids, which are among the fastest falling stars at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep before the alarm clock.
This is anything but restful.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel that their sleep is often or permanently ineffective.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be rooted in many different causes, says Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of directors of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a sleep-through disorder.
In particular, many people feel that sleeping through is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the German Association of Household Physicians with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There may be organic, psychological or behavioral factors behind it, as well as medications.
Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
“Very early awakening is common especially with depression,” says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you may lie ill, wake up every two to three hours and perhaps start to ponder everyday problems and worries.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired in the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: You are tired, tired, unsleeping, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any established sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have sleep problems, you should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.
This can be done by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in case of snoring with breathlessness, in case of morbid daytime fatigue, in case of sleep changers or if the cause of a sleep-through disorder is not found, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep at noon," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears nose glasses, a chest strap and a probe on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected manage the problems?
There are quite a lot of set screws that you can set up for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleeping and waking times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and this is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the World Short Track Championships in Doha, setting his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has faced protection via Facebook from his criticized ex-teammates.
“In a country where an Olympic winner receives a prize of €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at doping or even do it.
"I'm not saying that controls should be stopped here," he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is the same with countries.
"If you cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain period of time before the World Cup/OS, you cannot participate," says the Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 were arrested.
The suspects had committed several baggage and baggage thefts as gangs.
At about 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to police officers from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several offenses since mid-July this year, proceeding collaboratively, part-of-work and particularly professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had taken more than 15,000 euros in total.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, a rest of cobblestones in between: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police count it among the "Dangerous Places" of the city.
Walking along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
On the facade of a grey house someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferably illustrated in recent weeks with burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin’s interior senator, Henkel, in particular, had repeatedly spoken out for a harsh police action against the project, calling the area a “no-go zone” for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the ground-floor rooms, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police, according to official statements, patrolled for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a kiez, which for the most part sought police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The ditch that the Berlin Senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still today has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the resulting residential projects have also long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainz had been cleared under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former house occupiers now share their pebbles with them.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: you can see them on injected disks or freshly painted facades, which were cast with color bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “Left Autonomous Violence”.
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as bodily harm are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
When it comes to violence, she is reassuring: the people in the 94 are her neighbors, they certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in the Rigaer for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer has consciously moved to Rigaer Straße - and stayed.
That’s why it was so important to her that the residents got their street back: from the police, politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed sovereignty over the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road is still taken away from them: faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old residents.
“In the end, these are condominiums that aren’t interesting for many here – people who aren’t so well-groomed are more likely to live here,” she says.
“I absolutely cannot condone violence and destruction.”
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-up people who are annoyed about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just as someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Refugee Commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social pedagogue supports the management team led by Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, refugee aid working group, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying wool milky sucker, which has a problem above all.
Thus, some - less ridiculous, but rather aimed at the multitude of tasks desired - had meant when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
We were looking for an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying wool milksau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the people on the ground and behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has fixed a 50 percent position to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon there will be new containers in the Wasenstraße
For some time now, a serious problem has been finding housing for the refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for connecting accommodation.
You must accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from the county office to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private homes.
It does not work so far, so you are dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal dwellings must be upgraded, as they say so beautifully.
So, new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the key word, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
“More places would be good,” says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help janitors, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
This is “no occupational therapy.”
Activity is not just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers also jump in here.
It is essential that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can meaningfully bridge the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, cannot work and is useless, will never integrate.
The vast majority is motivated.
But there are also cases of problems, honestly says the customer, "people with whom nothing goes at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always also to motivate others.
This is all a “mammoth task.”
A difficult question: after the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive, but a residual risk can and does not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also a topic for refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, the main and volunteers on the ground and in the region have to look for activities.
They always have in mind that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politicians are afraid.
In fact, it is unfair to place them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet reached where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrating the previous people wisely.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Helicopter burglar wanted
The police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men broke into an apartment in a multi-family house on Lindenweg at around 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and fled the uncle.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled towards the city center.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to hunt down.
The search was unsuccessful.
Eventually, the unknowns found themselves near the apartment before the act or during their escape.
