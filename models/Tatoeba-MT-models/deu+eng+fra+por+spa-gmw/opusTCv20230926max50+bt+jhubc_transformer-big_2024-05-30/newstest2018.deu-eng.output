Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where it is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Smallholders manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich brings exciting stories to light.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Everyone knows this, who had to get upset before, because the car navi indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the state government’s Geoportal Bavaria, are anything but up-to-date – but precisely for this reason very revealing.
Especially when you compare them to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not immediately recognizable as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army commander occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to push the project forward, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates from 1856 and is, like all others, available on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between earlier and today is the most impressive on the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a district of Munich.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered corridors from the so-called "original recording", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots are no longer occupied by farmers - but rather by small gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" plant.
There is a large green area north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, the Urpositionsblatt reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße people with delusions were once imprisoned.
In 1858/59 the Munich district irrational institution "Auf der Auer Lüften" was established.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden managed the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was progressive for his time and ended the chaining of the so-called madmen, for example.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.
Initially, there were 280 patients, but later it was extended to 500.
Eventually this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost is located there, one of the largest psychiatric centres in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Institution, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.
To the west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the insane institution, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as "Hauptplatz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs blew many holes in the city center in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work takes place and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking for the second S-Bahn main line takes place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens’ Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to take effect by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have been occurring recently across the state and are being noted by the group,” the statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have civil rights violations that people pass through.
They are being stopped because of their skin color, they are being beaten or killed,” Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline during the state’s voyage and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers in the state are stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
“The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees of what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready whether they bring bail or let relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, which ranks the state in the country’s 16th place in terms of the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department to other countries, but lately, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weed fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.
CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the ground.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his company, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, feeds 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot profitably operate on such steep areas.
The grassland area takes care of a lot of work, a lot has to be processed with the motorsense.
“We are struggling here with the conditions and with the topography,” Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run a organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the leader's promotion".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out for a while.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they can continue their operations,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often criticized for funding
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 through the grazing fence.
The open holding area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total cost of 71,500 euros was funded by Leader, a quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women you can't do it."
Also for Peter Weiß it was clear: "Here the best food is produced".
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote weed fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
Prerequisite is the presence of a conveying backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towable (hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being carried out by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build fences for almost 16 kilometers.
The open holding area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House Is Taking on the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate them as much as anyone else - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically curtail legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
In order to stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
As Miller Acosta slandered, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you are referring to that was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is right, but as he put it, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts.”
There has never been a time when the “miserable waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s US.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus — and her friends, who were committed to putting their words at the base after their deaths — knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The linking of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it back a long time ago.
The great screaming Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative bringing the American flame into the nightly world: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Quite unusual, Limbaugh came across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to ignite the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “something special develops in Scotland” and the athletics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’ll continue to do it until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or practiced, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete at her fifth World Championships in the 400m hurdles, says it is “incredible” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland’s best total number of athletes at the World Cup so far was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
Mid-range runner Muir leads the way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included winning the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and in the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me,” she added.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podiums.
As for my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Block critics on Facebook: Don’t apply for public office if you can’t stand heating voters
The father of our country knew something about the bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn’t long before the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He complained about the criticism, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away—and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland for Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with “Well, and?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan isn't a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s side – which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the commentary section of The Post.
“I also don’t appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack,” others would likely call “foreword.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest and silence protesters.
This is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable ports had an effect similar to that of the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers joined his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that downplayed Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are at the core of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led to the finals at Archerfield next door last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance club being built, and we’re seeing it achieve its glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course at its best, it's in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy to see how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this result in a study.
“According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking,” said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "little in time", according to the head of the building yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since there is a lot hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The driver's ignorance of red lights and gates is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the buses are allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was inaugurated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote through a public hand-raising before the occupying forces.
An existing movement rallying for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour morning car ride by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and corrugated roofs that have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her lively hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
“In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains an suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
“The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
“It has cost the native Papua – the Mama-Mama [women] of Papua – their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to tackle inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts — including Paniai — en route to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You said.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali as two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers stumbled upon their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk chased and beat the group with their pistols, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government commission building was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"As I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was overcrowded, many shots were fired,” he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, including his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, carries only one name, TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” her station because she was being attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papua police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the next day.
For three weeks, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathies for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic misfortunes in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through,” he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress at all,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by the military, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Paniai neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," said the 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the wounded being quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a hotbed for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and then, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in recent years, under the pretext of “securing national sovereignty”.
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papuans and new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or skills necessary to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia’s troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group’s allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence for human rights cases.”
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are likely not going to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he must repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire on Friday found its way through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-tall, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the skyscraper in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we woke up at the fire alarm and the screaming of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the fire fighting units had extinguished the fire at around 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing housing for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of skyscrapers around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior cladding to decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of panels for insulation and disguise at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) failed with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on only two sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also very appreciated five-set classics are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only narrowly missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve applications.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: In the future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. Travellers Bringing Prohibited Items into the Airplane, Survey Finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they were late in discovering that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people — conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. — also found that younger travelers were more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying objects with blades through security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done so.
It’s no surprise that the people who were most likely to carry smuggled goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through security were the ones who were most likely to fly.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has implied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-triumphal numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time a different, less brilliant number when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: those of the cancellations on the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk has frequently advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (US$1000 and UK <0xC2><0xA3>1000) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it will be 500,000, all models combined, and in 2020 it will be one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Those who order a “Model 3” today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 – if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-tested production lines without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPO Chief Pruitt Withdraws Due to Delaying Obama-era Rules to Reduce Emissions
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit brought against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline that expires on October 1 for states to meet the 2015 standards for near-bottom ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved on to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in ozone standards simply amplifies the EPO’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the deadline for implementation,” said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have.”
Nonetheless, the EPO’s opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its “delay authority and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on sound policy and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
“The reversal of the EPA – according to our lawsuits – is a major benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for protecting the air we inhale,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to engage with polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
Tumlingen’s friends and supporters have made the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church located therein to Tumlingen with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg there was not only the former parish church but also a stately court, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the noble settlement center of the village.
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 support these historical facts.
Patronage law arose from early medieval church law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor continued to own that church and could inherit that church.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The older of the two broke apart at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in World War II in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were broken and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen pensioners" maintain the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle.
Designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with written contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 3.30 pm.
At the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only a wind turbine concentration zone existed on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent "savings" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning law, the approval notice issued is still illegal and therefore also illegal to withdraw," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim verzichtet sich".
The current state of affairs: the city council has again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a approval from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded by planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association "Boisheim resists" in terms of content.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households is to be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-seat households.
The NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and Tractor Collapse: Woman Dies in Terrible Accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving her car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion on the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealers plan "home shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents for shopping in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend is intended to sensitize customers about what offers the own city has available away from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center are supposed to invite you to "Midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the campaign weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the trade association and the city enter another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" for the Brunnenfest including open Sunday sales, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals also lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help revive the city center - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
With a network, we should overcome the lethargy that had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time on the nationwide third "home-shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should promote “the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities,” Streich said.
The action under the leadership of the ICC and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
Other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also found dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As the cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put Mexico under pressure after leaked transcripts of phone calls over border wall payment
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president slandered him for publicly denouncing the wall and reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for U.S. refugees emigrating to Australia to take over was “ridiculous,” “mis” and “stupid” and that the persistence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “dep” after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore’s Ford Massacre: Activists Revive Racist Lynch as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-stripe suit - took a long pull from his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates were frightened.
"We want this n----r Roger!" the man roared.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene that was played on July 22nd is just a remake.
But when a snare is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience gave off very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murders.
“It’s really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the retelling serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A coroner puts a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynch on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for Lynch’s actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their vote for the first time in the summer’s pre-election campaign.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they walked away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concluded.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the killings, removed evidence, and covered up the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks makes it even more concise.
“It was a right to vote massacre,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: ‘If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you.’
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual retelling of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their depiction is vivid, poignant, and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because then we will be confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - thronged into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene’s co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role never gets easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, sampled their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who screams at Hester and presses him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
“No,” Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--' him back then."
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R'."
And that’s where the energy moves in the room, a sense of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning praise speech "Strange Fruit".
His voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has come from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s pressing moisture for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song are over, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpse.
Children squat at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies, and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynx rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks down with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women whispers.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chatting excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for what the performance felt like.
“It’s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks’ court at his table, he eats and reminds him of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
“The retelling is inspiring in some ways because it describes the horror of what we’ve endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own history, whoever does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it.
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The turntable (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it parks an open Mercedes-Oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf’s leitmotif – money, power, and greed – that flows through his “ring” staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen, which surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he slays Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oak) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy are celebrated Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humbly bends his hands to the Merkel-Route.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows up on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his management team had been eagerly awaited.
If he had to perform a whistling concert in 2013, there was great rejoicing five years later, in which the isolated "buh" calls sank.
Festival head Katharina Wagner should have been happy about it.
“You can see that the audience has somehow come together with the ‘ring’,” she said just before the dpa’s performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I’ve also worked at school all day.
What are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It’s a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-working volunteer.
How did that happen?
Q: I graduated from high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let’s say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, where you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point maybe also, really.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social work in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Youth Office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different locations during volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
It can be done from retirement homes to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about static calculations.
You always have other people in front of your head who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
QUANTITY: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that’s the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
Pearson said on Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is underway to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job cut, which Director General John Fallon announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
In a third cost-cutting program in May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) to revive a business that was taken by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after achieving a 1 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the latest violence that Afghanistan has committed this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from NATO said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device".
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay the Obama administration’s regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “2015 ozone regulations,” saying it showed the agency’s commitment to work with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners,” EPO chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations — which will measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to set where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards — by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump has sought to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered a setback by Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
City Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: in the event of two votes against, the municipality council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future residential complex for seniors.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the part of the land that is still missing has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is owned by the municipality, there is no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common space.
One of the two investors, who are still on the boat, has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council plan to provide such a common room not only as a meeting place for residents of senior-friendly housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget already last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common space would be eligible with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
In order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw any sticks between his legs in this respect, the proposal states that both saddles - which is based on the construction of the environment - and desk roof - which reduces the treasury height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessarily, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the board unanimously.
It’s not that easy in the community room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many own buildings with which one does not get so well ahead, but now one leans out of the window at the common room, she says: "I am hard at it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land, one does not give a subsidy, but gets a real value, which can be marketed in case of doubt, is the opposite discourse.
Staiger's request to split the proposal accordingly met with three supporters.
So it remains with two opposing votes in the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we are going to take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: cyclist thrown on the road
On Wednesday in Garath, an 82-year-old cyclist was hit by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m. with his bicycle on the bicycle path of the Schwarzer Weg street.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He collided with a car driven by a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a trolley.
FC Bayern Munich must renounce David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to make the match against Dortmund hang out.
With personnel concerns, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The staffing concerns of the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) with the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to dispense with David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good last.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Hiking from star to star in the resin
In the Harz, the first "star trail" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz region.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be in question.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail will be extended by train.
"On the Star Path, viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines brighter than another, even though it is much further away.
It will also be communicated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can be clearly seen with the naked eye.
At the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, something similar to the planned star-worm - the planetary path - has existed in the university city since 2003.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its stelae leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (Gemeinschaft Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away is at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unsuccessful World Boxing Council lightweight champion, went down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what the fans demand.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree next summer with Garcia on a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing himself openly fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready..."
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "a huge fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-round champion from Riverside will look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tire crash
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. just before the end of Marktbreite, presumably after a tire placer.
The car hurled right into the embankment, where it overwhelmed itself and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates – two adults and two children – were severely injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the emergency service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2:2 start of the season against Braunschweig, the optimization of the defense formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and with the result also, if the two opponents had not been in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defending player from Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the trio chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes no longer want to catch themselves.
“For the future, it will be like no one else will stand in line alongside Michael [Rensing].”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the three-piece chain than with the four-piece chain, even after the experience in the preparation.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the three-way chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is that we harmonize even better and we don't afford so many playback mistakes in the build."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a failed start after a tie, I don't know.
The performance could be quite okay,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight game days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, only because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of a severe weather.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said, believing that the Aue players might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a tough and complete game like Fortuna against a promotional favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are right now,” said the defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we claim to be in the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's head coach.
“To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.”
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medically assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are over 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began carrying out the tests last year.
During the asylum process, they are to make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Verket) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while another 25 cases were judged by the Forensic Medicine Agency that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his or her age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there are 442 cases that “suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the kind of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case it’s about 10 percent.”
Fully on plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Office of Freiburg.
Work on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach began at the same time in April.
The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted concrete bridge covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has gone through the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-ton so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fastener that is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
This is what the pedestrian path should be.
The special thing about this is that they are finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The installation of cables through the building in Lauterbach required a special touch of the finger.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handouts.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the collector’s house in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher entrance.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is €700,000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under one hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that peacefully displays the flag on this day, because the AfD invites Rondell to the "great campaign start" according to the poster.
And it brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the event starts don’t want to listen to the AfD learners, but rather to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that can be found there.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the One World Forums and one of the leading organizers, really is pleased with: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and a lot of food, including an "Urdutch potato salad that the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had made an effort for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but received a rejection there, because there were not enough parking spaces available because of the already built Laurentius kirmes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondellplatz he says: "That is the good right of the people, main thing, it remains peaceful".
It also does: around 8 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 audiences in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix von Storch to deliver their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is to be cleaned up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can get away - no special incidents.
Trumpet meets trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfach tromboneist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo tromboneist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to transcend the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new garb, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play merge into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core element of the programme was only premiered this spring with great success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
“Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's best-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her breakup, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I’ve always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz" she suffered especially from this, but in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'"
Especially to the public, she doesn’t like to explain her love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection...today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you when I am a Democratic governor.”
The rally broke out in rejoicing.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration with Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night, saying, “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to a Democratic party that would stop us rather than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governors and the control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is just the last rejection of a party that is top-down without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message,” Ronna McDaniel, RNC chairwoman, said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises ‘honest’ Russian apology for doping scandal
Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an obvious Russian apology for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to return to the sport.
Russia’s athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the athletics world championships that his country’s ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he is sorry for “all athletes who have been snatched away gold and silver medals in competitions.”
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought today it was a very open response, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reshaped.”
Coe said he was also “joyed” that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to re-establish Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
“The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re-employment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
An act of mourning for fallen soldiers in Mali
At a funeral ceremony in Fritzlar, North Hessian, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali were remembered.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the as yet unexplained cause of the crash.
She described the two pilots as "the masters of their craft".
“We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the Fritzlar Cathedral St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a Bundeswehr death watch.
At noon, only the relatives at the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and Bundeswehr Inspector General Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The captain of the staff had set up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belonged, declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen that the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn’t want a tomb next to his wife.
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried remains unclear.
But he has no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a stop because he was not happy with his title.
After the ascension of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and earned the title "Prince's Marriage".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after his death, said Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the River Thames in the French embassy.
While his later wife was always in touch with the people's expressions of sympathy, Prince Henrik had a hard time during his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography about the first few years in Denmark, Henrik said: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine over beer, silk stockings over knitted socks, Citroën over Volvo, tennis over football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and that had a reputation in this country as being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a swift re-election of the Landtag after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
He called for the dissolution of Parliament on Friday.
Earlier, the surprise withdrawal of a Green MP from their parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said in Hanover on Friday.
Björn Thümler, the head of the CDU group, wants to recommend that his group accept it.
Together, the CDU and the FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new state parliament will be elected regularly on January 14th next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament deprives the Prime Minister of trust and chooses a successor.
“Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally in a clean manner,” said Thümler.
“All questions will be discussed in peace, if they are considered legally reasonable.”
Thümler called Twesten’s step “something curious.”
The politician herself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their state parliament mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her mandate, which she has received via the green country list, with immediate effect," state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
Green Party leader Anja Piel said: “We are extremely sorry for Elke Twesten’s decision.”
It has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
“Even with no content differences, we can’t understand this step.”
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to voters, but also treason to red-greens," the Social Democrats chief wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the state parliament quickly re-elected.
The exit of Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
“In her hurt vanity and frustration, the politician puts her personal interests before the good of the country,” said SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty intrigue game and trying to win political capital out of it.”
Björn Thümler, the leader of Lower Saxony’s CDU group, wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
At the time, the CDU was the strongest party before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a tiny majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states post the latest information about the affected eggs.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has moved up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany’s concern.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe for health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not marketable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it’s not the companies’ fault.
Are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly at fault.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in the event of an emergency.
Is it just the staff or the conclusive responsibility?
It was just the official controls that uncovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where there may be criminal offences are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in case of food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and marketable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
This means that manufacturers, retailers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-providing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter promptly and without any gaps.
How Football’s Financial Rules Impact Neymar’s Moving to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the governing organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar’s transfer was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can surely loosen the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break even points in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs’ debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP allocation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell in disgrace in 2015 from the presidency, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to advocate deterring from excessive spending.
"Certainly, FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer amount for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements in the amount of 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart its financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with club owners.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this to be legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA’s sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come from payments made by the 2022 World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said.
“As soon as a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwestern Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to a quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-and-white chocolate plates packed to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect: for a chocolate maker, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to endeavour to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, first-class customers will be pampered with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the business class, passengers will enjoy Schoggi from Lindt and in the economy class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short-haul, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup Final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the Diskus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-years-Grunge era (when thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars went to Paule's and Run's Po, Am.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stepping into the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny kids who grow up - they nevertheless managed to make it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character browses through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The adorable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn’t lost his virginity.
And there’s yet another crazy-evil plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a very successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the Excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon’s lower lip beard from “Singles,” whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose final scene will show the bands how they will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it is not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend their time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the Voice Out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.
With six long episodes, it’s moving on, and the comedy isn’t fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited to a shorter length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make anything a food for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Strike against the drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Konstanz Public Prosecutor’s Office announced on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and have already been issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italian raids at the same time.
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italian suspects.
The two are likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.
Since the summer of 2016, the Constance Public Prosecutor’s Office has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
As a result, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations focused on Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the account of the gang.
Wise laments large gaps in the foreigners register
"Data from citizens who should not appear there": According to one report, the foreigners registry in Germany has significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious misjudgments in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned Mode in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, “of people who are long gone alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register anymore.”
“Erroneous data inputs can significantly slow down return processes,” the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people who have to leave include EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such false assignments, however, led "to a distorted debate about the handling of expatriates", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been conducting such proceedings "regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - in Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically impossible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU state they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly.
Italy has made guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these promises to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the German parliament, said: "Families with children are threatened because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system, human rights violations and a threat to the well-being of the child."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community in the meeting of the council of the municipality pays tribute to the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s ingenious how our bodies are designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even more disinterested,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the preserves are broken down into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK Circle Readiness Manager.
Obviously, the change to the theater a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter dispensed ten times each 500 milliliters of their life juice.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and slowing inflation dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family incomes amid mounting pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-fueled inflation, and she said credit costs may need to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year after Brexit.
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks starting next February, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – with <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: “In the MPC’s central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on households’ real incomes continues to put a strain on consumption.”
On interest rates, she reiterated that “some monetary policy tightening” would be needed to cool inflation and a “slightly greater” scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be made "gradual" and "limited".
The Bank’s downward-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations of an interest rate increase and GDP rose from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy over the next few years cannot “prevent” income declines, but she added that wages will recover “significantly” by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates dropped to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank’s latest ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation drove pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6 percent last month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and would re-energize it in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot in relation to its 2% target was "totally" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking loudly for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and the new mortgages are closing, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 People
Patients will be given access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment starting in September after a fight in the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-sexual pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the process after the Court of Appeals last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be worth <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used, collected and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said, “This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful HIV prevention efforts.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt takes us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be conducted across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us move closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Big Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi’s architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the premise.
“The steelworks are quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push up the door, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’re going to sell the land — or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
“In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the ground.”
Here, they have managed to increase the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that a good design and increased square footage can transform an apartment from something standard to something quite astonishing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave her.
Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a row over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide his property and business assets.
Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul owns property worth $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
“The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a 2015 first affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business – from which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but instead accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading attorneys including Allan Myers, QC, and both-sided law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, “have become embittered about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has held back a lot, even though he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the TV star’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in court.
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In a letter to the court in mid-2016, Colin wrote that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
“Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to curb the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in the hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the White House’s new chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first working day, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information falling into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he got good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades — and now that he’s in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be convinced,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes constant praise.”
Okay, I'm sorry.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know others — that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from sparking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - who is busy with this story - reported in May on the consultants' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative news clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stepping up to find out where these came from.
That’s exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a pile of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he has not offered concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not naturally known, indications from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of the winter.
The experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
There were 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
So far, 36 of those sought online have been arrested, at least eleven of them on the basis of indications after the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the West Midlands’ most affluent homeowners are once again at war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the “Millionaires Series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a trench dug by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defensive facilities and squeezed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have lobbied Solihull’s council, which said it was “useless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by taking long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can’t even stop it.”
A local resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we’ve just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A Solihull Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside across Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls Police, taking the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case.”
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is transformed into the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
After the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues from the tourist tax were also lost.
In the fall of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the county council as a collective accommodation in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But especially Freudenstadt’s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction dumpster containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear how extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, some of the ceilings were dismantled, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
“It’s actually a nice hotel,” Thomas Scherer told our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautiful citizen" as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
One does not want to position oneself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be positioned broadly, Scherer explains further.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Michael Krause, director of tourism, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are consistent with those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the forefront, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: U.S. special investigator sets up grand jury
In the Russia affair over US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have appointed a so-called grand jury according to a report.
The panel has taken up work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the move to be a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is said to be several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller was also examining more and more Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Counsel Trump personally brought to the center, investigating whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Juries is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to bring charges.
Grand Juries are therefore also called Indictment Chambers.
They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process is always carried out behind closed doors.
The panel can also be activated by the public prosecutor to invite persons to interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued revolving around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then campaign leader Paul Manafort were also present at the talks.
Legal experts said Thursday night on U.S. television that the inauguration showed Mueller not being intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not have to mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the imposition of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he knew nothing about the appointment of a grand jury.
They usually work in secret, he said.
The White House is in favour of any measures that have "fairly" accelerated the Special Investigator's work.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
But Mueller wasn’t appointed until Trump fired Comey.
Because of this release, accusations had been made against Trump that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation of then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media reports, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his staff.
This led to speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special investigator, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later-resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the president’s urging.
Several senators from both sides want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday introduced bills that would make it difficult for the special prosecutor to be fired.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg Driving in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been detached from the shelf ice of the almost seven times size of Berlin.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers, is now heading north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
At 175 kilometres long and up to 50 kilometres wide, it is one of the largest ice giants recorded by researchers over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus, which has now been broken, has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Shelf ice floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf was disturbed the balance of growth and breakdown a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and could disintegrate if a piece breaks at a key point.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not raise the sea level, as it swims on the water and displaces ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres, according to AWI figures.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
“Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position,” said Martin O’Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he said.
Scientists are arguing whether the Larsen C-Schelfeis will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature rise contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants to pay a household fee for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the Kreistag win 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 apprentices have their first day of work behind them.
Apparently, the teaching positions in the circle are very sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the parties' wishes, the administration is to "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented, show concrete measures for newcomers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to take action so that no more jobs are left unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint proposal with his party.
Recently, he caused a fist-thick surprise in the Kreistag, when he publicly questioned the cover for personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities to be reviewed that allow an exit from the municipal employers’ association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay employees and civil servants better than the collective bargaining system for the public service actually provides.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy sharpens the tone to NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue doing so if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization Youth Rescue because its crew had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess any allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescuer', Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking inflatable boat migrants on board, which are delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such encounter allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail “significant changes or hindrances” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had fallen sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors had paid off.
“In recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of being able to reach Europe.
Rise and Trials
Nine Weiler bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and attractions for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint lined up with viewpoint, connected by "flowing" trials and moderate climbs.
In the last two days, many altitude meters were announced again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and lodges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe healing brine in the open air inhalatorium.
Neustadt was also targeted.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4,500 metres of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest at its best – sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through in the wind and weather fighting over the stadium grass?
The fact is: eSports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high wages included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an esports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there will be a lot of clubs on this train."
This coming weekend, the FIFA World Football Association is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the players of different clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in esports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal especially with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be online much more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In esports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are contested at the competitive level.
Long time ago, as in normal sport, leagues have been established, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea certainly takes getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - e.g. elevated heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness are required.
Professional gamers should not only work out on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls were difficult to carry out in online games, and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in esports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were invested in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
In comparison to the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is little.
However, e-sports “is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are farther away.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in esports betting company Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
At a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject of instruction, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, football clubs are now obliged to set up an esports department, according to Dutt.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and to transform the old days.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt said.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only in football everything stays the way it always has been."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all federal states are affected by the scandal about poison-laden eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Texts Urging Conrad Roy to Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands, and downward-facing eyes when she was condemned.
“Your actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility,” she said.
“She showed no regret.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant impact on her actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying that "there is no day when I will not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity.”
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was “persecuted” by the realization that she would never attend her brother’s wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“Not having that one person that I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car in 2014 from carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life.
“Hang up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don’t know, there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared legal opinion.
Among the few defending Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times, “Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison.”
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lame of FC Bayern
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to join the Audi Cup as captain.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner to have a great season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, he held up the tie assigned to him.
"The coach has not announced it," the Confed Cup winner said after his first appointment as Bayern captain.
Well, the start could have been better than in the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach Kimmich could also interpret that way.
It wasn’t the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Eleven consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come out of vacation, but he.
You prefer to distribute sugar to those you trust a lot, which you want to keep in a mood.
So whoever has been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich said: “That’s what you want as a player: to take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, this is his position, the white bandage on his arm did the rest.
And Kimmich acted like the one who could take the rudder the best in his hand in this starting formation.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He looked at the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches to get on with the performances of the Asia trip (also worked only to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle to not stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times to build up the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we had hoped."
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "I was also brought for this style".
How unusual this Bavarian world is for the newcomers, one saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer needs to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer just before the match tweeted and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is excited to join our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might well need the famous Bavarian Dusel.
Business satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often irreconcilable when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economics of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at the request of T V of a change in economic policy - and at the same time reproach the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the closure of highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes to have a planning procedure, until 2021 the building law should be in place.
A role in the country's plans also plays the western bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal road plan.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IHK) Trier aims, as encouraged by Wissing, to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which have been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Meister bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the master’s exam and 2500 euros if graduates go on their own within ten years of master’s training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the national company Mobility, so far only 29 jobs have been filled.
The IHK is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, CDU parliamentary vice president, points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The current broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the grid supply in an IHK survey with a rating of 3.4.
They complained about stagnant internet connections and disruptions.
Ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they already cleared the field after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the company as a recall.
European automakers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being accused of coaxing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that can regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested, but drive back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi’s engine development in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft will travel through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info-transparent.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the aim is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
Already last summer the raft drove over the Isar and again this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos Noses and the Laughter Against the Pain
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon cartoonists, the tuber noses of his figures are his trademark.
At 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, “because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he beat himself up as a cartoonist for congratulations cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he once said.
After stopping in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures swarm in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working for almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his funny figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footed opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s strange to me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he is more reliant on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-reminiscent conditions and disease-transmitting insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The festive highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medieval festival.
Merchants, guilds, traders, vagabonds or a country slave camp are to be seen in the city centre on these days.
The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: taking their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no pause from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and its inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we’re suspicious of everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “rest” when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes into the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members buying each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to practice journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious “Maria Moors Cabot Prize” for her coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompevento TV.
“You have to take on the task that falls to you as a journalist – either this or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many dead people... why didn’t you say what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that “smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier.”
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before it was announced that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were instructed by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It’s been months since reporters went to the mountainous landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers had considered Valdez’s column to be the best-informed source for the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its slim body.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacán.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is gone to Washington, where he seeks international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was assassinated, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
Since then, she has asked for her re-appointment by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, “Narco-Journalism,” he wrote that reporters are being killed not only by drug gangs, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Article 19" has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even fled the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz in 2015.
For those who are left behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue was already over, Riodoce’s editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer as all of their phones suddenly started buzzing.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb edge, they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens are screaming nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who were guarding to see if they were on standby.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the enormous portrait of the newspaper’s fallen founder, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of concluding," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her out to the streets for coverage."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible Canadian miner’s rhinoceros have been preserved so well that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could even see that his scaly skin was reddish brown – and they said she had had something of a “disturbing past.”
The report in the journal Current Biology called him “the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) earth clump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just blinked a little, you could almost believe it slept,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shade, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to better mingle with its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the nodosaurus family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defensive method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased from sufficient pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading -- think of deer, zebras, or belt animals -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaurus was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
“Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous-era dinosaur predators must have been,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the seabed on his back.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread farther inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains preserved in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of its fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long lace that protruded from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored plant eater was swamped through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the hunters still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as ‘rare as winning in the lottery.’
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In thunderstorms: mass carambolage on A8: many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car bombing.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5:00 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles, probably including trucks, crashed into each other.
At first there was no information on the exact number of injured.
These were minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometers formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, massive handicaps also occurred on the opposite road - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade recorded the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you sit in the train and sleep.
Or you are deeply involved in your work and just have an ingenious thought.
And then: puff.
Comes the creator and wakes up an unkind or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unmanned ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take up your seat and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two tracks.
“If the offer comes, we’ll expand it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" refers to the devaluation of tickets without creator.
However, to be able to use them, a few conditions must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to book an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You must also have purchased it via the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way to book tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
For the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation will then appear.
Train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already depreciated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train escorts, simply check in in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second advantage: "And our employees have more time than they do today to meet their individual customer needs."
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are one of the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents that you need to devaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card or other document that you need to show is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or open space and delays in the control of your own ticket and in the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled upon a post from someone in high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped her phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police force and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown’s father who carried a sign that read, “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live feed of a policeman standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted, “I’m going to kill you... animals all.”
“This is not common,” Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and we can call it typical."
At that moment I felt shivering.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters starting on the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition.”
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well-developed, knowing not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free to liberate ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn’t experience blatant racism, she’s no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I’m doing her a bad service to keep her away from it.”
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that turned into a camp area as activists waited for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism has totally changed after August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to “document” what happened.
A question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?”
This scepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people, often whites — in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had previously worked with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that is how I will be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience — to show that the movement “is not a messiah leader, but a community coming together,” Folayan said — it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media, identify themselves as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole,” Ferrell said, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really being maintained by black women and many black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront, because in a life at these intersections, a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "Chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "size madness": TV readers discuss about bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it’s not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves hardly any of this topic.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Needs no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian area will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned on the site of the Bauernmarkthalle, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping at the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to hope that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities, this is also the case.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the level of rent.
But that shouldn’t be low on the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not acceptable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more specialty stores and what is left of them will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Bauernmarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery is actually coming at some point.
Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to dislodge all the shops from Bitburg before?”
George Marquet: “This is just not going to work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers’ market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no longer any place for a farmer's market hall.
When the farmer’s market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room at Fridman Gallery in New York, you can see many faces - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she made classified diplomatic reports public via the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he was only three days in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone might look like with these genomic data, has a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, comment not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations as well.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly since her puberty about identifying herself as a woman, was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning visibly sits uncomfortable in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stumps and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t visit at that time and she couldn’t be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letter friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "Suppressed Images", which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama was actually calling for Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy encounter.
There is also something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump wages a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweet-capable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was actually supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a certain reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her surname is marked with a heart), called for an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footed Cs and Gs and As - is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s advanced scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
“What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
It shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in his hand from the disciplinary caserns of the United States like King Kong.
“If they colden your speech, they’ve won,” it says.
“Never stop your mouth.”
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrums that flock together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea, like the movement behind her liberation.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stings.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as a murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been on leave and has been barred from entering the Northwestern University campus.
“This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation,” Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to assist the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
"Police have an idea of where they are staying, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building administrator who had just received a mysterious tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: “Police are currently working on the victim’s timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap on compliance with the code, which outlines the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could give cause for concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of WADA’s approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia’s independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russian retailer RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from conducting doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was announced by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, it can no longer be assumed of any health impairment, it said in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are allowed to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to be negatively tested for fipronil-containing anti-lause agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee’s happiness with your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or – worse yet – fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There just never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called outsiders for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint over the three years.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores - so you can re-drill why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punished those who spoke.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailor-made “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has covered regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to mistreat its employees or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee turnover, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the “Social Media to get their right” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their dirty laundry going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.
Glittern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to be in a company, feel that they belong to their voices, and that the work they do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
Data about employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if a company’s managers do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointment and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, 'Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of that?
And who you don’t care about, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a glint issue is reported, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, thanks to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better retention of employees in an industry that is known for high revenues.
“If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It starts at 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players chat on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have removed their jersey tops and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real kick-off for the guys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended its days — at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during summer school during Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises in the course of August, 20 before the formal game preparations begin for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA’s rule change, even if it adds another point to players’ busy routes.
“We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep getting messed up, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over, which, given the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel that has already been thrown with footballs clearing a safety net behind a gatepost, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjusting to recording an exercise there.
If you have the videotape from an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot eight.
We will do our best with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results below the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday, one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact checkers who may display fact-checking results from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe it also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany backs a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings, as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to recognizing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says.
“What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' spans the Middle Ages to Edward's era, documenting the families who lived in Scotney, each story illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote 2014’s ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library — a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I just responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there himself.
I love the archives!”
For someone so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest, I overrated my welcome a little"), this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent its days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the hyena heads mounted on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, talking to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years of aristocrats saying, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'"
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that two families fought for.
Boys, let everything go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
“There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled ‘Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex’,” says Rhodes.
“The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or ‘The Smuggler’, which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women – I imagine them as a bunch of handsome guys, with a talent to promote heiresses.”
After finishing his assignment at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämämäki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave again,” he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf covered
With the cloaking of the 301-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Thursday’s roundabout).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Artz will keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, a festival will be held on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?” the makers of the action ask since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
“We don’t really think that (of course!),” they wrote on their website.
“But we are using this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
“It is important to make a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point.”
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign an average of five digits.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, it is a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the Prime Minister’s office.
The five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the deliberations under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the culprit of the coup attempt.
486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan called the attempted overthrow a "gift of God" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the lifting of the head scarf ban for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the army and the security forces continue to purify themselves.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7,395 public servants fired, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real masters of the country.
Three times they put on their role as guardians of the secular order of state.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting the Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine Vocal Europe, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
Anyway, there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansings about the readiness of the Turkish army to act.
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” say NATO diplomats.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter regulations on obtaining visas for temporary work permits, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the U.S. is issuing green cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate track for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the Rennsteigshuttle has been disputed over and over again - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the muddy track on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is particularly important for tourism," State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl said in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country will take over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle will continue to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being definitively voted on, Sühl said.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“This negotiates the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards,” said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
The Rennsteig shuttle is scheduled to be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.
In recent months, during a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also severely decayed in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yes, really.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we’re going to get to see them a lot more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling, as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah" that conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as tailored to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be "in the mood"!
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape when one takes a step toward Frigid (named here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are popping up at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the entangled bodies and the pierced eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, to the point, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots don’t represent real women.
You can’t part with your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing suggestive of independence or anything that might interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are gracious slaves.
Or to put it in the way of 2017: maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-format families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the US with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-electing relatives.
We're all supposedly trying to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticeable is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relatives she had struggled with for decades over politics, is suddenly and peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I notice in another context that this also involves significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the creepy possibility that one day his pets won’t repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
Nowadays, I find myself being plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which in fact appear to be one as very mild crimes compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunchy and the animals twist to look fearfully over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a large roundabout in the north of London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can walk on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in a department store this week, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it’s the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what a neutral exchange should actually be, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood excusingly grinning as I tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treating cuts to his wrists, which he suffered according to prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against Pistorius' six-year sentence this time, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to high school.
School principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental town hall in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school graduation, the 29 pupils of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm, but then was released into freedom.
In addition, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Hühnerhof".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it hatch from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was shattered, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and vanished.
Afterwards, grades three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s rehearsal.
The hens danced with the young gockels carrying cylinders to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young is different from the other young (chickens), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader that he felt accepted into his new school.
It was followed by a thank you to the colleagues, the former head of school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps into teaching bottlenecks, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to dismiss her students after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth-graders.
At the end of the day, all the students sang a song about summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first-graders are already enrolled.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested in Sithonia by the police.
The same day they were released while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose.
Controls will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: what people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesels or worse are exempt from this.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives comments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have cheating software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Federal Motor Vehicles Office (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has informed to write to each affected person.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the overall conversions last?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the issue of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is the price of Euro 4 cars at risk?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But especially in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesel engines.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate with his wife Melania in the awards ceremony.
The award winner Lear, who has become known for progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told the New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the means – and that weighs on me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s urban builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable candidates are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And he still enjoys the work, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
In this way, there should still be enough time for an introduction, taking into account the regular notice periods.
As Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must show appropriate degrees.
In any case, the city wants to keep this function.
If it were no longer able to complete these, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.
But proximity to citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports of a good working climate and good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, several important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and its employees.
But in the future, varied projects will also be on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun.”
There was a lot of room for a city builder.
Haslach’s own building yard and nursery can be used to react quite flexibly to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under monumental protection, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a high level of responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end everything runs over my table."
In terms of support and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Depth Construction) has been with us for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the position and wants to stay".
Because continuity is not only important for a good business climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the information of the city of Haslach, you should be able to demonstrate a completed degree as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the areas of building regulations and planning law.
The municipal construction office is responsible for construction and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, management of urban properties, municipal farm with building yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on cables: South railway line blocked
According to the police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators assume two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver near the crime scene.
"This goes far beyond a buzz stroke," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator(s) would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delayed minutes and the costs of rail replacement traffic, rail customers could also face the perpetrators.
Overall, it should be assumed that there is a "significant" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without hindrances.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of them related to long-distance transport.
Goods trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, overhead lines had to be replaced at around 200 metres.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diets, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal mucus, when the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was housed separately did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice — the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but lacked them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they obtained the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid — without the bacteria — to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
"Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic
Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40 million signing of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues' pre-Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put a lot of effort into it.”
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington state, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously advertised this.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hanover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no fires from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the confederacy – that was the most important wish of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
They were lows.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising withdrawal of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and the FDP.
Greens CEO Michael Kellner has urged renegade Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate,” the German leader and campaign leader of the Greens told the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"This cannot be true at all," sighs an SPD election fighter, as the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands without his own government majority after the transition of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It became so – and it all got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to a shakedown, the Düsseldorf-Pleite haute the party smoothly to death.
The comrades woke up again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, the G20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication after that he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And now, too, Stephan Weil.
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has long been criticised for the VW exhaust matter and his role on the Supervisory Board.
Miserable survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying increasingly hard in recent weeks to put accents in the alliance.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden even comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is basically not to blame for the party-internal discord of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz isn't.
At times, the comrades therefore strive to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
“It is unbearable and democratically damaging how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else,” says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party’s left in the SPD parliamentary group, the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms. Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the Lower Saxony Greens' national list, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as top candidate in the federal election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been more promises from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Rehabilitation areas have existed in Empfingen since 1991.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy still stood at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it was important to also promote interior development, and not just to open up new construction sites.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe government received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros came from the land, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
Schindler continued, “We will investigate where the ‘really old’ houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
On Wednesday evening, STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal-Country program "Social City", within the framework of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.
The remediation area would then finally be established as a statute.
The granting period for the grants will continue from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, as part of which the participants in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, if possible, the by-law should be adopted so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban problems and deciding when and to what extent they will be rehabilitated.
A refurbishment note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself would come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing arch", information on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operational sheet" is only to be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "wind and wind principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty" for those present.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to come in house and car with a hand motion
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military figures left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was exhibited alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility,” the HMX-1 commander wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event at 3 p.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limited hours of service.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained with the aircraft on the ground during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided to TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The “Made in America” event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was serving taxis against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is thrilled by the ‘Made In America’ show — which showcases products from all 50 states made by American workers made of American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn to take off the US president at the White House with precise centimetre sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "Non-Presidential Support Missions."
The White House said the taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly tariffs for the 2017 fiscal year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's flight time is recorded as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
“Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but instead take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present this week things that are made in America,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that.”
It wasn’t clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of them.”
TC BW Neuss in front of a tricky task
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will compete in the third place of the table, Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third table of the SV Suchsdorfer.
Despite five games still flawless record, the leader of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained a sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar formation.
In the back positions, I think the team is very good.”
Suchsdorfer SV’s imports from the high north ensure class and stability.
“Their Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup appearances.
And they are also strong in doubles,” says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it’s going to be hard for us.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north stands practical.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman in the challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga match, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in Liberec (Czech Republic) will be playing for his first time this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday at the ball with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel.
But he was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also re-enter the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America Can Harm OMV
Donald Trump didn’t look really happy when he put his signature under the tightening sanctions law on Russia on Wednesday night.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress has packed in a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Investors from OMV, which is co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Nord Stream 2 pipeline with other European companies, have been concerned since then.
The threat scene is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which ones the group could defend and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put in the spotlight in the Netflix hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and featured the latest villains from the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world’s richest drug trafficking organization: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the guy who invites U.S. and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the daycare lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the urban daycare centres, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal day care facilities (Kitas) again under its own management.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Assistance, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled food.
The city operates 46 day care centres in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2,800 children were sitting at the tables, and the demand is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, it is not just children who are cared for for 45 hours a week who eat lunch in the daycare center," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care, if children stay until 2 p.m.."
46 part-time workers will serve the kitchen from 1 September onwards: they warm up the food supplied, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, dispense the food, tidy up, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are permanently assigned to a day care center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the day caregiver to implement educational concepts."
This is also what it is about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.
“The kids are supposed to help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
“They have a known power in the daycare, a person they are familiar with, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - not only improves the quality of the kitchen performance, but also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in the comparison of costs between self-direction and third-party awards for the city, according to the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are being re-hired.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan Democracy Depends on Women’s Political Role, UN Says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run in council elections in the provinces, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, the elections will be peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, reportedly tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men contacted the 13-year-old who was with friends on Kolpingstraße at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo escaped.
The two men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB Concerned About Investments in McVitie Factory in Glasgow
A union wants to be sure of the long-term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow with the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said the company has been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which, among other products, produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVity’s owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be “experienced first” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's urged it to "express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced."
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow Area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross’s branch manager only received a letter yesterday from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continued engagement with employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all our business units and locations – to remain competitive.
She added: “Over the past few years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility, and should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record robbery?
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering wages of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to have one of PSG’s best players sign.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, that will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar.
Scooter overthrown and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw down a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the disguise of the vehicle of more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg Police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, is asking for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the dashboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was heading towards Leese with his VW at 19:55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau.
In the area around Stolzenau a car met him on his lane, so he had to dodge to the right.
The Touran driver touched the deck.
The car caused damage to property.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
It may well be, according to the accident victim, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissioner’s office in Stolzenau at tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen is still a source of discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church a great deal if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticized the fact that the reporting of violence in the cathedral parishes was measured with "two measures".
Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are “disgraceful and shameful acts” that should be punished and prevented in the future; but the “degree of media manipulation” is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with the Bavarian Radio, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said: "You like to go to church and this is a found eating".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "strikes have been a quite normal pedagogical means" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."
They would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial volume "Mein Bruder der Papst" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he assesses the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, states: "To sum up, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is striking that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him.
In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal with the Regensburg cathedral spats Georg Ratzinger is in his opinion relieved of the burden.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against those in charge of protection at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became handy when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you, as his biographer, rate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you bother and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
Only eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-accomplice or co-knowledge in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
At best, he may be accused of learning about it too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzen Gymnasium, in which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, also exhibited a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warmhearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and sweets and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has already led to outbursts of anger.
That he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed slaps and too naughty boys on the hair or ears, he himself already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you know such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are of course petty things.
One wonders whether it has more to do with his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him.
Many who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the context of the report, a lot has been reported in the media on the topic of abuse in the Regensburg Cathedral Spats.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be blamed in the final report for any involvement or co-knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
“I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it,” one person said, “it was all very embarrassing to me.”
The real problem with educating on sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster, who would have been, in a professional sense, a colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in terms of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: One student interviewed put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... also really absurd to assume that he ... boys have opened up more intrusively or more clearly or rather, than to their parents, boarding school leaders, trustees, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "That the pupils concerned entrusted themselves to him and/or their environment in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger must therefore be exonerated from any co-conscience.
Nor can he be accused of having prevented him or of having brought him to the display.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "excesses of violence" were read in the Regensburg Cathedral Spats.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem, that in the coverage everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This, however, is an abuse of the report.
This is a clean separation: between the preschool and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence as well as, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the Domspatzen.
All the horrible beating education, the cases in which boys were bullied and mistreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horrific suffering, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellemeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different about Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And the same applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him".
At most, the accusation of having looked away remains.
But despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was told about the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and of the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to them that "in preschool the beating penalty continues to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were also long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been crossed.
You can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty at schools was also officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the times.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "string of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was perpetrated in preschool on adversities and violence against innocent child souls, which goes far beyond what was then usual.
It’s all horrible and I’m glad it’s finally being worked out.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. pulling slaps on the ears and hair, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in his conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of beating also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form from the previously nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and candy alone, you don’t make rebellious boys great singers and stand before any success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, good-natured, deeply believing and good-hearted person, from whom you can not imagine that he could harm even a fly.
I regularly get to see how many former Domspats still today, 23 years after his emeritus, regularly contact him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but he was also a lovable person of respect, whom they still look up to today and whom they truly worship.
And please, once again very clearly: all that is accused of him are educational methods that were then the order of the day.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time a long time ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
The report, which has just been published, relieves him.
Now the decency would order a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regensburg Cathedral Spats, to finally leave in peace.
