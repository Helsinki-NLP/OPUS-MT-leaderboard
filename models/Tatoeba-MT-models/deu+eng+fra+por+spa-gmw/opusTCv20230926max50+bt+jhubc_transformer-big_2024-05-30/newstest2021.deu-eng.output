Presently, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury to the At and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the outing ban.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the county office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder called on citizens to remain calm: “According to our information, this is a closed circle of people.”
On the farm, infected people were separated by uninfected staff, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of seasonal workers’ housing.
"This can be bitterly revengeful if such local infections take place and regional lockdowns need to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens' parliamentary chief executive.
"After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be closely monitored.
Obviously that didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came “with an announcement.”
Subway station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into trackbed after pusher
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a thruster and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday at the Aidenbachstraße subway station around 4.15 pm there was a dispute between two youth groups.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich man (17) shoved a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb off the track.
There was no danger from an incoming railway.
According to the police, there were again disputes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the crime scene, but his personalities could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
The storage of data is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned ten weeks for a half-year.
Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a rapid change in the law.
Seehofer wants to step up measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “make urgently necessary adjustments to the law already now,” the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, the storage of data is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Justice Ministry told the newspaper that it would only make sense to examine whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already in June called for a retention of data.
NBA: Stripclub trouble for clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, a 33-year-old professional basketball player with the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, however, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, is back in Isloation, is being tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, “Sweet Lou,” as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote, “Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, U.S.A.) have the best wings in town.”
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which starts at night on Friday.
Söder expresses after mass infection on the corona location
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, with over a third infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now quarantined and is closed with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the county council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client was cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
"His mandate was plagued by bites of conscience and greatly affected by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in a fire last night.
The fire broke out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no evidence of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the sights of the investigators.
Abolition of the 50+1 Rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the European Commission creates completed facts," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
“For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate does not get around whether it is not advisable to facilitate the inclusion of investors by clubs that want to break into this phalanx."
But he doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of pulling investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that “attempts to provide more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship”.
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me,” Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“That has already occupied me very much humanly.”
The gift, worth around 11,000 euros, he had received from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
“With the ominous watch gift, I dealt with it completely transparently and with ease.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a hole out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
“That may be naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”
"Black Lives Matter": injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have intensified through Donald Trump’s deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between protesters and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train was just crossing a crossroads.
Previously, clashes had once again occurred in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed protesters.
Hundreds of protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her home in Louisville in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that calls itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger.
The police set up barricades because anti-protesters from a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting of the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they had taken a suspect into custody.
Further information on the circumstances of the incident has not been provided.
Mayor Steve Adler told The New York Times that he, like many in the city, was “dismayed and shocked” by what had happened.
Also in the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to a construction car in front of a youth prison, and the police used glitter grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times", 16 people have been arrested for resistance to police or bodily injury.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters had knocked in windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night.
The fire could be quickly extinguished again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured.
In addition, windows were struck in a courtroom and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or parade burned, many came to their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
“I think we’ve managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair,” says Sylvie Thormann, the curator’s director.
The guests would have liked it.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones were also the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the history while strolling and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual program high points, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic march and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year,” she said.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there in the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's already more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were in the park.
“We are very much hoping that the rider’s quadrille will take place again next year,” says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish runner-up Fuenlabrada
Spanish second-tier footballer CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer flew from near Madrid despite first corona cases on July 20 to a game in the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, one low follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one was admitted to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-Group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecutor investigated for a possible offense against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced resignation of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a quarantined hotel.
“Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel,” the sports newspaper AS wrote.
In photos, players hung underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, he wrote.
The club said they were happy with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, dismissed the accusation of intentionally endangering public health.
The president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, said he had not violated the Corona rules set by the football association, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four people infected by July 19, but all of them were isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, "five or six" other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must catch horses ripped off at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user communicated two free-running horses on the feeder between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
By the time the officials arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
Shortly before Dampfach, the officials could win the trust of the horses, so they could wrap a rope carried in the striped car.
Cycling pro Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time driving specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just setting up the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year’s corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Previously, he had woken up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: What if?
The professional cyclist acknowledged that there are some aspects that he finds increasingly difficult to handle.
“But it was good for me to remember what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me.
The time trial specialist is back in the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).

The driver was no longer able to brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau) a 57-year-old biker hit a car in a right-hand corner on Saturday despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria’s Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).

"For the safety of motorcyclists, we have achieved a lot in recent years," the letter said.
“The number of motorized bicyclists killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.”
Kovac test against Frankfurt with Monaco
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion hosts the Hesse, the former club of the Croatians, on 1 August at 6 p.m.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hard test before the return game in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
“We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
This is an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final hinspiel against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new corona infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
There is also a case in the city court.
This approached the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 deaths due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe flooding in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people died due to heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers lost their crops.
Armored rhinos in national park die as a result of landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are protected and considered at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which is attributed to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New homes are empty
In Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazaar.
Enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, even though it was small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of housing.
Many homes are empty, but will soon be relocated to those who have lost their homes as a result of the floods.

Argentina rejects counter offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," the statement said.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around $66 billion.
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, is sticking to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest claims amounting to US$503 million and thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"It's going great" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take over the succession of Lutz Feller in the notary office in Eggenfelden.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up work, the normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has for the time being an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring country, the town of Eggenfelden has of course been a term for her for a long time.
During local visits with her family in the past few months, she had once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s career also plays a central role in her homeland of Lower Bavaria: after studying law in Passau, she completed her apprenticeship period and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "shouldered" her doctorate in labor law - she took her first position as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, which finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has served as a representative in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the entire team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future - and has immediately received a compliment for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and crèche spaces, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here again soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are planning according to the current state with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, around four million euros had been lost to the BVB per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the accountant if these revenues completely break away".
Given the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently “well advised to take a stable side length first”.
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are short-time in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their part-wage waiver, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short work."
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies that are taken care of annually at the Graz Children’s Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few – like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael – are extreme light weights with not even one kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither the lungs, nor the intestines, nor the muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that it could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be on voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger grins.
"Even if they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: the whiteboard as a stage was experienced just before the start of the holiday, the 9th classes of the St. James's Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the city of Aalen presented the students the production "Das Heimatkleid" - and that by video.
Subsequently, the students were able to exchange via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Even if in the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would still offer additional stimuli, you can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theater.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the game's operation," said Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was revealed by the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been confirmed.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualifying.
This was revealed by the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD-Sportsschau.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should Zweitliga ascender Würzburg reach the final, sixty would already be fixed for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to prevail in the final match against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third league.

The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and produced her alongside Eroll Flynn.
Eight movies she made with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award for best actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She was also recognized as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the starring role in the filming of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied für eine Leiche".
Marriage with writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) resulted in the son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke down.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, however, have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at comeback
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the "Road to Timmendorf" beach volleyball tournament.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semi-final.
Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome last September.
In the final match on the Rhine, their defeaters Ehlers/Flüggen against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde took a 0:2 (17:21, 17:21) defeat.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, from the point of view of the FDP, only a "feigeblatt" and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Court of Arbitration of the AfD had on Saturday in Stuttgart confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
“If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been excluded,” Strasser said.
However, there is no political will in the AfD for this, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.
Similarly, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is excluded now says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "World on Sunday".
Rather, it speaks volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD.
Blume expects that the AfD will again end up below five percent in future elections.
“The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered.”
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the string as "secure right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Federal Board of Directors threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that at the time of his party entry, Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Home faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and with the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg State Parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change anything about the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, whether with or without Kalbitz.
This decision will not weaken the federal party or the right wing.
"The meuthenic team's maneuver is clear.
You want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits it called.
A throw out does not change anything," Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"This is where the AfD-Landesverband and the faction held their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the Federal Arbitration Court’s decision.
North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, wind power plants in the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth said.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid area, have supplied an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The offshore wind harvest thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing €20 billion in the expansion of offshore network connections until then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
This year’s record day is January 2, when North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
It could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Galerie des Gmünder Kunstvereins.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual framework after the corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" became involved.
Freital: Windbergfest canceled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But ultimately, as an organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flown to the festive site and into the festive tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a popular festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg will wait for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winter Mountain Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympian Werth not to beat in Achleiten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at four starts on the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with gold and Quantaz at the start, she could not be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the Kür.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth won on Sunday in the special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cut ever.
Already in the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
In the future more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University of Applied Sciences continues: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of study not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are used evenly at both the university and the DFS Aviation Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences Worms have been in the Air Traffic Management program.
Nine students have started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS have been very positive, the performance of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the piloting profession.
“In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to carry out our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of the DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation's professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms, underlines this: "The foundation's professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German Air Traffic Control is at the same time a motivation and an obligation for the University of Worms to further develop its teaching and research competence in the fields of future aviation.
With the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students in the field of tomorrow’s air traffic controllers.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stresses: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in the field of air transport in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was completely closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, because after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford at 12.40 p.m. at the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the bend and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency physician and the patient was flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Immediate tightening of the law is imminent.
Are they right, and will they?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses shall no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel during slaughter, dismemberment and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers will be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee leasing, if you do not want to completely choke the economy."
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their value creation at the customer for large areas of the crafts, the construction industry and the plant construction industry.
“Individual misdeeds cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: “My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy.”
Work contracts make sense.
“If an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal work contract.”
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is unexplainable why in the future, when portioning and packaging cheese should be considered different labor law than with sausage, says a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
If it were banned, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry, according to the results of an examination by the NRW occupational safety administration, partly 16 hours a day.
They often did not have a break.
Salary was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, they have been circumvented by "trick-rich constructions".
“Now we need to be thoroughly cleaned up.”
“In the Occupational Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry – for example, higher test rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for community housing.”
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry as well as to the Occupational Safety Act.
Brandenburg’s consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transports," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died according to the police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesperson for the Wesel district authority said.
A parachute was found at the accident site, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially known.
Eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday also went peacefully.
Lastly, a few dozen people remained on the square, but left it before the start of the lockdown at 1 o’clock.
The police had been in operation since the early evening with numerous officials, a larger police force was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend there was a ban on entry for the opera house, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked from the crowd of celebrants with bottles.
At least five police officers were injured, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car overwhelms itself: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on Federal Road 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car got off the roadway for a hitherto unexplained cause and overwhelmed herself several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to clear the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was scanned from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for people.
However, the forces did not find anyone among the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to the Kasseler Klinikum for further care by ambulance.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Championships in Italy
Turin - After a saving goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the history of the club perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in spite of visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a free kick variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old from the penalty area used directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the glamorous but decisive success.
The foul-metre shot at the latte in the 89th minute should only have had Ronaldo himself right in view of the goalkeeper rating.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly," coach Maurizio Sarri said after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s ultimately reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become a goaltender is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals in his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rom at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentinian scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is in the Champions League round of 16, but will have to match Olympique Lyon with a 0:1 loss to reach the final tournament in Lisbon on August 7.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to give gas to countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: In the last year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Comparative figures for the previous years do not exist, but the Raser are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutor’s offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, according to the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had fled from the police - also this is indicated as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes in the past, and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Motorway 8 is particularly popular with raspers. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular race track
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
There, a speed limit is used to try to brake the raspers on the particularly affected section between tights and geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upgraded sports and luxury cars often have Swiss badges, because the drivers avoid to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would eliminate this problem on motorways from our feet," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD-Landtagsfraktion.
"The inhibition threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to be legally on the road here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Whoever in this way breaks all rules and not only puts his own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly possible with reason".
ADAC calls for more police action
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the Transport and Environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-tourism effort to become more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men took part in a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, collided against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, sharper penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action is needed to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely, is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man serving himself at the fridge with drinks and then left the snack through a previously knocked-in front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.

Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory at the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
On the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann won his second day’s victory.
The 26-year-old from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Hermannstadt, after already winning a stage on Saturday.
It was season three and four wins for Ackermann.
His Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided on the mountain time driving for himself in the morning and thus took the top in the class.
Only 104 riders had reached the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain time riding.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he just put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in insulated hygiene bubbles.
Viewers at the start and finish were not allowed.
Guidance on Lay Reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call arrived just before 1 p.m.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescuers took over the resuscitation shortly thereafter.
The life-threatening child was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
Police have routinely investigated the accident.
The fire department spokesperson said: "We are expecting a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and occasionally more than 1,000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to step up their control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nürnberger Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia Police, an increased volume of vehicles was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at about 10:30 p.m. in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their efforts against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people to the top, the police said.
However, only a small proportion of those present should be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it could be assumed that these were mostly viewers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site control measures were completed around 1:00 a.m.
All in all, the officials found that 10 vehicles had undergone such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the arrival of amused people," it said.
News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, which we must not scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to do damage.
After all, the young people are supposed to get their cars back undamaged.”
Numbers of the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of short-time work abuse
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) investigates about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker’s allowance.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-term work," Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director responsible for the operational business, told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When at the beginning of the corona crisis suddenly very many companies had applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually lasts up to three weeks.
“We didn’t have that much time in this hot phase.
The more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there will be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
“Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are diverging, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency benefits."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by local drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal parties in the parks.
In the parks of the foundation there are always gatherings in which the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 by-law are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neuer Garten.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed at dusk.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more waste and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have meanwhile reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on the night of Sunday.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are there and there cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
The first infections were publicly reported on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of interns who had celebrated in several places and may have become infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he told Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19 among young workers.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the spread of the coronavirus throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
New infections focus on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the final match day of the Premier League by a 2-0 (0:0) victory against their direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed by and also qualified for the royal class in fourth place.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United led by a penalty shot from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the follow-up time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final.
Chelsea, opponent of FC Bayern in the Champions League final, won with Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as a Chelsea coach.
Chelsea’s victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately matched Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1-1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declines after five first-league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, which has been a British champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the scoring record in English football.
The top scorer holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an exceptional season," said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "that should inspire us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses will also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature termination or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Eventually, however, the season could be played out without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
Israeli police took violent action on Sunday night in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, police used water cannons to dismantle the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu’s office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters blew drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the head of government’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested by police near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on demonstrators on the side of the road from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of rapid loosening and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has seriously affected the country’s economy.
The most recent unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to record new levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen claimed nine minor injuries.
A driver was on the road with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said: “She had suddenly stopped because she wanted to turn off.”
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three people were injured in the car and six in the van.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea shuts down border town after corona case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to defend against the coronavirus as a "bright success".
For the first time, the country is reporting a suspicion.
Because of a first official suspected corona in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a major city out of fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malicious virus may have been brought into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership issued the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "bright success".
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high.
There were investigations of some people.
North Korea on Saturday called an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party’s political bureau chaired by leader Kim Jong Un over the suspected incident.
The “dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe.”
Kim had already ordered Friday as a preventive measure to “fully block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others,” it said.
The person affected and all the people in Kaesong who had contact with him were placed under quarantine.
The party’s central military commission should therefore investigate the “outbreak” and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
Kaesong is home to an estimated 300,000 people.
Tension before council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still before big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale urban development project East," it is rather casually said in the middle of the urban press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majority for this is scarce, most recently in individual committees even rejecting depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, commerce and IT), the project developed by the citizens and then by the administration and municipal council now not to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unintelligible", "speculation", "defaulting" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list for a year now.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: “I know what I’m talking about.”
The exit will be cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is, contrary to statements of the city administration, after grants, whose existence Klein is convinced, to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicts in the city hall and on the part of the proponents of the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the castle hill, the rental of the former valley for administrative areas and a smaller-scale downtown refurbishment ideally with local authorities.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise caused by road traffic, including many temporal reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the VCD noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the reinstatement of the parental contributions in the municipal day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year’s delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the League of Supersport Cars could start regular operation, the first test drives were now underway.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know more about his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche,” says Zimmermann.
“With ABS, for example, you have to go differently in the corners.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other in a blinding way and we have also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 Serieneulingen, knows the route.
In 2015, he was last a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast Carpenter really is, it turns out in two weeks.
“The teams, of course, are a bit of a poker player in the tests,” he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly pressed calendar.
There will be seven races by the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take on the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spain’s holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona figures in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the deadline holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain in Austria is considered to be one of the "safe countries", for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbott said.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapp."
Almost a month after the end of the corona crisis in Spain and the expiration of the strict initial lockdown, infection rates in the country are rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday countries of the British.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are exempt from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been recorded in Spain and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the navy in his country the equipping of warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the agency Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket Zirkon built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It will also continue to be built on the Poseidon underwater torpedo, which can be equipped with nuclear equipment, it said.
The planned seed drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed a military boat himself, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has a coastal area as large as any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the national day celebrated by sailors.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces began the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside President Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defense, not only warships, including a submarine, but also helicopters and fighter jets were seen.
Hurricane "Hanna" hits Texas: aid difficult due to corona
WASHINGTON — This year’s first hurricane over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains have now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. climate agency NOAA on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott has declared an emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas is making the work of aid workers more difficult, Abbott said.
Evacuated to be cautious
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott told the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the Texas hurricane, he added, “This challenge is complicated and is being aggravated by the fact that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state.”
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to," such as wearing masks, the governor told CBS.
It was important that everyone stayed away.
In some places, hotel rooms have also been provided.
In addition, it should be tested for corona in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit ashore on Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest-level hurricane.
For the coastal stretch from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was issued and later recalled.
Authorities were expecting a slowdown as "Hanna" moved further inland and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the forecast, it will be near the largest islands in Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Above the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into powerful storms.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of an under-average one even at only 10 percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals dismissed: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic scored two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals scored: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team,” commented the Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had led through a goal by outback Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also took back the referee team according to the VAR.
In the follow-up time, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
“The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few training days, Hansi Flick recovered "somewhat well" and has to think after the first team training, how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich to have the third most operational minutes, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to miss in decisive royal class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter the right-hander broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf cart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A stake in the finals against Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bayern do not want to be stopped by the misfortune from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick mentioned the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be demonstrated by his winning title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the King Class finale on 23 August.
"We have simply mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup.
Now we have to create something special,” Flick said.
Until Munich can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve, but the eighth-final duty against FC Chelsea is the first time.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the corona pause, the Londoners should not become the Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Final dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game,” Flick said.
A test of tuning is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players for noble shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the pitch after his move from Manchester City.
“Like all the new ones, Leroy fit in well,” Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. were no longer just allowed to train, Flick talked much more about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, Londoners will now be trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game unlike the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final are Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy", stressed the head coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
World record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 tuning.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also an ambitious one on Sunday.
All of the performers were present, including Thiago and David Alaba, a defender willing to immigrate, whose whereabouts are not assured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to elect its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix races, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o in Portugal will take place.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. compete for World Cup points on the traditional Italian circuit in Imola.
According to the current status, the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races.
“We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Chase Carey, Formula One boss.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be completed in the premier class of motorsport in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi, which have already been officially scheduled for December, media reports say there could still be performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require races on at least three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are to be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "extraordinary circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be canceled at short notice due to the impending corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection comes under criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being back with them next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
Infection rates in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a refusal.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil Look Against Donald Trump Goes Around the World
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known latenight show by video and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. latenight show.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful of the world.
Also about her famous "evil look" during her meeting with Donald Trump, the teenage girl spoke.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to divert the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children take to the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her, she finds it "fun" as she shows the reactions "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly evil look after U.S. President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF emerged, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at this moment?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she replied briefly: “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.”
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick answer and disappeared briefly, laughing.
With her “How dare you?” speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund real estate with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the follow-up times of both halves.
The 30-year-old from the Fourth League has now 34 season goals on his account before the end - the same number Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died.
He died peacefully asleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumentary loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There was arguing, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems also played a role.
Three years after the band was founded, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
Already at a young age he was fascinated by US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later was given the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green did not cope with the media hustle, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
Life between music and addiction, he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he relaunched in 1996 with a group of musicians.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke at the time of a return to Earth rock star.
Free from drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
