Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time at all with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony, at which Obama takes over the prestigious award.
He is the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes the price.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he intensified the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmeda, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The programme of events then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, which will be attended in addition to Norway’s King and Queen, as well as the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests.
Obama was very reluctant about the price from the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt he wasn’t entirely worthy of the prize.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that this was for him "invitation to action".
Protectors are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases last year, he filed appeals against some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokesman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian villages you can find the sorting waste containers again.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate trash cans.
I am not saying that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council is not taking sufficient care of this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of trash cans for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at the center, for example?
This is art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian Square opposite the encountered goose.
Mr Onderka, let us not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey licking in other parts.
Whole rows of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
They are too far away from the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova Street I didn’t see any color trash cans in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when I was riding the tram.
The garbage almost went over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetic probably leaves the Brno socialists cold.
They’d rather buy the city an ice hockey league that’s a shame on us all over the Republic than buy a few more trash cans and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of Southern Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But also not for the national debt interest rates or for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed through the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive spending, retirement or sickness benefits in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mine laying," says Janota.
The loans are paying ever higher interest, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs of the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now given more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
For the pensions or sickness benefits, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid, they will get this money.
But at the price that the state is even more indebted - next year will not only be missing 163 billion in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus increase more and more rapidly and together with this also the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-profit package.
Due to the diversion of money in favour of some constituent groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are predominantly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-designed and possibly depreciated.
At best, get it, which is not free.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, and Europe's money supply is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ went into the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, replenish the pension account and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
But this is not the end of the Carnival of Revolutions.
Nearly three billion dollars lowered the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for legal disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international legal dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The minister must then save money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two-billion-dollar project "State Treasury", which is intended to allow on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans expect a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test sample with two operating systems to journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to come to the customer within the year 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Sceneless slopes are not only a concern for the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited frequently.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but by now they are afraid to order legally.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want the New Year’s Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your expectations, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of the stay comes second only, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year’s Eve.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too will have to give in and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura appreciated.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds at all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available here.
Good sales are also found for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia at the central car park in Janske Lazne is 80 percent occupied for the New Year’s Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year in January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now February, but the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains certainly also increases, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel owners of the Giant Mountains are now waiting for a bigger snow cover.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But then a warming will come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost weird with what student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he even thought was the stupidest.
Finally, when he sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he was copying it out of the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase “as in Iraq” several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: “New Way Forward” without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea – sending fresh troop contingents to Iraq plagued by the civil war – as “an irresponsible and, in its conclusions, a catastrophic decision”.
The following months showed, however, that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful insofar as there is no talk at all in the news about Iraq today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, because he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting point than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
To increase the troop contingent, the military has again asked him, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the habits of subordination, harshly criticized the daring shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but came up with no better idea, and so he cheated on the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and complete this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even in spite of the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only sham buildings behind which the patriarchal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the unclearness of the circumstances that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The building of a “capable state,” which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy astounded by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "early homecoming" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul who cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is in decline.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush mountainous suburbs.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period when America moves after Obama to withdraw the victor from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Managers of Goldman Sachs Bank no longer receive bonuses in cash
The executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the broader direction it has to go, led by former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses over the course of this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
The high premiums in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers’ bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record-breaking women have won this year’s Nobel Prizes in the categories of subjects and literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for research in the fiber optic field and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes, won this award.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and the certificate of the acquisition of the money prize.
It is worth ten million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
According to tradition, the American President, Barack Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and moreover, he is at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the execution of the state budget for next year in the form approved by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps Janota’s remaining in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis in public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the President’s spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to negotiate with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, the parliament voted on the Left Party’s proposals for a money change and increased the money for state officials’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed Social Democracy’s proposals that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Right Party, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, because of the question mark about the further work of the Fischer official cabinet, on the design of which the SDG, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fischer government in the autumn, and which they understand should end the national debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem" that represents "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek pointed out that the budget is gruesome, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong utterances".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, exceeding 200 billion kronor, was appalling.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was occupied by an American actor.
The story is about sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave owner, a fictional U.S. president, depicted and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely is someone who is still alive and important to many people.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unsettled", and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team climbs up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I have found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it will be transferred, and I felt like I know what you are feeling, he said.
It’s important to me to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have outweighed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar in his house for the first time.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, ‘In the movie, I look much bigger.’
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Mystery Over Norway Dissolved: Russians Tested a Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, however, and the rocket called the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for the Russian generality as well as for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the rocket tests had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers are already writing about "Bulava" as about a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This 13th attempt was normal in the beginning.
It was not until the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" departed from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskiy, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern paths was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, the generality has guarded itself against it, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was carried out without error, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore satisfies the generality with optimism and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps out his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and probably will already compete against Petersburg in the Friday duel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can elevate the morale of other players, Nemcinov said.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game, according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, winning 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career, he also earned NHL successes, where he double-crossed the Stanley Cup in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s spokesman, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, for the reason that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive this in hindsight for the Saturday shift on November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid for the ride and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to demands and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift another 2 overtime hours.
As soon as the agreement is signed, the trade unions will revoke their readiness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchar said Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
On the other hand, the management held that employees had to make the overtime to comply with the automotive delivery requirements.
The unions also demanded that employees who had interrupted production on Wednesday should not be subjected to sanctions.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are calling for the reduction of overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand the payment of 5,000 kroner.
The Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The series production started at the company in November last year.
As of this September, around 80,000 vehicles have been manufactured here, with the current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also acts on ‘stealed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that are intended to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as strong an effect on common virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the patient can prolong the life of the drug and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus propagation also results in the development of resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metallocarboranes act on the protein that is responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus propagation in a different way than any drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new "improved" compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Deceptive and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease-induced HIV virus fission, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in test tubes, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarboranes on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, make the metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of Academia.
Dispute over budget. ODS went on Fischer, who resists
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek called the approved budget for next year “grayful” and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement by the SDGs called the prime minister "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the Cabinet of Officials with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the left-wing parliament.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, though with Left Party amendments of more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the amount of money for salaries of public officials, for maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed Social Democracy’s proposals that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to operate with a arrears of 163 billion kroner.
The SDG has left the room before the vote, so it has complied with the government’s request, because also the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendments were accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the prime minister for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the lack of budget.
To what extent Fischer is in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Social Democracy (CSSD) nominees who had enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also make clear that he will resign if parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness benefits and pensions or the new service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
That's up to Premier Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function sit people who confess to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to renounce the fight against the deficit level of public finances, “it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament.”
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is up to date, then I will deal with it," Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrat Party, told reporters in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for the European Council meeting.
The SDGs resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the SDGs would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister would explicitly ask the MEPs of the civil democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, so he responded to the question of whether the SDGs were not pushed back during the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikization of the parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railway will stop or limit some less-loaded express and local trains from 13 December onwards, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares incl. base and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital are available, for example, to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, and the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The high-speed train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer high-speed trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be lifted and some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connecting lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's invoice for regional railways: 200 million increase
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, a total of the railways will receive 4 billion crowns to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, just like this year. The local trains will supply the districts, a total of 8 billion crowns to pay for it in the next year, with the state granting 3 billion crowns.
This year, regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as high-speed trains, the railway has re-signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps for this reason they have not taken advantage of the price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made to CD Net one-day net tickets and to eLiska cheap internet tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price will be increased from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 kronor.
Philippine militants arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, in the south of the Philippines, 75 people were kidnapped by militia, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
The agency AFP, which initially reported only over 65 abductees, said.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militiamen allegedly used the hostages as a living shield while fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now working to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police pursued the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, standing rights have been imposed for the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to the governorate.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film “Invictus: The Unbeaten One” will be released in American cinemas, covering a part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics and the public will also be loud.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
High expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa on the one hand culminate, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the cast of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, in his own words, proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela in person, so that I could - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can use this film to emulate Mandela’s personality and his message.
This is a South African story, but it affects every person, he added.
In the rugby national team dress
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Unites the People, portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman strives throughout the film to bring together two racially distinct populations, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also takes his role in the South African national rugby dress to the world cup field, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white public, thus gaining the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may make it possible to bring people back together into a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve will only be shown.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in a recent interview for LN rugby fan Christopher Dawson has betrayed, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem district fire brigade, Lukas Marvan, six units were attacked in the fire.
Originally the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later they changed their minds and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, an internal transformer shortcut.
No one was injured, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the line system.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced with a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened in the Ceps company, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the line system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy into a distribution system and line line with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jancura is suing three CSSD leaders for slander.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today is bringing charges of slander against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s effort to operate regional train traffic in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, while we have only submitted the offer over the scope, as it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the company Student Agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution to be the continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail transport and uses lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the detrimental step of the districts.
He told Radiojournal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and intends to continue it after New Year.
He stated that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railways with the Czech Railways and did not tender for the order at a high of 150 billion kronor.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and inconsistent with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was also threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He imagined himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal bacteria changes the usual from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already now, votes are reporting that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum prices for the vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections born on August 2nd last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who started the vaccination already last year or earlier must also pay for further revaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
All in all, the experts estimate that the health insurances spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s area vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including inflammation of the brain skin and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children aged up to 10 years die each year after examination in hospitals.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, it will be paid and voluntary by the insurance companies.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, for example, mentioned the head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association is already promoting long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The professionals at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
“I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The chairwoman of the Society of Practical Paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, one could think about reducing the number of revaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary," Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is associated with a concern of practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "extract the money from the health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
American artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested when he invited 90 paintings into his vehicle with a trailer.
Frank Frazetta junior and another man are said to have used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father to "enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a warehouse."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta denied Senior having given any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the preliminary report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had “passed” an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wage statements for 2011.
Social security anger
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of impending “problems.”
The increase in social security – to around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SUBJECTS OF THE VORAB STATE REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy is shrinking by more than expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year poorer and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 a year will be <0xC2><0xA3>190 poorer, while someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be <0xC2><0xA3>110 richer.
The ministers said their goal of deficit halving by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops were “a drop on the hot stone” compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – which affect the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit repayment – were challenged after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year — far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously projected.
"Missed Opportunity"
Conservatives who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion in debt is untenable over the next six years.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay it and press themselves "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
“They didn’t say anything of importance about what they’re going to do,” said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond, “they had their opportunity to do that and they let them pass by.”
“The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives’ proposals, which see deficit cuts coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned through the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disabled pensioners next April – the Chancellor would be exposed to the accusation of capturing votes, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra help when people need it most and that the situation be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not announced any state details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come to fruition in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, business consultant at the business audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Panjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing in Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the indictments they are charged with and the circumstances under which they are being held,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are indeed the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by one of the students’ uncles.
He said local police had been interested in the house earlier and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but said the U.S. must “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuses' in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, Iran’s human rights are still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details “patterns of abuse” by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the start of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They beat me in the face often,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
The battered presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and raped others.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he and 75 others had been held in a container at a prison in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to examine the post-election unrest and the government’s response to it, but said Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
The ski slope was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump hill at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talent.”
Prizes were awarded for the best performances - or tricks - performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters voted to ban minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s declared most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argued study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country for one and a half decades, and its impact can still be perceived today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls “Islamic Free Spaces.”
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim Woman Marry a Non-Muslim Man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists questioned by Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who now show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism may be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
It questions the extent to which French policy makers (and the intellectual elite who are so passionate about separating church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "tightening of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Desolate View in the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them melts at alarming speed and takes life with it that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Skilled in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the sea, who fought only with the pistol of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos typically still have one millionth of the range of life of an ancient wild animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has become all green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and sledge-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to track down their prey.
Ironically, in the waters to the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century showed for the first time the turbulence of the packing ice.
In the Cold War, submarines tended to move the ridges when submarining.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of measurement probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater gutters compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened by the passing of summer ice, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
“In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be that,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World Wars 1 and 2 and the Vietnam War as their target, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held on to each other in the icy air.
Some read out the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white square cards, which had been placed in the moist mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of naval infraction officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free..., my son paid for it, she said.
“When I’ve been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. Government Contractors Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, U.S. State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The special indictments have not yet been released, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "threatening".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase tensions between the Cuban Communist Castro Brotherhood and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earning of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used top-of-the-line for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. agency in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
One activity that would be legal in any other free society - the surrender of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently released a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", an allusion to the inauguration of the country's older brother Fidel Castro as a leader.
Vivanco said the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and detained within one day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries move towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after finding them because one of them made consensual comments on the YouTube video site about terrorist attacks.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to subvert the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a refuge for terrorists.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men — who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI — underscores the crucial role of recruits in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered incredibly attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding that negotiators at the city’s Bella Congress Center take bolder action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists walked through the city with banners that read in English "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that said "The Earth says 'Enough.'"
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother’s homeland, make her aware of the heart-wrenching problems the country is struggling with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That’s part of the reason why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to spread the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothes set off several explosive devices near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as lightning missiles but were then followed by “a few big explosions.”
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of major officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thinks the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I wasn't even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show stubborn racial divide
The mathematics testimonials were welcome good news for public schools in Washington, D.C. last week.
Although Washington District is still far behind the nation’s top-performing schools, the testimonials show that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington, D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of their African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eighth-graders basically remained the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in that district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown in this time frame, the difference has hardly diminished with now 58 points.
Some proponents of education in the district expressed concern last week that the results, celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were mostly promoted by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for education equality in Washington, D.C.
“I’m not jumping up and down for a range of two or three points,” said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, which I respect.
But what scares me is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and middle school who did not master basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who lag significantly behind their peers of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and lifelike experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, has been brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work on getting the best measures to benefit students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performing schools needed to narrow the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could have political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements of closing the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered “a milestone” on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stands out and blinks for a moment as she sees the white pillars, brick facades and emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth-graders in the group exploring Gettysburg, where classes cost $38,690 a year, was more of an awe-inspiring visitor than an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really?” she thoughtfully said when she was told of the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of Hispanic immigrant children born in the United States who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanic Americans graduates from college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study high-performing children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist over an extended period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Spanish-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP, and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue to run until they complete high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of Iraq’s oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly-seeded representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies leading the way for Asian and Europeans, Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service, said.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns further underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely deterred American oil companies, analysts said, adding more involvement in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest proven crude oil reserves.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on the sidelines of technical advice in recent years, have run out of business.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-run China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world economy’s greats as well as a tech power.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be able to compete with its counterparts and meet its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies made bids for bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda top planners reportedly killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, an al Qaeda top deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported on Friday.
This would, if confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, are said to have been killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals, who are suspected of being part of the militants, ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate character of the US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this in no way reduces the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul to resign
U.N. envoy Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term that was clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also voiced his concerns that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but only fulfilling an agreement made in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN...
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to arrange for a replacement.
“What I’ve said is that he better start looking for a successor,” Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
UN officials say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
The sworn position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Oath dismissed all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith’s accusations — who was fired — “have undoubtedly harmed the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election.”
Eid said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be used correctly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regimes have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day voyage through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, downplaying the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, that is unpredictable to the war itself.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “their people will suffer tremendously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the U.S. government joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to curb its nuclear program and waive a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran appears to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements ever since -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees over whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community standing in relation to some of the proposals they had already agreed to in early October has frankly brought the international community together, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way they have never been in connection with major additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “suppressive sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what it called “groundless and unfounded claims” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities on Thursday, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly over borders, property rights and over the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength by the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the impending troop withdrawal, US representative quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change in price in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them talks that “Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children” and “One baby more means one grave more.”
These lessons they learned so well that, when government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, suddenly began to change course this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: “No way.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a HR manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has spawned two generations of notoriously thick, sprained single children, affectionately called “little emperors,” is triggering a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN said.
Department of Population Issues, while the number of the population group of 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to increase explosively from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of reported Shanghai residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age must have babies “to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Established in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state representatives have attributed to this policy that the critical use of natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions performed, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule — including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children — and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said government officials have even recently discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples two children with one partner to be single children.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and swipe through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town outside Shanghai said there was an upswing in applications from couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, urban districts did not report any change.
The municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000 still receives as an example only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai’s Caolu community, said financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this is also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child by the seventh month.
Yes, we are being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she wanted only one child because she was also an individual child. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone cared for us.
We’re not used to caring for others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with double careers, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
Today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China’s capitalism experiment and they don’t want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, puts huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "You have to renovate your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Develops Emissions Reduction Plan
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- refocused on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations facing the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has identified both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out as more than 100 top politicians from around the world arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that policymakers would contribute.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has put together a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which the industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave the talks a boost by promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks last week had determined.
U.S. Secretary of State for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not funded by the developed nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than the Bush administration did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging markets rising and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough, to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern delivered his statement an hour after Chinese Vice Secretary of State He Yafei’s statement that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked “reason” or it was “highly irresponsible” from him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China master global warming.
With the future economic direction of the great world powers at stake, break lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle relates equally to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the great powers were fighting to find out who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone more aggressively to hold those countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states’ offensive is “putting political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now united and demanding action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues still need to be resolved before the arrival of government leaders to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister disembarked from their planes and raced through the passageways of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to pin down claims to be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people come and go to the congress centre every day, guitar-playing activists hold night shows mocking countries they believe are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are hand-in-hand rather than emailed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: Almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then embark on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter towns, working hours would be radically reduced, and switching from airplane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road traffic jams.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still put the brakes on British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand over the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
As a result, he receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would run west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best working option,” said one railroad insider.
Upon completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The drafts offer the trains the possibility of driving at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people could run on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operating on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that in London there would be a need for a terminal where 20,000 passengers could be handled per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing tracks in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a crucial crunch point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to rail, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage on 75,000 pounds of conservative orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservative House of Commons, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons had to live on “lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-timber plantation at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons approved the motions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the House of Commons members. Last night Duncan said that the motions "could not have been even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million (€1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending control point of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a conservatory called the "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased cash intake during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
Last month, after an examination of his expenditure, the committee acquitted him of the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the collateral for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London home to his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election to Parliament.
Documents released this week show that as of March last year, Duncan received approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,500 per month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (€2,000) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage did not change during this time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (€85,000) take-up.
The normal continuous RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his entitlement to <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live on “lean rations.”
“In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like shit.”
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and am claiming a vanishingly small portion of what belongs to me.
And I could have claimed all the damn money, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for his spending for the first time in May, when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered “an exaggerated claim.”
A protester dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds over three years.
When asked last night about the raised mortgage, Duncan said, “This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the value increase.”
He added: “There is no debate about dodging and looping or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your believers to admire Brighton’s beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
“Beyond,” an alternative church group spurring spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event kicked off on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, stuffed with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", with the hut decoration being the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer priest of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Copenhagen and around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on combating global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, according to police, one hundred thousand according to organizers, on the margins of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could take effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chairwoman of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate is contributing to what these demonstrations illustrate that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed by, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-unrest police have intervened immediately and without regard.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April, have been arrested.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters have been arrested "without distinction", underlining that about one hundred of them were "still being held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was set up to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators arrived with buses and trains from major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen as they have followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “climate justice.”
“Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for ecological guilt in favor of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, as never in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of critics of globalization has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the start of the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hid bandanas in which you boasted of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches were held by a few hundred demonstrators to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounced that this is a "coup".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, denouncing Tbilisi the "coup".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 pm GMT.
Voter turnout was approximately 58% a few hours before the polling place was closed, according to the Abkhaz election commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including former President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a Russian occupation, said his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia wishes to demonstrate by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian president and head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow’s support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, answered Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready for action at any time, arrested about 700 people on the sidelines of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries until December 18, which are in search of an agreement that is to come into force on January 1, 2013.
From the parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train had passed, a group of protesters, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to hammer in disks, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police officers immediately circled you and intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
Towards the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin from a pavement during the incidents, in which according to police about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as police helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or with their own vehicle from major German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in a sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate rights".
“Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the South,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say to each other: we still have time,” says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are rivers through which you can walk, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched with the adoption of the UN Convention in 1992, the movement of opponents of globalization has approached environmental protection organizations.
French MEP and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to “connect climate justice and social justice.” “There is no difference anymore between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world.”
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red bandanas, advertised solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong and Jakarta have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not taught compulsory in the terminale (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four hours and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, on the whole, a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued, stressing: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged about the lack of historical-geographic education in the terminals at technical lyceums."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography education in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended teacher education reform, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday’s protest against the project, which they believe is a victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in the Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-related aptitude test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission exam, during which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as a teacher in the internship.
He went on to say, “Adding all the internships offered before the performance exam will bring you even more hours you spent in front of the students, that is, more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He once again confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to overcome on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something that will reach people and make them feel like they want to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the sidelines of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Among the experts, twenty participants were selected, also according to their charism," he said.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely in front of about 50 people only with the help of films.
“This is part of our role as a scientist,” he stressed in the hope that listeners may learn that “the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier.”
The videos from these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
Prisoners’ unions on Friday called for a general day of action to ensure that premiums and overtime, whose pay has been postponed for budget reasons until January, are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Prison Officials ("FO-Penitentiaires") called on employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and block it in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is due to them".
The 3rd Union of Prison Officials ("CGT-Penitentiaires") called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surcharges and the Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is branded as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first prison union, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for “general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger.”
The head of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice communicated in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the prison officials, guaranteeing that the payment will take place next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of staff to keep our penal system functioning and modernize it," the Justice Minister said in the letter.
“I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of overtime, does not repeat itself in the future,” Ms. Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore scarce, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP / UNSA, for which the "household constraints" must be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces that it will boycott “all assemblies and convocations” until new instructions are issued.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours from October to December are still unpaid, and the same applies to their overtime," the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without hiring more staff, the attempt to enrich ourselves with staff funds is more than inappropriate,” said the Bordeaux CGT trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama thinks he’s distributing Christmas gifts that are always better than he gets himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family for the first time in the White House, has talked to TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is giving out better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special show broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog of course also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama resolutely rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts: “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she annoys the president.
"So please," he insulted her, pointing to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you these?"
During this one-hour airing in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television host, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember when my father visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball,” the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
“I didn’t know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday Operates Again, RTL Confirms He Has Been Put Into Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was operated again at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday night after U.S. doctors found “damage resulting from surgery for a disc incision” he suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that the damage required a new operation.
The singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available at the latest in 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that the patient had a little more certainty about the condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it emerges from certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The surgery, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
Following Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection following the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley", but he assured that there was no need to worry about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, concern for the singer’s health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, it was widely reported that Johnny Hallyday had “small colorectal cancer surgery,” which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
However, since then, every health problem has been extensively commented on, and fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer struggled to move on stage.
It wasn’t until mid-November that the people around him had to deny re-admission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet on his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, when polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m positions and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m-freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec.,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in getting bigger and bigger and in this case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which were banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which began in the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t set a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S. tomb plate at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tomb that appeared with French writer Emile Zola was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the third century AD and has always been valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble depicting "four scenes of Dionysus in a sophistical architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece; there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, Sotheby's Vice President for Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what buyers have so far offered the most for," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, minister in the Third French Republic and president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible after the move by the coup government had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a phone call last night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibility of carrying out this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the plane, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring Mr. Zelayas, had returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and request political asylum for him abroad.
The ousted president, however, declined to do so as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcomed, serving head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by pushing me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has already lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, interior minister of the coup administration, told HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, would only make him president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelayas leaving had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the ousted president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had increased its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day of the popular poll he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Cogress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, with the US trade balance showing a price recovery in the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to IPO figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has risen from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from different industries, judged Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-glasses", she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
The analysts, on the other hand, had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen in the past week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average number of new job seekers over the past four weeks has fallen “to the low of the year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds for 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% on Tuesday night, the profitability of bonds for 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans whistle "Ladies in White" out
Hundreds of Cuban power-bearing partisans on Thursday whistled the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally that temporarily arrested a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "ladies in white", wives or close political prisoners, were whistled on open streets by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on a march to the center of the capital to demand the release of the political prisoners, a journalist of AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans chanted with a raised fist towards the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to “guarantee their protection.”
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place the night before in Havana, in which there were neither injuries nor arrests.
In Havana’s Vedado district, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who were also making their way to the demonstration in front of International Human Rights Day on Thursday, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced dissidents wrought by the partisans of the government to enter civilian vehicles using force.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the list of dissidents has about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been held behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression, by European or American NGOs.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife, leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday late in the afternoon and injured five others.
According to the first information from the interview, the 28-year-old attacker injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures for a hitherto unexplained cause, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is subjected to the consequences of his injuries, according to an official of the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he pre-knocked a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, roughly in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life as, according to police sources, he has apparently been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who, according to police reports, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped onto the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He allegedly injured two other passers-by, apparently accidentally: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of which was heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he wore crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including teenagers, are said to have tried to tame the insane, according to witness reports from the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties wearing a green vest.
Three young men tried to intervene.
They didn’t make it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, according to police.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby came to me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, put her in a first aid position, and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by cuts.
State police officers finally arrested the man who did not carry identification papers.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Office of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out that he will be admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were ordered to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been abducted.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the tather procession".
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for a new stop to law enforcement
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial in his residence in Switzerland for a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "pianist", has denounced gross trial errors at the time of negotiation in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California.
I immediately demand punishment, Mr. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, commissioned with the case at the time of the trial, "leaved a cold back."
According to him, the now-deceased judge, Rittenband, before he delivered his verdict, had discussed it with a prosecutor who was said to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: pursued and coveted), especially by the prosecutor in question David Wells.
Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lyed" the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel asks for the conduct of a trial that would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the charges brought against the accused cannot be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the U.S. in 1978 before the penalty was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to attend the trial.”
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
“The filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises its authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that “there are other escape alternatives.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the end of prosecution of Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded once again the abolition of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise in the dollar and closes without price.
On Friday, the New York Stock Exchange closed priceless in a market that was torn back and forth between better-than-foreseen indicators and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures, available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains tightly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators that “helped to improve the market outlook for the solidity of the economy’s recovery,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, U.S. consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s index preview.
However, the indices have been slowed by a further rise in the dollar price, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing “the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, the technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond rose by 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492 % on the previous day.
Election of Miss World in South Africa
After a month-long tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and watch it in front of a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already earned their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true whirlwind of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn was just extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone enthusiastically.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m. (3 p.m. Central European time).
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it’s every woman’s dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India smiles with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
Candidates defilate in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuits.
The presentation will be presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with an almost unbeatable warmth and pride, assured Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, went on a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and tasted the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Her most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote for this event a little more.
I'm dealing with people I'm probably never going to get close to.
“I’m sure I’ll be back to the 2010 World Cup,” said Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he got out of the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 pm local time (9 pm CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would "quickly" go to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a subsequent bacterial infection after surgery on a disc hernia on November 26.
The singer was put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a subsequent bacterial infection following a disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes resulting from the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event Friday morning at the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer said.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had carried out the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
“I’ve heard that there may be going to be a trial,” he said.
According to Jean-Claude Camus, Johnny Hallyday “traveled too quickly with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles.”
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already had two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he told RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic milieu.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Chamber of Physicians, has described him as "a man without scruples" who has to be "regularly" accountable before the board of doctors and "anything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfect" and the post-operative investigations were "normal".
“The operation did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage,” he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been increasing since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is a bit too scarce for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise) party becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem party, on Friday reacted violently to an attempt to take over the seal, the once-founded party of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from Nouveau Centre party chairman Hervé Morin, urging him, under the threat of judicial prosecution, to no longer use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, by the way, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To underscore his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claims ownership of the UDF trade mark because he was the first to apply for this trade mark at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance, supervised by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and set a deadline for the Minister and the MP, under threat of judicial prosecution, to no longer use this seal and to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to it.
You have made numerous declarations in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to “take over” the UDF seal, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and the centrist alliance’s Senator Jean Arthuis.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement, Nouveau Centre+, the slogan of today’s UDF+, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, and urges NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the ownership rights of the trademark to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will take action against you to uphold the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that “UDF” has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends “made the choice” to leave this in 2007 to found a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the party “UMP”.
The party Nouveau centre therefore has no right, according to the signatories, to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem party as well as the establishment of a branch to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time he applied for the brand name" but of the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the absence of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
You also point out that this ruthlessness is on the way to turning into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, in politics as well as in life, more dignified to make a name for ourselves than to try to get out of anonymity by acquiring, in a fraudulent way, a name that you have no legal claim to".
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier sentenced for exploiting weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the 80-year-olds to sneak away part of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be held accountable on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness in court, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair, worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are grabbing themselves while at the same time having the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical investigation of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L’Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday should submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which they clearly announce whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, said Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
Regarding the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he affirmed.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to sneak away donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas led to a major family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer referred to three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers.
Liliane Bettencourt added: “Please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since her marriage.”
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office is again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge in the last few days has rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in her place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s representative.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" determines the best as it was formerly to impose on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to separate products factors impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization negatively affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more crucially, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) “demands from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking perspective”; it demands from employees a commitment that is completely contradicted by the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operational revolution that would consist of placing employees at the centre of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very limited benefits of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its payees, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally gets to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
Her interpretation of psychology is mechanical, derived from the major engineering schools.
Through intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and has been unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the “lever” (sic) for employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, strengthens executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the payees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and plans.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a predetermined Doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, corporate leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is conducive to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo Speech: The “Fair War” Brings Praise to Obama from the Right
U.S. rights welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives who ridiculed the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the subject of a “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
War, of course, is the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, rejoiced the former Speaker of the House, who especially acknowledged the reference to “the existence of evil in the world” in Obama’s words.
In some parts, I felt this speech was historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The previous congressman, seen by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a “president of the left” who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they “could not be free and could not hand over a price for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition to portraying himself as a “cosmopolitan” as “he always does,” he has “spoken like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live like in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for the protection of,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, high-spirited and uninspired."
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama is defending the recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, you can easily justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praiseworthy on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was given early to Obama, called the speech itself a “monumentary work” for a speaker like him known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo “provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” according to the California daily.
The New York Times believes that Obama “announced the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Distance driving: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike order and the looming severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hopes of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 p.m. was the agreement signed.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "there was concern that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“That’s not a lot, but we’re starting small,” said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers anymore.
"There will probably always be some rebels who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot called it a “good deal,” although it was “difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition.”
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high pay groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said it was an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the total state for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular make it possible to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of employers' taxes in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill on corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for an "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to that organization and then to apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assured.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to annoy the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the association Otre, the agreement "threatens to shed a large grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the coming 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
Disruptions on the RER A line, France’s largest high-speed rail network for the greater Paris area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the unions and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), left strikers waiting with their demands for wage surcharges.
There were no trains on this important shopping weekend before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line only one of four trains were ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travelers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP strives to connect the major stores in terms of traffic technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains operated on schedule during peak time, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As already on Thursday, there was no turmoil on the platforms, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adapted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), declared that he had been extra "a half an hour earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want: According to Thierry Garon (South), they demand a long-due salary surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself was putting its salary surcharge proposals in parentheses, stressing that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a new meeting was planned for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company “ignores the weekend drivers”.
In the morning, about 150 drivers sought the location of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership who had so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after calming down the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an advance announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (USA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and they also lament the deterioration of the working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a salary surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", according to the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political event for a period of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, which Turk and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the Party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders expressed that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet like partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has “no connection” to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court lies in between the government, which seeks to respond to the Kurdish community and proposes a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to put an end to the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water launchers as the protesters started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court’s decision would “deepen despair even further.”
“Turkey cannot resolve this (Kurdish, editorial note) issue on the basis of a party ban,” he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We oppose in principle the closure of the parties.
That doesn’t solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedo against the democratic opening promoted by the government,” said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
"You can obviously be prepared for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Rather, so that its employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes with large-scale scattering vehicles are driven off, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main roads and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire department accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1,040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it doesn’t snow until 7.30 am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattered vehicles."
Only then, if it does not snow further, are the access and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, the turn.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES’s pedestrians set out on their way, with priority being given to clearing danger points and transitions.
The FES can usually not take care of all the cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 pm to 4:30 am, says Brauburger.
Since there is a rapid smoothness, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa findae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-long animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body traits, Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relative relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassics, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Discovery confirms theories about early dino history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurus fossils from the Triassics are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is often controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and also the birds, which are known as "long-necked" lizards, the four-legged lizards belonging to the tripods and their relatives, and the plants of fres.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa findae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hav<0xC3><0xAD>ae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the birds breathe more efficiently than the mammals.
In the case of Tawa findae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestors of the two groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America to all parts of the world, which at that time still formed a single landmass as a supercontinent Pangea.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa findae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods speaks for itself.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could arise, because in South America, a lot of primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare lateral line of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still enigmatic.
During the Triassic period, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying saurians and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic era, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while their relatives died on the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to bloom, which had also developed in the Triassic period and had since eaten a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley, California, are on the lookout.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the education strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damages did not justify “the forcible dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command.”
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the contents.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the property damage, it says.
Legitimated protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Federation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the Unipräsident and the police.
We are grateful to the president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, according to Peter Beuth, a member of the CDU’s parliament.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have emptied.
The Left has submitted a request asking the Interior Minister to give a report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had already established contacts with the Frankfurt science center Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow’s Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and planning chief Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be able to take a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "Socialist Plan City" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hillside landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the submerging of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into heinous construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered to be 19th-century traffic-technical fossils, which acted as brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took an enormous amount of time to turn locomotives from the rear to the front.
Go in, keep short, continue driving - that's how it should be.
And that’s why the headliners should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – that’s why the slogan of the “Heart of Europe” is used.
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost inexpensive in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement the lowering.
However, head lifts no longer have a problem of entry and exit, since there are modern turntable trains with train vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 together with the ICE line to Ulm is now being tackled.
Local and state politicians have done it.
The railway participates, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic bear the taxpayers and not the state group.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be somewhat justified.
New urban space is being created, which - believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger transport, which was attributed - typically in the 1980s - to huge growth.
At that time, there was no competition from the low-cost airliners.
Modern transport policy, however, must first and foremost focus on strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to strong inclines.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects as well.
Approximately six billion euros are to be budged in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and constraints in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built in slow motion.
It would be imperative to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines verdict on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in review.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally examined, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had written on this day that the country had to reinstate the night flight ban in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided by the state government, is not compatible with the protection of the population from nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether to go against the verdict in review.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged government representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban, otherwise it would be considered a "break of the word".
It’s damn hard to keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP election slogan, “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch dismissed Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is trying to get to its night flights with "right-wing distortion and trickery".
A thorough legal examination will take your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition puts it, his group’s statements on the night flight ban had never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden U.S. major banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp bailout fund in a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) at a stroke.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup also plans to reimburse the state aid.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions that have been associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from its own cash register, which was well-filled, among other things, by divisional sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday evening expressed his thanks to the American taxpayer: The injection of money has helped through a very difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the financial house was closed with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to relieve it of its liabilities to the state.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back their aid.
Quick choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the staff.
A favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Capital Studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially, so as not to precede the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage ZDF intendant Markus Schächter, should this proposal not pass through to the Board of Directors either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter’s proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years failed on the board of directors.
Only seven members voted for Brender and seven voted against him. Brender's de-election was a bitter defeat for Schächer, but an expected one.
The majority in the board of directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition was organized against the editor-in-chief of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under Brender, the ZDF news broadcasts had lost ratings, he rejected another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Recently, even 35 state law activists had meddled in the debate, which considered Koch’s action unconstitutional.
It wasn't useful.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that, he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morning Magazine"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF-Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brenders, who was still elected journalist of the year by the industry newspaper Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart in the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should amend the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a wise move - by sharply criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächer was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as to elect the board of directors, without being suspected of bringing a party supporter to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left-liberals anyway.
Study will be defused
Partial success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally drew in on Thursday: At a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Rectors of Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
In the future, students should be able to cope with their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable measure" is ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the ministers of culture and university rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled for the first time with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Each module usually completes with only one examination", says a 30-page paper, which is to partially re-regulate the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction of the examination load", said the chairman of the accreditation council, Reinhold Grimm, a "development of errors that significantly impaired the studyability should be stopped."
In addition, "studyability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" to see if "unnecessary constraints on students' choice of
Events would be avoided.
The students would have "aspiration to receive leeway that enables and promotes self-initiative."
The rules should apply to the admission of new courses of study, but also to the review of existing courses of study.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, which means that it will take until 2015 for all courses of study to be reviewed.
Responsible for this are ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the authority of the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the stockpile was not too large and the audit regime was not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are mainly to set up tutoring programs and strengthen student counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
The state and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a amendment to the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
After this, only one exam is required for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies is to be more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and facilitating access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country will be checked for studyability.
The government and opposition had again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest, after the educational strikes, the students as affected should now also "speak a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper on Thursday.
The Bonn decisions did not go far enough for the Trade Union Education and Science (GEW) as a whole: it demands a legal entitlement that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access to a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient master’s degree places with the best possible study conditions are available tomorrow for today’s generation of bachelor students, according to GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into and out of Germany is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he themes in disturbing speech fragments the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost his language.
Born in Banat in Romania in 1951, Werner Söllner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a editor in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University in 1993, and since 2002 he has been the director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extraliterary stir during a conference in Munich last Tuesday, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and tear mirrors of its security records".
Apparently, Söllner was unsure and embarrassed to read a statement in which he admitted to Romanian-German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts to recruit had started sneaking, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted enough against attempts to intimidate the Securitate."
Lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and understatement of a political system based on surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter had played a role, according to Söllner’s confession of the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "hooked him out" in all points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, however, completely surprising is the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may suspect, will be speculated and in some cases probably also knew what name was hidden behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike in the case of the Stasi files, which are now very procedurally secure in this country, the handling of the remains of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic enlightenment has been undermined and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS) was not established until 1999, but the issuance of the files has been slow since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview proved that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar spoke derisively about the laureate.
She had a psychosis, after all, she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, as is so often the case of Söllner in connection with concealed guilt, unavoidable questions arise.
The wise reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Champions League Champions League Champions League
It looked like a well-dressed salesman was coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, climbed a quarter of an hour after midnight into a called C-Class. <0xCC><0x88>
The man with the distinctive baldness was chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or really get going.
In the words of the Swiss, who had only committed three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the daily life of the league.
And to stop the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw (disambiguation)
The Champions League round of 16 (Hinspiele 16/17 + 23/24 February/Hinspiele 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy over the brilliant appearance of Babbel’s successor thus remained subdued.
Not only the supposed rescuer, who had given the insecure Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy in the short period of time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained soul plumber Gross the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under the therapist Babbel.
Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann admitted that “if a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that one would not have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new supervisor: "He is a man who takes through and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
Above all, VfB Stuttgart needs consistency.
As Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a weakened substitute and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later the evil awakening had arrived in Leverkusen at 0:4, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal has been achieved, the other is still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not ready to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly revived in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, countered Heron’s harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Also that his free day had been removed after games, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and dislike.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure egoism", Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a large share of the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup Fight in Heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judges’ decision was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in the heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion according to the WBC version defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
It was Klitschko's third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to endure the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02-metre-long Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left leadership hand.
The eleven inches smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly escaped the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively achieve his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the laps.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who walked with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had provided some vortices before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was provoked to push Johnson’s sunglasses off his nose “to see his eyes.”
Fourth win after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up before without a fight.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in his title defenses and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and I am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had reasoned the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the Associations WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13 meter tall Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously canceled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotional company is reportedly already planning to fight Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are calling for information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - Following the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious deception.
The minister had said about the deadly bombardment of two tanker trucks in September "knowingly the untruth", Greens group leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
It’s called a lie: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Defence Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the abducted vices, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, as many as 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s Office had no influence on the Bundeswehr’s concrete operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the ministry’s presentation about the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially it had said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials reported that they had even referred the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the situation, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
So far, he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Federal Parliament's Committee of Inquiry, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in mentally ill people and drug addiction that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to indulge unrestrained in the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in waking, seeing and hearing things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, at least as specialties.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill or in drug addiction.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality.
Dreamlikely altered waking states can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the new-age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain's neural messengers - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dreaming in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of being irrational to dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, sensualities".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. transforms into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devilish figures with blood-red, distorted frats, gnashing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the loop around his neck.
- Jump.
The sling's loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices shout in a drum-fell-splintering choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, besides he is manic-depressed, he is taking medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The misconceptions are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer world, they end up in an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution delusions.
Particularly common is voice listening - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person is no longer able to separate the important from the unimportant, the brain is no longer able to filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that stem from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Physician at the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he is overwhelmed by the events, just like in a dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible to them, the misconceptions are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Once in my life I had a hallucination.
Unlike in dreams, Fuchs says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, basically remains."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats capriolen, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can cause any person to temporarily lose the reference to reality, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the determining factors alone.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system occurs, which also initially does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis when the disposition is present.
Even hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains run hot
The crazy thing is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether misconceptions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of viewpoint.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and illusions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, Kasten says, are made up of memory contents that are usually held back.
They occur when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or underinhibited; when our brain runs hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulation withdrawal, stress, love distress or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren’t pictures and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a lazy boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other misconceptions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the misconceptions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher is introducing a new student in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations, both audible and visible to everyone else, on the board.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the frats or the girl with the bloody cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell her anything about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist box on the internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from stimulation withdrawal, they are very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then underworked and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a young girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she calls Dad, since she can think, is not her biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between misconceptions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nocturnal dream pictures value caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their misconceptions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
In our too conscious world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also harbors positive, creative things - delusion is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme trauma or disease-related situations, for example in polyradiculate patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self-loss and world-loss, for example, by persistent, complete incapacity for movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since coping with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of foundation and meaning in a situation that is in itself unbearable, which allows us people's own ability to design, not to sink into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body in the intensive care unit is condemned to motionlessness.
Claussen dives into a self-made world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among nobles who made intoxicants from blood.
After being kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle into his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It goes completely on in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in incidental details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life-worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug addiction show how brittle our inner images of outer reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes Kasten, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have arranged the details of this as a precautionary measure.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from his presidency in January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
The treasury division later added responsibility for the company’s assets and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, also responsibility for direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from the downfall: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought they could thus rise to the very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had “never had world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’ either, these shops have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal .
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has set up, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
In the spa area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide hair removal with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, in addition there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen, which is located opposite the devices.
Afterwards, different videos will show you how to do your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching) is completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And then, after training your body, if you still want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered to restore the beauty, shine and health of your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 am to 22.00 pm 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our closet.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative that Endesa is participating in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, prophesied of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of calm".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled once again the measures that the Government initiated in support of the automotive sector during the year of government.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have today a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a highly competitive industry in the future, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Total Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), provided €800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided for investments of more than €3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models, as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automobile manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the exhaust gases of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportsmanship
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is completely compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stopping and starting system of the engine in the Mazda3 model, named i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good marks in the overall picture.
The finishing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are “very good” in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive in comfort.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
Until now, the stop and start system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gear shifting and low fuel consumption, even though Mazda’s diesel models are the best-selling especially.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the standard equipment stands out above all the assistant for lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-Blue.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative of this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the model Sportive tested.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest level of driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red tapestry of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shined more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without being able to see certain attachments or surf the internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is nevertheless of interest especially to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone’s flat rate.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one designed only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite in contrast to the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was unveiled yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read his emails as soon as you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for all of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) can offer these types of rates means that phone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering various ways they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other inquiries on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without hook.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely at the time of purchase, and not month after month.
And that is exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish paint of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and to do this she wore a bit of large embroidery or a necklace.
It even went so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a smooth model, but gold.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised on this occasion as a hair wreath, the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they perform.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half a day or do not have a permanent employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed position, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed employment receive their first child, on average, only 3.7 years after the marriage, a number that rises to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have not realized their marriage and the first child until much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a large influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of the willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of the women during the marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the education level, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years old, depending on whether they only have primary school graduation or higher education, were on average mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 each for the first time.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a major degree get married before their first permanent employment and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly differently and first seek a permanent employment and marry after that and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its ever-envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous celebrity as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have to speak an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On that occasion, they all appeared.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and their daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asses" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three <0xCE><0xB2> x-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an affinity to the burning heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares no fear or enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read over and over again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "In reading its pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt it without having found words for it: Joy as opposed to the unfortunate fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, without any sense, like the knife blade that would almost have killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery merged with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, you have to climb the north wall, the wall on which the best climbers try again and again.
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane cry that was shouted from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary way. He did this during a journey, on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence before the worms.
Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb are engraved these verses of Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort, / after the thunderstorm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death. "
About Virginia Wolf: “She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied on her among the Azalea or sang the birds in Greek.
No other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness.
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroya to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did he do, except to destroy the glory of that man, that he might stand himself on this platform?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran out next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed animal that we have brought out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then from the clear sky they gave him two kicks and injured him hard.
Our indignation cannot be put into words at all, because it is incomprehensible to us, because since the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to reprimand these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will help at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation over what happened prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what has to be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “includes far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming more and more safe every day,” and further reaffirmed that it also contributes to bringing this goal one step closer every day with other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on motorcycles, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase, in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely for the reason that it is always committed to being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, which must be one of its main objectives the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are on the rise again
After almost two years, the car market for vans is finally starting to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac manufacturer’s association and the Ganvam car dealer’s association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
However, apart from the increase last month, the total admissions for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunderstorms are still in the sky that affect demand the most, because although some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100% of cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
These constraints, which are the result of the bank’s spinning of money, need to be addressed by other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support has helped little when buying a vehicle of the plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a van of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Car Dealer Association predicts a similar year for 2010 as in the past, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system back then, and as is the case now with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary braking systems in emergencies must become an obligatory feature in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a leave of absence has been set until the end of February 2011.
The action adopted by the European Union is aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the braking force carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not have to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked at full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force into the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are injured could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistance.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver reacts, the system helps him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already unavoidable, the brake assistant exerts maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel to January
While the workforce at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected side to give its approval on every single point of the plan already in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
GM said it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If none of these buyers were to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now brings only 1,275 kilos on the scale.
To achieve this, they first dispensed with the automatic fold-up roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, so that 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model like those of the GT3, another 15 "disappear"; by removing the air conditioner again 13; in addition, the fuel tank was slightly reduced by 54 times; and, in addition, the fuel tank was slightly reduced by 64.
Then, the CDR-30 audio system had once again been omitted from six kilos less and the missing kilo had been achieved by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was conducted with a 6-speed manual transmission vehicle, mainly on the smaller land streets of California, on mountain tracks that were really very winding.
In its driving behavior, it can only be given the impeccable note.
However, the reduction in his weight has not led to the fact that he would no longer be so safely on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives you a feeling of great safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the necessary time, until we give him the commands to race, brake, recover and then again to get everything out of his engine...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do along the entire route; and that, although we found ice in the morning at some of these curves and roll split in the morning.
In summary, it can be said that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is usually rather rare and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
The singer, a busty friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra, thus coming to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight times the best of his team in the rating (29).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant losses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the blues, who sat at the top of the scoreboard from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come on the field with well warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for a home game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the "minus six" rating of Splitter already presumed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the continually attacking "hand of El<0xC3><0xAD>as" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in making the "yellows" turn the wheel (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with certainty of touch to get air again and in one of them came suddenly the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, that on the scoreboard could again be shown calming distance of (54-67) of the host with the end of the 67, the
The Alavesens were blocked in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they honestly deserved in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team did not and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and despite the fact that splitters were put off because of fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and had to resign the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and that in a game characterized by the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the indoor game, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The Malaga team was neither afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians were able to start dreaming with an aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinding the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, even though the local team with an indoor game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to get the scoreboard in their favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which it would have been almost disqualified due to an action between the two Americans Beverley and Williams.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks at the Unicaja.
Among their players on the field and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible.
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, who were superior despite their 19 losses and even managed to offset the difference of the game played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to ignore the many failures and the departure of the Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, thanks to the spring guidance and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57 in the 31st minute.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, once he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket range, was not to be braked.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and had to resign the lead to Olympiacos.
How Much Should You Earn From Your Facebook Profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, learn their salary that they should earn based on their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job vacancies available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form on Facebook to enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application became available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels badly paid", explains Albert Ribera, responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the lowest paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the United Kingdom and France.
A British programmer receives a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11.592 euros per year net, followed by the work of a salesman with 14.725 euros and that of a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, if his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" must have left before that date the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he will have to look for a new place to stay."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed because Zelaya refused to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician whom the "de facto" government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to pay off the debts with the direct purchase of assets and, indirectly, to give free rein to liquidity at interest rates of around zero, so that the banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to sprinkle some sand in the gear, as the ECB has already done with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors are doubting the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debts were rising again.
The US, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain has so far hardly been affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a new downward revision regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain amount of uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to create an awareness among those responsible for world economic policy of what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects that led to the loss of jobs by restricting loans, when they should have started a new day of thanksgiving.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai hints at a tribal war between the emirates to restore power in the emirates, and development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government that hides the national debt, elections, and a new government that pulls along the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro-member country to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery to too high amounts, that would now be within expectations.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in national debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, should the European differences diminish and the Spanish continue to increase, then this would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, despite the OECD and the European Commission, which again do not promise a long-lived Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment "be careful when driving".
Connected branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave some key points to the press about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest €50 billion by 2020 and another €60 billion from that date until 2030, on the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisite of course by other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, in no way wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, in spite of some" individual "measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola referred to, there is a clear focus on this direction.
In any case, Galán believes that the decisions on investments should already be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable compensation framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial receives Aer Lingus ‘handling’ at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, on which no figures have been announced so far, is set to last for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to study energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A five-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city council wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the Administration has decided on Public-Private Cooperation (PPP) to advance the project according to a business plan prepared by Ernst & Young, the Administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other in the last phase.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues group, is competing against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is in the shortlist, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises enormous construction and privatization, but has a hurdle to overcome, since you can only get access by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona focuses on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
It already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies tasked with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll line, promoted by the City of Brisbane's Office of Infrastructure and named Northern Link (Northern Towong) has the purpose of connecting the western Toowong highway with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through Brisbane tunnels, the largest of which is the road to the dam.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the funding.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is repeatedly awarding substantial contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government in the amount of 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane, construction has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives order for 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC has secured through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising status from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for a sum of about three million euros per year, the railway company said.
The contract also provides for the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies presenting for this Renfe competition, 4 of which came into the final round, including TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
France Télécom has been fined over $63 million for slowing down competition.
France’s competition regulator has imposed a fine of €63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean territories.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for handicapping its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased as the competition watchdog believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore relapsed again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenues from businesses that do not derive from the telephone connection.
Basically, this ownership website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 until this seven will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has earned Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a 476.4 million since the start.
The Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for football clubs since its inception in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million since then, earning them the third and fifth place in the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club ranks third in Europe, earning the most money from its participation and the only one to win the trophy three times apart from AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is fifth.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money from their participation in the past Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to cash in through the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four bids Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distributed
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated procedure for the allocation of funds used by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA is providing €413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received €2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for a participation received 3.8 million for their mere presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that came to the round of 16 will receive three million each; the four that came to the quarter-finals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four will each receive $4 million.
The winner earns $9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives $5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
In addition, however, there are the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-placed and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has leaked details of the offer to buy shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be paid out over ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at €1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuvan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a period of 15 days to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company confirmed Ruiz Mateos that it had come into contact with the Authority.
With a closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of potential purchase offers and the court disputes of his ex-managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jordá as Head of Internal Accounting.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but uncontroversial because the company is involved in a legal battle over suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will be shifting further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar’s credit, yesterday the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly, confirming that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destiny.
CNMV approves the public exclusion tender of Paternina submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender for Federico Paternina submitted by investment company Mer on October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it had approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were in accordance with the legally binding laws and that the content of the explanatory memorandum submitted could therefore be considered "sufficient" according to the amendments made last December 2.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn constitutes 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of EUR 6,142,786 in shares registered on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and the price of which has been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New Vehicle Assessment Programs
In these days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are transported to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage and repair costs.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That’s why almost 100% of appraisers use these types of systems.
Accident assessment and repair service and application providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process it thereafter and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera Group, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing in the tool market for review and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex’s sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is getting bigger and bigger, to the point that more versions, variants and engines have come to the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because every single one of the one thousand vehicle parts has to be catagolicized and its price entered.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is created from each model, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a much-selling model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
More than 99% of the vehicle fleet on the roads.
For the purpose of carrying out documentation work and creating databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways, thus offering different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the partial or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to inform about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By looking through the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each report.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it, at most ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, any insurance company that produces thousands of reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line only by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market that can be used for vehicles that have been declared a total damage.
Their statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses, or obtaining information about brand and model deviations.
It can be used, for example, to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimates, which is also intended for appraisers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT-Guide for Opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and sales in 2008 amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Solera Group’s total worldwide sales (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auctioning accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a Plattfom online for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the other 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This appraisal and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
Founded in 1996 in Germany, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added on the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deactivated may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value can be re-registered, even if they have been deregistered after difficult official procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the working hours, surcharges or discounts and then he can have the cost estimate printed and passed on to his customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for appraisal like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and then you can completely turn the image to look at the inside.
