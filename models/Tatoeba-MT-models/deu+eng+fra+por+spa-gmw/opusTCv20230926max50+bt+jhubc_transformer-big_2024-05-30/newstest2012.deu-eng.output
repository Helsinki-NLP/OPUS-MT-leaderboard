No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko had been convicted, as part of a amendment to the Penal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned Minister of Expression, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the motion for a reduction in penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the convicted will be tried in court in December.
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the process raised the suspicion of the court’s bias.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Expression was sentenced, from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Only the winners have yet to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the customary law of the Shari'a, of which one now has a certain conception with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft one chops off one’s hand in a nutshell.
Women, too, should quickly forget thoughts of emancipation, possible faith apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur’an from tribes of mutual adversity.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that would hardly be conceivable in this country and, above all, would hardly be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best and would hardly suit the aforementioned Libyans.
In this sense, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the unbelieving dogs at all.
The only excuse for this is the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a change of gunfire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians quit in the person of a political ally’s dictator, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to avoid a military occupation of Libya.
This leaves the locals a concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But do the petroleum companies also get the black gold at the mockery price without occupation?
It is hardly possible, and so the West can at last rightly boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If not, it will destroy the Shari'a representatives.
Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm died through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, with Germany and France increasing.
But the bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and a number of other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5% and France’s by 0.4%.
Both countries at the same time corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slowing growth in economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated figures, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the eurozone as a whole and in the EU, the economy grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy has shrunk by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are starting to feel problems...
The return on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, there are loud voices that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the toughest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper <0xC4><0x8C>ech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football has thus been able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascension game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech national team also won 1-0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant <0xC4><0x8C>ech's and the hero of the day Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek in Montenegro and thus redeemed their ticket for the football European Championship.
They were also able to put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half because of the precise defensive game of the Czech team.
The bad guys of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will participate in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that the domestic football will receive a premium of about 200 million euros.
From the first few minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined lengthy and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team remained and the wide shots in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program from a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the building at noon on Tuesday and then announced their death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a lively shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
With this, they wanted to announce that they are ready to protect their country’s core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack with the intent to cripple Iran’s nuclear program to the greatest extent, the Israeli press says that the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan’s attack target would be from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of an obese child: it does not eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with being overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which a person grows and the examples that surround him is for the healthy development of a person.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the education campaign under the motto "obesity is not a coincidence".
In families with thick children, sport is not exactly one of the favorite occupations, but what also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place towards the end of the school year last year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is not a coincidence" campaign, which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy eating and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“For example, only half of the children surveyed said they ate breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesser-evening bread five times a day – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of students eat breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
Worst of all, one in ten families doesn’t eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy fries are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do – only 15 percent.
Make your own menu
A further part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own diet from the options offered according to appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flours, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet sodas," the final report on this survey stresses.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, dough products won just before poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Back to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the conclusion of the enlightening lecture 'Obesity is not a coincidence', there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project said.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a little cheered that this was a bit too much fabric to start with.
I had no idea what was yet to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, dressing up problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still full.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not a single man on the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, these are most of us.
Some have a neck that is too short, others a figure that is too young with no neat curves, and others are molly.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal wide shoulders, lengthen the neck, or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman like Jennifer Lopez - i.e. with a large bust, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figurative without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or trousers really don’t fit, you should have at least one piece tailor-made.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one that always slips up and out of the waist, etc.
Young figures can in turn afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, clasps, applications, embroidery or trim.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my mind.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve given the task of homework.
Each of the students was given a celebrity for whom she should devise suitable outfits - daywear and evening gown.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his type of figure.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally, than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (well, that is a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search on the internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design is to be expressed.
It is also very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us about this.
But this isn't until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about character types, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And sent stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, like a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the bare body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and immediately the whole look looks very different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But most of the advice came to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
“Then you can hurt them first,” Jakub said.
I finally understand why we have to poke up all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often get to see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> also confirmed that image and style sometimes make up half of the success.
All you need to do is look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something, as I look like, is secondary).
And if someone of us can already be styled, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to impose on us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate especially with the people he styles and he has to be a keen psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing by their opinion.
“If any manager orders us to look at her closet and add some pretty pieces, we can’t clean up the whole closet and say, ‘My God, that’s awful.’”
"You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things that you recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must include.
So such a bag that you can button on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, hair-removal rollers or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are rimmed at the back, if it is not too large (stitched needles or other tampers are not allowed).
So that we can not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to properly glue shoes underneath.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, not to mention the outside.
We were glued and glued...
You should not even touch the shoes with the scissors, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned above is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - devoting oneself to styling at a professional level is no child’s play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The originally carefree ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettantic mistakes to the routine ride to the early shift.
Although it has succeeded in fulfilling the ambitions to a large extent, but what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before it came to the tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to move the already aged "Need for Speed" game series back to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the passages where the main protagonist gets out of the car and walks on.
But as you’re used to at NFS, in the end it’s a lot different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, one is introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit at the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on another track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t have the impression that the game will always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still quite beautiful to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But driving through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, unusual elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be hellishly careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are built in quite a succession.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then there is another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack escapes from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (perhaps only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the game, because this element at least has no chance of getting boring - it belongs in the context of the aforementioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from the point of view of today, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not say that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But for action-packed racing, the local driving model is still quite good, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only appear after a certain period of time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea before any impact on any object how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When narrowly overtaking or passing by oncoming cars, in some places you "strip" the other car only easily, but in others, almost identical situations, you get into a sling and spin wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter any more, but it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted them, everything goes from scratch.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, there is nothing else than learning the critical section from the head.
It is very unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some corners in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere, "civil" cars are always in the same configuration, whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing two cars in front of you, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again here regardless of the timing.
At the craziest, this is the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent has to overtake one here obviously on devil come out.
And if he is in front of you, then of course he takes your sight away, so that you drive your own car a few times in Klump at the beginning.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that’s a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so full of action that you almost don’t know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn’t matter what “fault” it is – the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the races.
You should not overlook the petrol stations on the track, because it is here that you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the mountain serpentines.
Goes hand in hand with the game story mode also the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
There are not only medals here, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To reach the higher driver level, different items must be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function Autolog, which among other things compares the results achieved with those of other players and also provides more collective functions.
Another incomprehensible carver is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get by car into a subway tunnel (my way), where you can race long on the rails (my way) in the dark.
On the speedometer, numbers look between 150 and 200 km/h (my way), but there comes suddenly a subway from behind and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
All the more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound playback is OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as wide a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a l<0xC3><0xA0> "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we would have been able to claim with the breast tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game somehow looks unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but you should be prepared for these mistakes with the power of airport headlights to catch your eye.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Charles University
The Festival Festa Academica now offers for the third time the intertwining of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this together with the musical experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty specialist and university choirs introduce themselves.
The focus of the festival is on the two concerts that will take place on November 17.
"The Charles University has a large share in the festival."
"Among the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies, and the Festival Committee also includes the Rector Václav Hampl," said the head of the organisation team, Jakub <0xC4><0x8C>aloun.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist school choirs, which takes place on November 17 from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazzer Karel R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate the World Student Day worthy of commemoration of the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music at the highest level to the public and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague, and Václav Hampl, the rector of the Charles University, took over the patronage of the entire event.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the festival's websites www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negatives and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions tangibly unraveled."
I didn’t expect such a hard war to unleash.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began quite sharply her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also commended the new Permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who wasn't capable of such a role, but I have to say, it took everyone's breath away how well he took on the matter.
“He is a person who manages to patiently listen to, communicate with, and above all has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it in response to the question: who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil quarrels
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda on which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was described as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency, she described as a great negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the ensuing crisis, which has not yet been overcome, has been quite hectic.
And the EU’s seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes it much more complicated because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which economic sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which will be less - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s greyish abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know whether people in Brussels are really crooked or think of round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone really wants to ban us from quarrel?
She would also like to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or a Hungarian comes to me and there's a Slovakian near me, then the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?' and makes a pretty sour look.
According to Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
As much more real than a "European federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want to work together and those that don't want to work together should stand quietly apart."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'", Ms Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, then that would probably be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its foundation.
The foundation for this longevity has already been laid by their first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he advocated the slogan, countless worldwide problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s well-prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking represents a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and succeeded for an entire century because it remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director for the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
In the 1930s, Watson worked as a social care worker in the same way as the entrepreneur Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid vacation, insurance from the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out pay system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
The company was ingenious in talent promotion from the very beginning - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that Palmisan at the helm of IBM will be replaced by a woman next year – by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and has so far held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been conducting so-called online brainstorming, which has resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both internally and externally.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be only present in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue" because of its family name, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or the floppy disk.
At approximately $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you should not be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on various platforms — and if they don’t work, leaving them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies for success
IBM’s profits account for the largest share of services, software and hardware, each one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was the most represented, with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment scope in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis unaffected.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s net profit is growing continuously.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only the values cannot be changed.
This flexible giant can also be expected to cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Spaceflights
Founded one hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It wasn’t until 1924 that the company took the name IBM – originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as the famous punch card clocks for registering the beginning and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competing company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader even overshadowed IBM’s founders – Watson’s ideas are based on the company’s invincible culture and identity to this day.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name suggests, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to checkouts.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled his revenues to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chief chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s technicians and computers helped direct NASA’s flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also to man’s famous flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which set the computer standard of that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the “Smarter Planet” concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned until now, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and city administration.
In the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform, which is designed to help traders guide the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Headquarters is located in Prague and is also home to a world-class research team dedicated to the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) from the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45) became her lover, Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with the patience and she has set herself clear rules for the future.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová, the singer I. Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, offered shelter in her own house, she would not even have dreamed of how it would go with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, even though it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová should leave in the future, then he will surely not receive open arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out.”
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked the back door to him, Josef bears it with dignity so far.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company is still running, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the plot, I'll do the shopping."
"I talk to Darina normally, we just don't share the bed," said J. Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I take all responsibility.
The Worst Female Intuitions: How's It With You?
When men are asked to name some typical feminine indecencies, they always shake some out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines, in which we revisit a few immoralities that let men go through the blood in their veins?
Purchasing
Does your husband accuse you of being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one fight a week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more with promotions?
Then in your case it is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping lust halfway under control.
But hand on heart, what woman can stand it, in search of a well-fitting outerwear, just strolling through a clothing store and not trying out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for the men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do I like you at all?”
Does that sound familiar to them?
Oh, yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it if their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness first
It's a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, scrubbing the tub - and doing so at least twice a week.
Do you insult your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, you reprimand the children because the washbasin just scrubbed is dirty again and because the glass door at the living room closet has fingerprints again, when polishing does so much trouble?
If you suffer from this type of "deviation", then you should know that you should not overdo anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This immeasurable purity can ultimately also damage mutual relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty sneakers come in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it will bring him to the palm.
Of course, that’s not a bad idea, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to gossiping as much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, they are huddled behind their backs or even slandered or you forge alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to peek through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hands on the heart - that's probably all women's.
But this is not to be confused with gossip of the grossest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who are likely to despise everyone in their surroundings and who pose a considerable danger, especially for women’s collectives.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped Philadelphia with their assists to victory
The ice hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jágr had a large share in the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina in the Monday game of the NHL with two assistants and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Benefiting from the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the same game.
After the game, Jágr claimed to journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"Even before the game, I tell him that today he succeeds in a hat trick."
I kind of felt that.”
"Sometimes such a feeling comes over," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek fought the puck behind the Hurricane Gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third, Patrick Dwyer scored a shorthand, but the second third again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I'm not saying he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said.
“I wouldn’t have imagined in life that at the end of my career I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as I would be playing with him.”
"I'm very happy."
“I’m cutting my game to myself.”
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates have adjusted their game to me and now the skewer is turning," Jágr smiled.
Carolina was still playing drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came close to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complications in which he was successful in more than two against one.
"Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last hit of the game from his point of view.
By this victory, Philadelphia placed itself at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defender Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek injured himself in the match against Buffalo and lost in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens lost not only their lead, but also their lead in the 2:3 penalty shootout.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec was unable to transform one of the penalties.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high sickness-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
“We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young players.”
"But there's nothing we can do, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
“With each change, one wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it.”
"We should have made the game easier and had to get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec repelled thirty shots from Tampa Bay, thus contributing to the 5-2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the former <0xC4><0x8C>SSR: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time mainly sold only trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at that time only chosen ones were allowed.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when travel to Yugoslavia was also allowed, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed an so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Already at that time the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was only granted to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without currency commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (western currency) for a trip to the West.
As a result, most of the Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, it is no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation in the neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there at least a few days.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when they traveled to Paris, because who would have already had the money for an accommodation in a hotel or a pension at the time.
A typical feature of foreign travel in the Czech Republic was a trunk packed with canned beer, permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to regularly prepare travel through charter flights, making air travel unbelievably cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating bulk discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had currencyless payments with all the advanced countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-samtenen" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand - was made.
Since then, direct charter planes with Czech passengers have flown to far-flung sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are to be flown directly from the Czech Republic.
The Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our “post-revolutionary” development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday, including the cost of the resort.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - again a blip threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
So far, there is no agreement on the electoral order to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In June, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post, urging his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two chambers of association, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the general meeting had come to the Volkshaus in the Prague district of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov for nothing, because the negotiation did not lead to any results and it was not only about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
At least partial agreement was reached on this one point, to which was added the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was that representation on a power of attorney basis was not valid.
However, disputes over the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: what should be done in the third round to avoid a patt situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model needs to be found," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three FA<0xC4><0x8C>R vice-presidents, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the largest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly ready to compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, who would find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this, although it is clear that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is that it is elected as much as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical replacement variants are devised, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself in his comments especially against Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football European Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is divisive."
"This is not a thing between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to 'bend' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not ruled out."
"However, I hope that common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - there is no longer much time to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice among others, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the barrier hinspiel.
In the end, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the largest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming General Assembly of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which is to point the Czech sport in the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes into the fight for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, the head of the Pilsen footballers before the extraordinary general meeting, could have identified a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
“If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election.”
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
The main reason for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
“I’ve spoken to some of the eligible people in person.”
“It’s hard to believe that some of them told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“Such views would have liked to change,” he said.
Most of all, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsen district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k that Pelta would hold the position of chairman.
"With his victory, the current state would be preserved and in Czech football it would not be possible at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would get football twice as bad," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone wiretaps to investigate a corruption case, from which Pelta emerged without penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta's victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said <0xC5><0x99>ekl Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who said his earlier statement that he would "sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but looks a bit more relaxed.
However, should Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k win the Thursday election, he could very well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had supported before the general meeting in October, which ended in a fiasco, thinks.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
“He has great abilities.”
“I could think of him as head of the national team, for example.”
“But I don’t think he’s able to lead the association as a manager.”
"I'm not stuck in matters I don't understand," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September caused a stir after he was in charge of replacing Dagmar Damková with Lu<0xC4><0x8F><0xC4><0x9B>k Macela as the head of the referee committee.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k himself claims that he feels up to the role of association chairman.
Based on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also the boss of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league in May with his support.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appellate commissions, which even miscarries in abhorrent situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta chief Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax flows into the sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new president should devote himself to."
“If it comes to gambling taxation, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but they also have to clip and tell clearly where the money is going,” he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also does not consider his connection to the Pilsner club to be a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "super-partisan".
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
“But it doesn’t make much sense in my opinion to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after one and a half years,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would rule out a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he chooses, he would stand up for the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R to get new statutes, which in the future will rule out disputes over the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly be defused if the Czech selection succeeds.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and raising funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
“He feels it’s time for the association to be led by someone,” says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for Sparta and the executive committee for many years.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today’s electoral problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, the June general meeting approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman by September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens’ Union that he used as a means of attracting the delegates.
“If I am to become chairman, I will personally accept that and be willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work out.”
“It’s a principled thing he can’t be without,” Pelta says.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his counterparts.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education and he knows well that his opposing candidate would be his first deputy.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also did not attack for a long time, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes.
"However, his attacks were demeaning and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, too, many now doubt its real character," Pelta addressed to his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he already uttered in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
“I would also endeavor to end all the affairs – from the Cause Bohemians to the aftermath of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Equally after that, I would jump into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," the forty-six-year-old candidate <0xC4><0x8C>TK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the timeless catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If it really is the only issue that is how to choose in the third round, then we will get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially crucial day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will start working hard under him
If former deputy chairman Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly leave many people in the association unhappy.
Rajchl promises that you will start working hard if you choose.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve Bohemian’s case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to youth performance football."
"I don't want to say that I want to do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I am a team player and therefore I would like to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I’ll be distributing hard tasks to keep football moving forward with milestones in every segment.”
“Many would not be delighted because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered no longer running at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
“But I have to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who are not always throwing sticks between my legs and questioning every step I take,” he said, explaining why he hesitated.
“But a lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up, because otherwise others would.”
“That’s trust you can’t lose,” he said.
It is also supposed to motivate him to continue the work he started under Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“In two years, we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw it away.”
"There have been trials that will probably only come to fruition in a few years and I would be reluctant to see someone stop," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - was elected, the situation could return to the times before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in a systematic approach and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
"Behind him are especially people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I can be blamed for some things, but not for being biased.”
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl said.
He also disagrees with the claim that he is only a leader of the Czech Republic.
“Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia.”
"For example, it's time to consider whether you should divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian section, the winners of which then ascended to the first league in each case."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs are playing in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Now that the head of the Pilsen club Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has joined the fight for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull at a single strand.
While he says of Pelta "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football regain confidence", he considers the second rival - Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k - to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staff in the commissions."
He certainly wouldn’t want to turn things in his favor,” Rajchl says of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Climbing pools in Ufo-look, pompous pools in Budapest: those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, their tired legs can rest in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is best.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing in her luggage should not be missing: her swimsuit.
Liing back on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam marble pussies waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it in her notebook - with details worth knowing about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now introduces them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, she doesn’t have much on her hat, says Meder – only in the water is it different.
Annoyingly, only that swimmers have to settle down with blue tiles and chloor stank, while joggers can inhale the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful bird chirping in the park.
“I wondered one day why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Sprung pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have done their best, swimming pools can be a real eye delight: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in bathrooms."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness oasises - but above all makes you want to jump into the blues.
Notable specimens were discovered by pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate water in a quaint karst cave (cave pool in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jázá).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While you can keep an eye on the whole city from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the hustle and bustle on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open to the top, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly of heating oil that one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose mud sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pelvis - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic, has since been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay has been counteracted in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already undergone three phases of construction; you can discover not only Neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of pool stallion Iris Meder - and not only because it originally originated from the Black Forest.
"It's already a great achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets commodity business shine a light
by Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank going to give up its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and therefore the banks are partly responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocates’ campaign is specifically directed against German bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But by now, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business was “worth putting Deutsche Bank’s good reputation at risk”.
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, and the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the bank’s leaders want to say what the consequences are.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann crafts on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "The bet on rising food prices shows particularly dramatically how ruthless banks are harming the general good today."
Ackermann is now a top banking lobbyist in particular.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that use money for food price bets,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board, unlike planned.
With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to shear himself - after all, this would have to do with his successor.
One in two would terminate raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent think it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments that are wagered on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments where money flows into the commodity speculation.
Forty-three percent would warn acquaintances from such a bank, while 49 percent said they were thinking about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and vanished.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold twists and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, are warmed up, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a fitting and famous example for the Brüssler World Exhibition 1958.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria’s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like secondary construction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof after the world exhibition, had been rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century was opened there - the "20s House" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new home.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens its first exhibition - a chance in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, has succeeded the new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art historian with a considerable career, among other things in the youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly enforced the conversion among politicians and protectors of monuments, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and put the use into practice.
In addition to present-day art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “uniquely important place” for him, where he had watched the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost in generosity and ease when it was moved to Vienna and its reuse.
During the current renovation, there were much bigger problems: the building was "an energy spinner", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were replaced, glass-fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel supports have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered moat of light between the house and the street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in old red-brown anti-rust shade.
And the cinema is still exactly as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also appealed to the Heritage Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban accident: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier" is being built, with office and residential buildings.
And another chance may come: the 21er Haus could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss Garden.
Rail plans million-dollar winter crisis package
The railway has devised a crisis plan to prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around 300 million euros are planned.
This is intended to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for the removal of snow on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary switches.
Two months ago, Bahn boss Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays this winter after a top meeting with the government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For example, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more frequently in the workshop, after an ICE in Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar penalty in the US
After the tumult over boss Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay there a million fine.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now also catching up with their past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole host of major banks of misleading cooperative banks into making false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and plummeted the banks.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a German bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank did not acknowledge any fault with the settlement.
The same applies to Citigroup, which has committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the meeting of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in at plundering to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is seeking to compensate for the billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also pre-buttoned other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek redress or punish misdemeanors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of overrating two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals worth around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit from the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand straight for "substantial losses", but without giving an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had dismissed the claims as unsuccessful and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the big American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could be poorly predicted.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s stroke in the financial world.
As a result, the IT rock IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about the commitment.
He praised the management, which had still provided for decent profits even in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time relied on lucrative IT services such as running data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached, for example, a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or machine builders.
Its holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns approximately 80 subsidiaries, as well as shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of earning money has earned him the nickname “Orakel of Omaha.”
After the Buffett investment became known, the IBM stock pre-marketed by one percent.
Big Blue, as IBM is known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to join.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now revived.
The murders of eight Turks and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, a long-dead-believed specter is returning: since the fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology resurrect?" headlined the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with caution: it reminded the victims of racist violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate with a vigil on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish Community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, the coexistence had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media acts like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot refuse to draw this mental connection.
“It’s starting to stink,” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He stresses that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critical are the actions of the police and their later search success discussed in German Internet forums.
Why the German authorities did not think of searching for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Some are at least rhetorically ready to resort to drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be battered here, there is nothing left but self-defense and armament."
“That will be the best self-protection.”
“The goodness of the Enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany,” Selen writes.
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy was clarified by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of self on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was especially criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then counted in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated by the amount of his tax.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts to enlighten and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The scandal bank on Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
This is not what Axel Weber thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take on an almost as spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and dropped friendly remarks about future colleagues.
"UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, however, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s hedge systems and cheated around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered a hit man - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be hard.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed a training period.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the hidden and solid but also exhausted Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a long-time banking professor in Zurich, said: “I have always portrayed UBS as a model of a good bank for my students at the time.”
“From today’s point of view, you ask yourself: How could I be so wrong?”
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was going wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had been rigged with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of a whopping 13 billion francs.
For this, she did find investors, but those, over which some until a short while ago had still had the nose: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so silent that one did not even know his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, still the second-highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the catastrophe ensued: UBS stood before the collapse in the face of its misinvestments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-change bond through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
Only a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty charge.
Thus, the UBS more or less openly acknowledged that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both core business areas: investment banking through misspeculation and asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just when you thought that UBS would get it back, this unfortunate trader story follows: A single trader cheats 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it will become apparent: with risk management in investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago begun to become guardians of the world’s great assets: no too great risks, but security for money – even beyond the Alpine Republic the world might collapse.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The head office of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the well-deserved Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among traditional Swiss shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually displaced - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
The UBS has become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where also the Anglo-Saxons would have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss major bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small seven-million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros were granted by the politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this have happened?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and was growing ever further.
The two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized one.
Suddenly the internationalized investment bankers came in favor of a lot of money, with which they could spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked himself up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," Geiger says.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, perhaps.
Obviously, arrogance came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which Group CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan: Throwing Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That’s where the UBS wanted to go, to the top.
A few steps have already been taken.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she played at the very top.
However, business consultants, who were commissioned, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banker's language "fixed income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also kept risks on its own.
Also, when other banks have long sought the exit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says bank expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS have become a spinning seat and are shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all related business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investing, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to permanently run the business of UBS, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to mid-nineties.
He cut 3,500 jobs.
But that won't suffice.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself now.
So far, he only says publicly that he will first look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe strains U.S. stock market
The impending recession in Europe has taken the courage of U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The throttled industrial production on the continent smothered hopes for a stabilization of the germ debt crisis.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was half-full last week, not half-empty - but now the problems were again pressing in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial assets were on the sales slips.
The Dow Jones index of standard values traded at the close of trading, down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a 1.2% decrease at 5,985.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is adjusting to the end of the upswing.
Companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We are not an island, we are dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to break out of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That’s why it’s too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the heap and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and initially caused it to trade almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America's shares were significantly stronger than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house silvers almost all of its remaining shares in the China Construction Bank and makes $6.6 billion for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution intends to boost above all its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased, thus limiting the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777s on Sunday, putting the order at $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume is even $26 billion.
At the New York Stock Exchange about 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 yielded and 79 remained unchanged.
At the Nasdaq, with sales of 1.38 billion shares, 630 stocks were closed in an upswing, 1913 in a downswing and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like it, others want to get rid of it very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities local complaints about dirt and noise of animals pile up.
So far, a remedy against the “problem birds” is not in sight.
Seed crows can no longer be obtained from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible solutions.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the escape of specially protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the killing with sticks as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the burying, does nothing," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nests spraying away with water or cutting down trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are escaping, large colonies are splitting up and dispersing in other places.”
Burial is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surrounding area, the problem could not be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of burying the animals from sensitive living areas and locking offers to resettle them in other places is conceivable.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens called for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "We can finally endure a pimple in the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, where signs inform about the lives of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion about the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: not only do seed crows use tools to get to a treat, but they even make their own tools as tools.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order for the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larvae.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them wire pieces.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do this right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained unfulfilled.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made it perfect for the fifth straight European Championship participation after the 0-0 away game.
The Czechs reached a 1-0 (0:0) in the play-off-back at away Montenegro, after already the one-off (2:0) had been a clear matter.
There was no further fire for Croatia in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1-1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg-based Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade goalkeeper (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had cut twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa against Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a bespoke start.
Ronaldo threw a free kick from around 30 meters for the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his softshot skills and hit the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg of the English leader Manchester City put a header to the bottom of the latte, the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Thereafter, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice European Champion made everything clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time that the European Champion has competed for the European Championship in 1976.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to survive a second of horror in the initial phase.
Concluder Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the goal of Cech in the 40th minute from the corner of the penalty area.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The gate shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to almost certainly clear his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks would have almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the knockout in the goal.
After the second of the horror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who took the place from the 62nd minute for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championship participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the first leg, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) scored for the guests.
Ireland pushed at the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian rear team prevent the possible lead goal.
In the 32nd minute, it was time.
After an accidental defense of concluding man Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pressed the ball 1-0 over the line.

The number of offices of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP intends to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the businesses of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, are as rare as ever.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
With compassion and generosity, Peter Englund begins his new book "Beauty and Terror: A History of the First World War, Telling in Nineteen Destinies" with a long list of main characters that is dear to your heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You’ll get to know these people very well in Englund’s romance tale, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you’re lost in the fog of war, like Englund’s men and women, and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not misrepresent as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It’s less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather “a book about what it was like,” about “feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods.”
"Beauty and terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers up like the votive candles in a church, some come in, while others extinguish.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" walks with expert view over other places of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsets fly are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," says Englund, "were stirred up with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or gripping, but they are extremely alive in the englunds of the sheer collection of small moments.
Many of them deal with lack and self-help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in haystack fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were soaked with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says about the war: “One feels that despite everything this is what was meant for men rather than to sit in a chair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in his hand, and pretending that such a fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade means civilization and that there is no barbarism behind one’s own.”
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is probably dying and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
“If you walk away from the thought of self-sacrifice, you want to think it’s happening in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as terrible as “a condemned man hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century": "the word of a mass murderer who is convincing and ideologically convincing in a suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is just as much frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade in gonococci pus, because soldiers bought and lubricated themselves on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, making them blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which war “uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually rather falsified as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Im Westen nichts Neues" rather than extensive history books.
Englund’s band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I have ever read of in a non-fiction book.
I'm not giving it here anymore.
But it is as if with his book he had snatched away this page with the main characters in front of our nose and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing operational helmets.
They had decided on the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed, and everyone else initially believed to be taking part in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the house occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathies, could not be repeated anymore.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials have stepped up so-called chaos training — counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” said someone familiar with the commands, which spoke of a declaration as “exercise.”
“The few police officers involved, to my knowledge, didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
“The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department.”
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then left when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including mission commandos from across the city -- hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that over the course of the day many people go in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park,” he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready for departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that swirled from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue windjackets, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the dealings with the officials were very rough.
Mr Browne said television cars in Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
As the police moved westward through the great turmoil of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags with clothes, their city cleaner followed, lifting what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to leave, were dragged outside, and pictures of them appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main nucleus of protesters took up position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were tied together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called in to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, police said.
Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, as he said, “due to improper behaviour and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent officer on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Criminal Officers’ Department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed that from these locations the police were expanding the area around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective shields, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of caretakers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school attendants who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday because the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory because of their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school workers, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid employees in the city and lost their jobs in a chess train on October 7, described the union leader as political revenge for denying the city access to a health fund that the working groups maintained last year.
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that the budget did not specify that school aid workers would be fired.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit in the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the City Department of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the aid workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Justice Department, said the city did not file the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit filed by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the city’s slums to support a lawsuit over unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers as they are chronically underfunded.
It states that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in the 23rd district in Brownsville, Brooklyn have been lost and 46 workers in the 8th and 9th districts in the South Bronx have been fired.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school workers employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “This is not a neighborhood of eligible parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts.”
P.S.: The 36th District’s budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo that authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even though "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred,” the draft lawsuit states.
Mission ended, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations passed a resolution under President John Kerry (Massachusetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties.”
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House argued over the choice of words in a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the role of the U.S. military in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, the bill passed in the Senate, and the chamber agreed to a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a sort of legislative purge -- with a Congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the floor under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell to the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The Committee on International Relations resolution “congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reaffirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board, or will they divide legislators, as the June law did?
The latest version comes in opposition to Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change to the budget or any other area currently to be voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress, covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double – the same law has been presented to both Congress and the Senate – others are only slightly deviating from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients – especially beginners with Republicans who want to polish their CV – the opportunity to boast that they have “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits same-sex marriage is just as a change that prohibits burning flags is a recurring template.
Some lawmakers also want to make it possible to repeal federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As eager as members suggest changes, they are moving as fast as they have been in the past few years.
In the 111st Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments; in the 110th Congress, 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Faceed, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the attack.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at close range during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night singing "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on her own and saying the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared along with Diane Sawyer on the ABC news "20/20", she rang for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that shared her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and traversed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she unexpectedly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her voice on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang – describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special that was recorded shortly before the couple’s new book was published: “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The Special has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the January 8th attack.
In videos Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he read to Giffords an article in a daily newspaper on March 12 about the attack when she interrupted him and for the first time asked about the six people who had been killed during the attack.
Suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a Missouri prison and is forcibly treated while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife’s recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I was hit.”
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you will endure this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, who was watched by, among other things, the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know. I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not. It was compassion.
The grossly contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are crowded with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public increasingly behaves as if the people are suffering in uniform.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops faced in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, there are conversations about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an “angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took up an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he sensed that some of the interrogators were subtly asking whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of military lightness is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are seldom praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely customary in World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could go with her for a drink in her room.
“My alarm bells went on,” Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
“I wish I had listened to my gut feeling.”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind them, pressed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers’ constitutional rights.
In February, filed by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to indict, convict, or appropriately enforce the law.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individual individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture's retribution? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs, so to speak, putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a request to dismiss the lawsuit.
Newsweek’s court records detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be indicted by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 law of the Supreme Court, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active service soldiers.
“The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs’ military service,” the document states.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a woman-hostile atmosphere.
Independently of this, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is filing a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of “personality disorder” that rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service – a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing her of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits claims for people who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were independently presented to Congress by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the suspected military police rape less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole bunch of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut in his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during which she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought the labors would begin, and I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dismissed dishonorably, so she received no support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit Lyman and the other plaintiffs filed is advancing is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he notes, “I think they should move forward.”
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military lags a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there is reform,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed a shooting in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack on his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
“We found it wasn’t hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site’s advertising tool to accurately define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the adds invited users to a survey asking about their educational status, attitude to violence, and assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
“It’s a fairly new research method,” Bartlett says.
Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male, and upset about immigration.
“Those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with that page’s name in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this site that you don’t usually reach with your clipboard on the street.
“If you used to try to interview people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access,” Bartlett says.
“At Facebook, it all goes away – you go straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their total intoxication on Facebook are significantly more likely to have problems with drinking than students who were silent about the topic.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook is also constantly retrieving the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (which primarily used data that only Facebook has access to – masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data trove accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to display its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, anything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There’s no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research needs to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who witnessed two shootings that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway,” he told a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the laws, but I don’t confess my guilt.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he did not have access to the media for four weeks, saying that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he stayed behind the lock and bars.
All participated with the goal that everything would end in a road closure.
“I thought he looked cold and inhuman,” a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and was calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
Some may like that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t do that,” the victim’s relative said.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons From The Interview With Deceased Steve Jobs Showed In A Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently re-discovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was eager to craft diagrams - a man who believed that many CEOs suffer from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great product and a great idea."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer, and he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By this time, it had been more than 10 years since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing at delivery.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly overhauled footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating detailed interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seemingly impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and prompts him to respond more quickly to issues or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview appears somewhat eeriely farsighted when jobs evaluate what other companies do right or wrong in his opinion and represent his own vision for the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumously honoring Jobs' career, but to see Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the leap to grandeur is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he went off and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done.'
Nobody knows why he does what he does, nobody in business really thinks about things.
That's what I've noticed.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Astonished at how costs were recorded – usually starting with “standard costs” based on mere guesswork and then adjusted with “deviation” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the pope was deceived:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and have long distance conversations for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another as they grind through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent stuff around the globe half a dozen times, and when you groaned on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs says.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious prank that Wozniak and he had almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were as good as they could to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love with it.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember sweeping arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are declining:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, okay?”
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are those people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft had been in the 1990s.
You have taken the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about his intricacies.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to the taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to bring those things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn’t been the computer industry, they would have done fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dine With Opponents of Health Laws as Court Takes Case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that will represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to kick-start the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be overturned will presumably be Paul Clement, a former attorney general under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, that challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is heavily involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
Service had included Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events by law and other organizations, with the judge not being a speaker, guest of honor or according to the program not being a guest of such events."
Nonetheless, Scalia and Thomas’ extreme closeness to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alert morale and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morals and the opposition to the Code penalizes the lawsuits of some judges lying, the court abiding by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with floating court proceedings."
Your appearance and your support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do so.
Boeing pulls record $18 trillion order ashore
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft with an option on 20 additional aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order for over 50 of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is a record total of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is Boeing’s client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest order of all time for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin-engine Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, as announced by Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Airshow, an option on the purchase of another 20 aircraft, which raises the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock exchange expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging, as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural hedge,” he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms Boeing’s leadership position in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking the A350’s dominance.
Boeing’s victory in the air show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The rollout was postponed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Apparently Loses Election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race for the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the post of governor in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, who had still led in the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative PAN National Action Party, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the current governor, came in third, a severe defeat for the divided and unfortunate left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates left the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacán may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, “I think this victory makes us look boldly into next year.”
ADB Urges Asia to Help Rescue Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of Asia’s economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic nations must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that are “distress-free” looking at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support for European leadership and European resources by Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.”
“So if China and India can help, then by all means.”
Europe’s monetary union has been in a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe fuels fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia by the IMF would be channeled, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) – would provide greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
"We are facing great challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help wealthy Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said it would be very politically difficult to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India, of whom more than 800 million are living for $2 or less a day.
"Sometimes they'll find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on vacation on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public servants in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” across Asia.
The ADB’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011 now threatens “the risk of downgrade” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves for a downtrend and a significant capital emigration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed up Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war theaters in Afghanistan and civilian ties.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress fails to finalize spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts as well as a stoppage of numerous new projects.
“Such a high cut, carried out in such an ill-considered manner, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfeasible — you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building — and seriously harm other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily separate from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain limiting probability in order to reach the target.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
The cuts were ultimately going to hit the fighting troops,” Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorism fight are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
“Personnel settings have been cut, which would lead to delays in settings and hiring oversight that support the war.”
Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and legal and political support would be disrupted.
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be pushed on us.”
“Confiscation is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly spoken out about the possible cuts, though he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the head of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a grim picture of what might lie ahead – a military with shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,” Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to accommodate potential adversaries.”
“It really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions “create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious limitations on our global deployability and responsiveness, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step in armament so that potential dangers from China and other opponents can be banished.
How to unmask a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how troubling and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy dealing with accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both accusing each other of lying.
The Penn State administration is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly disproved by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of breaches in campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term at the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the test responses so that they are doing well even in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, and this for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharades, in which the goal is to call out “have you!”, the unmasking of a deception is a reputable area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been exposed.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stammer, blush and twitch not always.
However, it cannot be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and unmask.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific results of the extensive and ever-growing area of debunking. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to find our way around in our complex world, especially when hiring or interviewing people or negotiations or administration are one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people lie more often than introverted people, that men more often "self-oriented" lies than women, whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are usually lies).
We also know that when a person is exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing that person’s normal behavior.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject.
You should know better when someone usually triples with their foot constantly, so they don’t blame them wrongly if they triple with their foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of decay.
People who are deceiving may starve when they try to remember their story, perhaps pointing their feet towards the door or leaning towards the exit, changing their position in significant ways, or showing a "relaxation after the hiring conversation", this deep, relaxing exhalation, and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often falsely signal that a hiring interview is over, just to look for this relaxation after the hiring interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
As a result, the answer becomes more perceptive than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic tool to unmask lies, but you can learn skills that make unmasking possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone is less likely to become a victim of scammers, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Revised After Endangered by Delayed U.S. Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, annoying trade unions while reassuring environmentalists, companies building the pipeline are trying to re-plan the project so that they can return to normalcy.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Parliament Building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that a decision on a federal permit for the project would be postponed until the new possible course of action that would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, was reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task of the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was to connect Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But lawmakers in Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ impact on the environment has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says that the Ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged with allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a rabbit attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building that made her little daughter so scared that she gave up in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade made 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a nursery nurse, and Genevieve wanted to go on a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk walked with her luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman in anger.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started tipping water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle rushed to the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for comment.
The lawsuit is based on an undetermined damages claim, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he is not charging any fees and plans the family will donate the money it receives to child cancer care.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put in front of a nursery nurse who is carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm.”
Climatic Disturbances Brake the Economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black labor increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and has raised great hopes for economic growth, is in the government. However, as a result of the climatic adversity, growth may not be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the national economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development of 31.16 percent, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, of which 78.03 percent have been completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent have been partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment to rise continuously in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estat<0xC3><0xAD>stica y Geór<0xC3><0xAD>a observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March, 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 18.28% in the first quarter, and from September to September.
Lower liquidity
The economics scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts in funding passed by legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Black-working
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of black work, which according to INEGI includes 60.38 percent of employees in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages in Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexico’s government agency for labour and social welfare).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, which is much less than the national average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to declining economic activity and rising unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Economy (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143,312 dollars in the same period the previous year.
The Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3,000,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy. The National Congress approved an amount of 200,600,000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be found until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé’s incapacity to rule obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (Mexico’s state chamber of manufacturing industry), said that no effort was made in 2011 to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa has been really very poor this year, hard work has to be done to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to do twice as much. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed the country’s economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slow economy that is not sufficiently in motion to produce an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, which is why we will conclude the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining a vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la Rep<0xC3><0xBA>blica Mexicana (Mexican business association) in Sinaloa, said that the state must be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redetermine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will steer the government’s efforts in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in a number of areas. Economic development has advanced, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The public prosecutor of the Republic announced that the small drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession for the trade of marijuana.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military personnel in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez Road in front of Guard No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the punishment is still in the prison.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Habitat, Rescate de Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 programs run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda said.
The head of the municipal authority for social development said that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to for the three programs, exceeding 11 million pesos.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federation and the community have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of the construction can be expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To not be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his reign, which corresponds to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This was already the case during the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not invested to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the State authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance, , was requested to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Almost 12 million have to be contributed, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The transition from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and due to the need to move the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including Supreme Court President Juan Silva Meza, said President Felipe Calderón did not go beyond his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes to allow the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
The draft lawsuit drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the Legislative Decree be declared unconstitutional, since the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) is responsible for the regulations concerning radio and television, which would violate hierarchical principles and laws.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After adopting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government is not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by means of general rules.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the independence of the regulatory body." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, because it governs state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it results in better utilization of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality, and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, is a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, “made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government.”
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation through the government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
“It cannot be concluded that the government’s issuance of the contested legislative decree would make it into the powers of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she said.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still not counted.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballots is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governor’s elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still not counted.
In this regard, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just on 9 November, the Electoral Office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither its political constitution nor its electoral law nor its electoral justice law adapted to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this election round.Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines provided for this, with the argument, nor had objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and judged the State Commissioner’s vote on constitutional reforms to be “invalid and illegal” because he did not have the right to “decide or veto it”.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the votes in part or in full.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partly counted. The results in the minutes do not agree; the minutes on the counting and calculating of votes are not available on record, or it is not in the possession of the Chairman of the Elections Committee, or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully completed ballots can be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one who is in second place that is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the mentioned candidates.
Vote counting may also be carried out in its entirety if, after the completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case electoral packages that have been suspended from partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral records have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés spilled down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the colonel's last will was for his ashes to be scattered across the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others who died in the accident in a Mexican Air Force plane, returned to the capital of Coahuila, where the nearest people to the colonel took part in the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At 12 noon, the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel landed in the mourning hall, which is on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo, which was initiated by his former students from the technical high school and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparations for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he has stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would be dizzy even on a truck, yet he was always striving to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One Last Farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was discharged with all honors under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. Their honor was bestowed on him by the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the sixth military territory, the Mexican Air Force, schoolmaster and pupil of the technological educational institution of Saltillo, where he also studied excellently as a sports student in 1985.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority sat, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the outskirts of the barracks by the funeral company, where his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother and siblings were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a plot of land at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, members of the military introduced eleven people to the media who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by gunfire in different parts of the body and a pardon shot at an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood wide.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
A few feet away was the body of another person wearing a red t-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained locally, the three people must have been murdered in another place because no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions written by one organized gang of criminals to another, in addition several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaria de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defence) introduced 11 people, including a minor who was part of a criminal offense, which was mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, falconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were initially arrested on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured and the arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12 at 6 a.m., soldiers found a car without license plates with two occupants on their guards in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who, upon sight of the military, tried to escape.
They are charged with secret burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which is supposed to offer the new government, which has led to the crisis that led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which is supposed to offer the new government, which has led to the crisis that led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will introduce a cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
“I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by euro politicians in order to regain the damaged confidence in Italy.
The hasty pressure on Monti was further exacerbated by the volatile market situation, which caused Italian government bonds to be charged with 7% interest for 10 years, in line with the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the fullest."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are designed to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting mostly of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also putting pressure on Monti’s failure.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
Tuesday evening, the session will be concluded.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister has led to the cost of Italian government bonds reaching critical limits again.
A bailout of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government would have to wait until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more chances than Ticos
Of the 22 players picked up from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the bucket.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 convoked 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the Friendship Game, which takes place today at 3:05 pm at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team has only defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico players, on the other hand, have few international encounters as part of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (loss 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches reached a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-colored team today and Spain a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the midfielder of Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l González, with 102.
The number Hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos side and close to Michael Umana are left-hander J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five came in over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games are played in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
From the national team came in less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest aren’t even nearing the 20’s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not had their debut yet.
Spain’s historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored nine goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica on its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected to play for more than 20 years, but the band assured them that a dream would come true when they played in Costa Rica.
The bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview last week from Brazil, assured.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7.30 pm with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, the complete copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true for us as well.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica for a holiday once. It is such a beautiful country that we are sure to stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, they experience the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry to have taken so long until we got here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve put on in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and we are passionate about the jungle, for which Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, this is a great area to surf. In this way, about people who love surfing, we learned about it.
With a look at the tour you have offered gigantic shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we also set no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play each time isn’t easy.
If we put two or three songs that we haven’t played for a long time into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that’s why it’s also interesting for the audience.
With this tour, you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years, and that sounds like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We love and love to make music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birth of Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band comes out of a city, but it’s unusual for five or ten groups to come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this up-and-coming Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate that we are happy to be alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and their music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure you’re not touring too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has brought to life, without the need to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the best, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. It will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all don’t feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why? Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit lighthearted, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
The tears came to both of them when I heard Ed playing them. They're very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – for example, when you lose a family member or a friend – it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who served 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori was being examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasticas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer and he has lost 18 kilos of weight, with other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón, which will be the highlight of his full schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the Uruguayan president.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara “is suitable for exchanging information on all policy areas between the two countries,” the South American country’s presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community, which Uruguay rejected and prompted a request to its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, since November, and since January this year, there has been an agreement on exchanging tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)'s "grey list" of countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustache installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser’s clutches, but so far never in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game, which is coming to the stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which you can play three-dimensional without a special glasses.
“Mario is the figure who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses,” Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the head of Nintendo’s press in Spain, said at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "Nintendo's first video game to be developed for this console from the start" because hit articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson stressed that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows a fast, fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "easy" to capture the less skilful users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" about the different levels of the game, which are becoming more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensional.
This trip of Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the character to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks to fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The mustache installer must overcome platforms speckled with danger to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillos delivery to the United States
Guatemalan President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to hold himself accountable in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the process over the US request for extradition of Portillo ends so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, considering that a ruling court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his reign and had granted all extradition requests to which he had been notified.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n, Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, are extradited for murder and serious bodily injury.
The Coloms procedure is an act of government that takes place when all judicial and constitutional proceedings to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: during this quarter century, 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are more than one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people, took stock yesterday.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems that were threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous leaders of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The participation of political representatives from different directions during campaign periods proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and currently left-green city councilor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Savings Bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far “is a good foundation”.
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house where huge parties were held has been cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon without having resisted.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday at noon the building which they had illegally occupied and where they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction took place on the basis of a court order without any police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The housekeepers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them, and they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also carried damage from it.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while these in the discotheque cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of rest, while according to her statement the noise did not originate from the visitors of the disco, but from the housekeepers and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the statements of the angry neighbors in the last weeks became more and more longer.
The manager of the discotheque said the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had demanded last week to immediately clear the building and to deal with the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the housekeepers had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all apartments in recent months.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to intervene against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris neighborhood was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached Montral Street 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people attempting to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban tender for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its defamation of the promotion of Collserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to New York’s Central Park.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
Collserola’s classification as a nature park plays with this idea.
Yellowstone was no longer used as a model for Central Park, but rather for Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's going to set up gates on the ground.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The call for proposals is not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring topic to which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can resort.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast about the "front of the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been held about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not imagine it "as access to a park, but as a boundary of areas in which to act."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty that the design of a public space entails today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is one’s own limitation to what can be built.
“Limiting something always means setting the next step,” i.e. exceeding it.
“You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [in relation to the General Metropolitano Plan] can lead to a real disaster.”
Modol, who keeps closer to the question, simplifies the side of Collserola, which goes in the direction of Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go in the direction of Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "blow on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams launched ("precisely the right thing," he says) "wire architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, as Collserola's global view is lacking in the tendering conditions: "There have been 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the axis Mountain-sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this led him to take part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length in such a way that a smooth transition between the city and green areas is created.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red representative freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial of alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal is released after Casino Red’s deputy pardoned him before the district’s Second Criminal Court, which is prosecuting the mayor of Monterrey’s brother for blackmail.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonas, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the prosecutor opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed at this place 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had dismissed the crimes of bribe and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta Detention Centre for allegedly bribe the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while he only stayed a few hours in the Central Security Centre as death threats were against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October he was notified by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Yánez, a decree of imprisonment, which found that after the almost two months of investigation, there was sufficient evidence to find Jonas guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to open it in return.
On Monday, Casino Red’s representative, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to pass the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio P<0xC3><0xBA>blico assigned to the court, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gómez whether he had remedied the damage and which the owner of the betting house had pardoned, but the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to rule. In the following, no appeals can be filed against the proceedings and no damages are claimed.
After the hearing of the representative of the betting house at about 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the plane crash in which Secretary of State Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, indicate that the helicopter with all its intact structure crashed directly against the ground without the pilot could have initiated an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions had been suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the trunk, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had crashed.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an incline of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they can take several months, maybe even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown from the Estado Mayor Presidential at a speed of travel and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the crash."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, identified six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Sight flight:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, and during the flight to the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some low-hanging clouds erupted.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen a lower area with better views towards the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Impact site:
The impact coordinates and the helicopter's last radar recordings are the same, and there may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter had hit from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter had hit the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the accident site do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
In the field investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is downhill and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a thorough search of an area beyond the locked area at the crash site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had hit the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
The Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research and Biochemistry Unit at Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud P<0xC3><0xBA>blica (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of México) and has continued since October 8 at the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue at the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed at the Morelos sports field (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he said that the aim was to have three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents fill out nutrition-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further stated that on the mentioned Saturdays, the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), monitored their blood pressure and determined blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes related to childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be conducted in response to health care workers’ concern about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys has increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differs from that of other peoples.
He stated that one Mexican was on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information will be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors will explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics, which is to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If we were to pay attention to the signs that come from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that the number of potholes would be significantly affected and assured.
In his lecture "Technical Hitholes", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface and thus avoid the appearance of potholes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes.
The tensile strength of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very viscous and at 50° C. it is almost firm, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly have a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Atop the wear layer," he said, "is laid out a final layer, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it has to produce friction.
The one that receives and distributes the most forces from these road surfaces also requires a suitable thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water, he said, "because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain gets moist, water enters the layer and is difficult to exit again, causing all layers of the road surface to soften and as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a percussion hole is created, he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes, so the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went empty in the awarding of the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to be content to stand on the winning podium, displaying a silver crown and the band that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained that night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department has already joined the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown almost in their hands. Among the proclaimed misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Garla Dom<0xC3><0xAD>nguez Bell Patriro (1949), Isabella Aljuela (1983), Aljuela Aljuela (1983).
The big question that many people ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been chosen as the Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took home the crown of the Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered decisive in the jury’s decision to nominate her as First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question “Which book influenced you the most and why?” asked by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a way of civilizing, ultimately I think the book that most influenced my childhood, ‘The Little Prince’, is a rather deep book.
At the moment I am reading <0x60>Guilt and Atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that <0x60>passions'.
An answer that met with little anti-love, firstly because of the term "civilize" and secondly because it had not specifically explained how each book she named had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogotá indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one, which had all the applause and had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy competition, public vote on the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the queen could not stress on the stage."
And that was noticed in her first performance in the beach swimsuit at the Hilton hotel and in her two lifts at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed safely in both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist with RCN's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition, after all, does not become queen."
In addition, Valle went out of his way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her dermal defects and fibrosis, which were noted in her stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens' coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there was better, "but her problem with fibrosis on the stomach, which for me honestly was hardly noticeable, squeezed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“Operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay for this job.”
Because of this prize, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was rumored that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize to prevent her from enjoying the crown.
Regardless of whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina will start her year of rule from today, not as queen, but as princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the nomination of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens, who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On 4 November, a lophoscopic officer of the Investigative Unit of the Prosecutor’s Office (CTI) in Cali, Cali, came forward as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), “Alfonso Cano” by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, had been on standby service.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was to identify were located.
In 2000 he settled in Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was instructed to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something great awaited him.
Friday night, he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies, and that there was suspicion that one could be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was to take the ten-finger print of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n dactyloscopy in Cali, the tribute given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identification papers or they do not have one.
We'll take their fingerprints and search the database for them.
The researcher told us that in a theft he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had leaned on his hand at exactly this point when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprint removal, but in this case, we were able to take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by bottles of liquor.
At the time of the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer is the murderer, he is still associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object.”
When they appear, a plant cell or ribbon is used to take away.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," the CTI expert said.
He said not everything was as depicted in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, so not all that you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if a comparison is made.
The “Bitters” Challenge the Authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement on Tuesday challenged New York authorities as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared from the square at dawn and attempting to occupy another spot on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators rallied in front of Zuccotti Square, where they sought access with a court order allowing the "outraged" to re-tent at this location, while another part of the movement stuck to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray said that the “outraged” response to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and allowing protesters to tent.
In addition, the Angry Ones occupied a new park located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give accurate figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had arrived at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing, which is scheduled for Tuesday, and during which the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn is to be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them, even giving them to some police officers who guarded the square, resulting in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street, as well as the application of “laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg clarified to the press that due to this court order the reopening of the square for public traffic and protesters had been lifted, pointing out that the city laws did not allow them to re-arrange themselves with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violate the law."
Bloomberg said he had given the order to clear the place because it had “transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people,” because “some businesses had received threats” and residents “feared for their quality of life.”
“The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “disrespecting press freedom.”
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were thinking of organizing “big actions” for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests since Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television will be the Virgin Mary.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the December 1 television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV released today footage of the television show, in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
The scene features Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" as a Jesus Child.
CTV’s Christmas programme relies not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé described Kim Kardashian as a "whore".
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of falls, the gross domestic product data from July to September were used to finally complete this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the year-on-year ratio.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan starting the fiscal year in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual turnaround in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awakened, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by rising spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - moved into one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and gloomy forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that lays like a tombstone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that in September most member states showed clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator, which precedes the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brakes would have been drawn on the greatest economic potentials.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts
Papadimos says austerity measures would be passed, but conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the rising risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widening uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly being substantiated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and not in any way take back his demand for new elections on February 19.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s statement does not eliminate the doubts about his stance: “We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but to nothing else.”
The Conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body that needs to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse a commitment statement on the fulfilment of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the Papandreou referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demand should not be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
Ministry of Economy spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" amounting to 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knot still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofia of Spain recalled that in the last two decades Spain has become the world’s second donor to this means of international cooperation, based on the fact that it is an “instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in people”.
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microloans in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal, the number of people living on incomes of less than a dollar."
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which runs until Thursday, "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" are mainly guaranteed as beneficiaries.
"We have had many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for initiating “two fundamental goals”.
By the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and 10 million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the loan strategy on the ground.
This was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings in Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and "spokeswoman of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “an ethical commandment” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid in times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that microcredit is a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty”, and that governments of industrialized countries should now work “more than ever” according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, micro-loans are one of the "most important forms of development assistance".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, criticized "the success", "marginalized" people, "always standing in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendees in a city that "opens its gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig took place for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, especially in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow too lax.
The Presidency proposal of the European Commission, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, and ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted several minutes, and which was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, was not in doubt on the part of the three finance ministers inclined to Europe.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the proposal, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro”.
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in an amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, which reinforces the European Union's control of the budgetary policies of the countries of the eurozone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "in order to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposal proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble’s godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal that each country should be weighted in the Governing Board of the ECB according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously entail a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The Chancellor, who is concerned with calming the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request devotes a paragraph to the significance of the "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that two centuries ago Leipzig was the center of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in the case of sickness reports?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the sickness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family assistance fund and give a speech on the - since 2007 ever recurring - topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to test the economy in hardship, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sickness reports.
Firstly, with budgetary objectives: the government is aiming to introduce a fourth cut-off day before considering a sickness report for workers in the private sector.
In good German this means that a sick worker would lose the wage of four days without the authorization of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to incite anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And that was accompanied by another rather symbolic measure: to grant the state officials an unpaid leave in case of illness (so far, unlike the three leave in the private sector, there is no leave at all).
While these questions are under discussion, the majority is also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with work absence.
“Controls will be much more important, and moreover, they will be reimbursed if demanded,” Betrand warned of the RTL microphone on Sunday.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness reporting seems a little disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have borne most fruit.
The French are no more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
First, however, let’s look at the country-wide numbers.
According to the state health insurance company CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Healthcare, daily allowances accounted for EUR 11.3 billion in 2008, accounting for 5% of health care expenditure.
This figure fell by 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and by 54% for sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
This is 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, only 14.5 sick days were granted to the French on average.
An average that hides certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day of sickness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of sickness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days; 15% between 15 days and one month; 15% between one and three months; and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be unemployed any more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (because of disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Scams in the case of sickness reports represent a very small proportion of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak measure is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systemic controls on sickness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public College for the Training of Technicians and Engineers) found, under 1.5 million checks, that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports carried out were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled sickness reports lasting more than 45 days, there were less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed a sickness report.
A digit which represents only a weak measure compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needed a new adjustment program to intercept its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced this in front of parliament, adding to the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," he said in his first public address at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone would be "at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country "by the 9%" of the gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new savings measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right wing, had given his approval on Monday to the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but sent ahead that his party would not agree to an additional savings.
“We will not vote in favour of new measures,” he said at a congressional meeting of his party’s New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debts, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policies that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the EU’s economic and monetary commissioner, who had prevented the IMF and EU from releasing the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, had replied to Antonio Samaras that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalized, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, going beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a refusal to die.
Only 9% of Canadians actually engage in talking to their doctor about conditions under which they would like to die and make dispositions for that purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked to various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice takes place, in patients considered capable of making such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
Viewed from across the country, the rate of hospitalized deaths in Quebec is the highest at 86%.
In the delicate issue of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
But now, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization misuses in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide, would be drawn by incompetent or unwilling persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
We note that, according to a 2010 Angus-Reid survey, 85% of Canadians have already responded to euthanasia because they believe it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalized does not convey the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
For those who have already committed a accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or discontinuation of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law should state that the dismissal of the remedies for which a legally valid refusal had been made should not be considered criminal.
The Panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a stoppage of funds at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors were working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, going beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-altering measures already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for them to be considered at least, since they were not used to reduce physical pain as well as euthanasia and relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme", among other things, since it sets no limits on euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 is asking another person to assist him in his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had read through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there are “guidelines and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the reports regarding the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who, however, with Russia's support, is resisting it and is refusing a "complot" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League’s conclusion of Syria, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, taking a stand in favour of a resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the incumbent Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "depose his official power in Syria", in which about forty civilians and members of the government power were already killed.
“If Bashar were interested in his country, he would resign, but beyond that he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life,” the King of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, complained that the Turkish attempts at mediation, which had been directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave," he said, referring to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have taken an ever sharper tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Two more civilians were killed in "shots and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless considered that the country "is heading towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded with emphasis to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
“Syria will not give in,” he added, adding, “the plots forged against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and is calling for the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which is encapsulating itself in its "paranoia".
An extra-planned re-assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis escalation plan decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "incorrect" yesterday to avoid advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be sacrificial
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that “victims” demand to regain credit lost during the last months of Berlusconi’s government.
The former EU commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today’s clash between trade unions and employers.
It was his task to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the sitting Council President.
Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, had, for his part, been eager to wait for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by Mr Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness in the stock and bond markets demanded their time.
"In a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is "certain that the markets will be duly and intelligent".
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The acting prime minister is supposed to establish a staff consisting of predominantly technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive proof of confidence from parliament by Friday.
Since taking office, Mr Monti has committed himself to working as a matter of urgency with the aim of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "it does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy even taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balancing the budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans raised in recent months, has called in particular for new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus, as a country that has no growth, which cannot respect deficit figures.
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as an EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epochal change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" and "another Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy will now have to pay €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-usable explosive capsule, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as other documents issued by this UN agency for the investigation of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of ISIS’s IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had been working at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for more than three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
He is said to have left the center in 1989 or 1991 to start a company in Kiev that manufactures nano-diamonds.
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was involved in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear explosives system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only extremely skilled in this technique, but also, as a member of the IAEA's state informed the Agency that his entire professional career has worked directly on this technology beyond essential to the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes and Crimes Increase by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes, according to FBI statistics released on Monday, have either declined slightly or increased only slightly in the same period.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased by 49% from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, whereas there was a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews and a 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes globally.
The total number of “hate-motivated crimes” has risen to 6,628 cases at a very weak rate, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"Following a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," Human Rights First said. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights law,” said Paul Legendre, an organization official.
“The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police attitudes toward “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” is presented in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and is becoming more and more like Facebook
Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitter" internet users, whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This makes it possible to find out if they allow their messages to be tracked, if they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested with a small percentage of users before its general internet release on Monday in August, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told French news agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, stuffed with something esoteric-looking wording (RT zur referenzierten Wiederholung des Beitrags eines anderen Personen). followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making insiders happy, thus opening up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the general public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and looks too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The ‘activity’ feature will help me track certain elements of my Flux Twitter better,” <0x40>dannykronstrom said.
Austria (disambiguation)
Insertion of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The ruling government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top bonity.
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision from the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% criterion established by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not dropped to AA+ at a stroke from AAA, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian-Democratic foreign minister.
Austria is also taking place a demand from the Brussels summit of eurozone member states on 26 October: the heads of state and government at that time had called for the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government in this regard is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year; by 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement by 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese government would once again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continues to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, we will intervene just as we did the last time," Noda said.
On Tuesday, the yen, in turn, had risen close to the historic levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen for the dollar to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which has been driving a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen steadily, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as a “refuge” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, with the euro slipping below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar traded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency damages the archipelago's exports, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currencies.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region on 11 March," said Noda, who fears that the yen's deterioration could kill the weak boom already in the germ.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - gained traction again for the first time this year thanks to the surge in export growth and the consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen's deterioration does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defuse the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, the institute's deputy governor, however, has informed the BoJ that it has already initiated "appropriate measures", making it clear that no additional currency easing is expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to pay off the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of hedges it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates rise fast, stock exchanges make pullbacks
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, also drifted a little further into negative territory this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to new tensions over the yields of government bonds in the struggling eurozone, global stock markets are continuing to release some of their recent profits.
“Capital investors are nervous and are only too aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from renewed fears by market participants about capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a 0.7% drop.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern over the future of the eurozone is damaging the unit currency, which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European value was worth 1.3570 dolls, so it fell by 0.4%.
According to the stock market brokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had met in Congress on Monday, had approved a request that in particular provides the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italian and Spanish loan interest rates remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds reached 10 years 6.85%, that of Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October were "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the vizier of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting growth in the Eurozone
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4%, driven by household consumption, in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in the figures for the second quarter, down by 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, saw growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should overcome dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subjecting its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just planning to build nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to add another unit to its park by recommissioning the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is oriented towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason for reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a pledge of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us bear in mind that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to phase out nuclear power, a majority of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual 6 billion euros in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is as little as a devil’s work a miracle means of generating electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent controls on existing plants, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the idea of safety.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious crashes.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction and inexcusable human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident just as it did after the two preceding ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft that allows it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them free rein in the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that determines our country’s economic, social and financial situation as well.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies because of a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students by the authorities had shaped the weekly shows, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of May 23) that France "had not needed talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
From the right, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left, by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, France "can not accept all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared from both right and left in 2005.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his program, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities that indicate partnership development allows us to solve our “migration problems”.
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can potentially affect the elections; however, it is costly economically.
As economics experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out to us in a recently published work summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists regarding the positive impact of immigrants’ jobs on economic growth.
Restricting immigration would detract from growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to replace local workers, especially the less skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than the local wage-earners, as they mainly engage in occupations in sectors that are technically unspent at the workplace.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not irritate local wage workers, and more skilled immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would result in a related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas brought by immigrants is conducive to economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, on average in European countries at about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 makes an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the start of his mandate.
However, these teeth, which were intended to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the entire 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the supreme in Greece.
Some had believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy once and for all overcome its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the Little One" that it was a characteristic of the attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become just as well an "instrument of oppression" as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, an economic and social spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True-False-referendum would have had a dual enlightening character in this respect: on the one hand, that of the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer heading in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized according to needs and in the wrong order.
A vacancy for the European sole ruler or a blind-eyed leap into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full right, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time on a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we no longer know where to end the enumeration - because there is only one crisis and this is prevailing in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that bows to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffer from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on an international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
Because it is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and launch a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions on a conditional European level which cannot be taken without total democratic law without certainly leading us to ruin.
After this proposal has been fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is pushing for European economic governance.
Agreed.
But imagining this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisages the citizens - would be another folly and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" Chip Cards Become a Common Good
The world fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is contactless technology, which enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, after having been behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, the consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speeds, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out contactless chip-equipped bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A small percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should see a real upward trend at least next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," said Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
Banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Société Générale also announced yesterday that it was preparing to launch an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments via mobile phone.
Terrorist front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected relations between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect appear to be confirming.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers has now gained “certainty”.
"The way in which the two organizations operate, as well as the relations of the intelligence services, point to a clear cooperation," he said without going into detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has led to an open interface.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by followers of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators say they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the site of the attack.
Axis (terrorist)
The analysis of the conducted telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we have to wait for more clear evidence before we can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
“But it is conceivable.”
“It has been known for years that the sect is getting financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that this is becoming increasingly active,” said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these “support services” have become more and more visible in their course, as have Boko Harem’s speeches and operating modes, which now indicate the use of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has since put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long considered the group as a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention needs to be paid.
Fast success
Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf – which means “Western education is a disgrace” in Hausa – pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impoverished region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict adherence to Sharia, while the activists affiliated to it are engaged in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the Boko Haram activists were particularly active with their increased attacks against the commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, undifferentiated.
The army encircles the city, with 800 dead.
The imprisoned Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect became increasingly radical and left its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing at Abuja police headquarters, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since alarmed all security experts.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé, on the occasion of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned of Boko Harem and was ready to "communicate all indications".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their collaborators have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican focus.
Slogans fall on China, Iran, and Israel’s aid — often not underpinned in any way.
Mitt Romney, the highest-ranking candidate for the “Grand Old Party,” threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of “currency manipulation” – a leading issue in an America that is most irritated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
It was foolish if this was to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost squeezed the air for his emotion-flattering behavior.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran in the event of sanctions failing to stop the nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb.”
In addition, he has promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, for his part, carries a shameful lack of knowledge of the file.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear power" -- and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, on his part, is prepared to take the U.S. army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, which was banned by Obama in 2009, was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Contrary to current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all this won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as the issue of anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive interlocution with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
However, this adversity is not so uncomplicated.
People are more likely to appreciate the positive national security record under Obama that bin Laden has shut down.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to disarming.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to bring his leadership to life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas transmission line, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas to an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with brilliance and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday the inauguration of the new gas transmission line Nord Stream, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve that transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will deliver 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which will allow a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line on the same route is already heard.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of their power: for them it is now becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not afraid to compare the North Stream pipeline with a “new German-Soviet pact” in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive politically.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by advocating this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of defusing European energy, as the project has broken a gap between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have high gas consumption and whose gas reserves are declining.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas transmission line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be evaded.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long queue made of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which is not interrupted over the entire length by anything: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from this, as the Swedes were little prepared to see a Russian state company permanently settle at the level of their coasts.
"In the event of a breakdown, we close the gas outlet in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission line escapes into the air.
This case, however, is considered by the designers to be very unlikely, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas transmission line is ensured by an underwater robot controlled from a marine vessel for external observation purposes, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas transmission line.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformation of the metal upon arrival.
The gas transmission line was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point and 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each at 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group GDF Suez (each at 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas transmission line.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then leased to this company the full capacity of its gas transport, on a twenty-year contract that can be extended.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas that is actually transported is", explained Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs for both pipelines should be €7.4 billion.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are reluctant to recover their expenses, as Gazprom bears the liability risk alone.
The gas pipeline comes to light on a sandy, pine-wooded coastal stretch near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre high valves form the gas outlet gates.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas transmission lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent writing at candlelight.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-shelled sides, as if aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as it is known today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant for the company, is commissioned to launch the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique, called Mole Skin, which designates a cotton paint used, for example, for covering upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in great demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now in charge of the brand at Modo Modo.
The success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with a sales of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centres and is committed to asserting its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and its new writing needs, which persist despite the upsurge in emails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (detour) ", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a leopard pattern cover.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural spirit of time and knew how to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th Week of Work for the Disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice the average: 19% versus 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
“No,” stressed <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the “Week of Work for the Disabled.”
"The progress made in 15 years is considerable."
At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple.”
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared with 38% on the whole.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the attitudes of mind, which, although certain, but still slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entrepreneurs Association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled" that is "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually impaired.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, as set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, which date back to 2008, point to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now at around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof: the number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of workplaces employ disabled workers between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (20:45 o'clock), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far-fetched to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamentful gesture of his attacking player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to look forward," says the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his performance in the club and the national team, "It is a unity that justifies everything."
“I’m in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of seven, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further intensifying the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he conceives.
“We just walked the way.”
"To be able to play against them means great happiness!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "proud" with kindness.
"The Pride of Giving a Galamatch."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France "has again become a team of very high standards", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc did a damn good job,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician very well sees himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... and towards Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're planning something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games," including the match against France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return game against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first round, both teams lacked skill.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there's a match to play, and to deserve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Considering the first game (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was not able to impress on the matter the important stamp that would have taken the pressure away from it.
“That’s a good result, but there’s a certain risk, because we haven’t scored an away goal.”
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to push themselves in front of an audience that may be equally hot on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are completely convinced that we will be able to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championships,” said Carlos Queiroz’s successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk as we have not scored an away goal," Bento said.
“We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese plan to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the outset to "give them no time to think."
A good idea, on the condition that it is put into practice this time.
