The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached about half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, immediately reacted to Monday’s fall when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
Here, too, is expressed the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Falling stocks in Asia
Asian stocks experienced a dramatic decline on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally attenuated some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange’s index throughout its financial day scored nearly four percent, although it later attenuated its losses by reducing the decline by practically 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, with markets in Shanghai closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The planned bailout actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this is influencing the financial market around the world,” said Hong Kong Currency Office Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial system aid plan to which 700 billion dollars (almost about 12 trillion crowns) should be devoted.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody slump and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent, with a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before it was announced, but as soon as it was shown that the assembly’s proposal was not moving forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: U.S. Government May Inject $700 Billion in Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact on broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers caused a gap in talks over the approval of the bailout plan in its form to help the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion.
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and get it voted on.
The financial aid plan will be discussed in the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and Assembly Banking.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could take place in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose support to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a big breakthrough.
We have resolved our dissenting views on how the package of market stabilization measures should be,” Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government’s fund a definitive shape.
It should buy from financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and should also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already at it," Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything they can to get Congress to pass a final deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ business in the Asian financial market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now, there is no certainty about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and not even if they will not stall at the last minute with any problems.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciating the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which consisted of earning financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages, was retained.
“We’ve worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s progress and that he appreciates “both sides’ efforts to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief of negotiators, said lawmakers decided on responsibility for the program’s money to protect taxpayers’ taxes from their losses, a relieving shutdown of the planned finance plan.
The new law must also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a huge leap toward the agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly installment fees of debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, as relevant.
“Most importantly, this week the congressmen will agree on their support and give it their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek said.
Armed Hand Fight: The MP3 Player vs. Mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the manner of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern record player to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crowded on your shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record player.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly taste the twenty crown market helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the battery life
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even what not even most mobile phones.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most elementary functions such as calling, sending messages, it can play music and video, record both, has a better or worse camera and can even get to navigate.
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDAs they will also have in their pocket a small computer.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator can make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile phone, the earlier the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy dragons.
Few mobile phones manage to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly perform better.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of it, they constantly call themselves still, for more safety, a charger for the job - this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have, because even the worst endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced drives can connect the small memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
On players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music via the computer’s USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library based on the name of the performer, title of the album, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment, be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you will only listen to it every day for a while, as in the tram, then you are enough with any mobile that you play.
This is what virtually any mobile phone can do.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and practically all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
Less include the AAC format (format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service alone could be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and most are limited only to the themes of fleeting success of the radios.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile phone.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you will find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobile phones with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
For most of you, it will limit the absence of a classic headphone entry.
The best, even as far as the technical part is concerned, such as phones equipped with a 3.5mm input for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the record players is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic count by downloading data.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g., the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for changing the memory card (M2 type, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If considered among the most discerning music lovers, take advantage of the more specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles of the line walkman have almost identical use as that of a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator capacity (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned more arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna take long to get there.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of roaming rates will probably come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to lament that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák, has already said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant fall in prices to which the classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of trader and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we inform you about the debut of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, they have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators usually profile themselves with low expenses - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, is often countered by the offer of more tight services.
So, for example, Tesco mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a good hit also the bet on a nothing trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically aimed at the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - it's the operator he likes and he can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept as Poland could engage in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Also from the point of view of the offer of services is relatively saturated"
There are no chances in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be any virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about launching Mobilking in other countries in our region,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ková, spokeswoman for financial group Penta, said in a telephone conversation for mobil.cz.
Indirectly he said that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them, we have made progress in the meetings,” said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they flash better times.
It seems that, for unofficial information, the first official operator would have to arrive possibly by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field,” said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesperson for Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional conformity with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
“In the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that it was possible to study in such a short horizon.
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it to be the biggest contribution from a customer’s point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition, which would lead to a drop in prices and thus a drop in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull the same string, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the biggest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> was at the time of the entry of U:fon by T-Mobile.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: “In addition, it was not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened up to a fourth operator.
As far as the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is concerned, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail great requirements for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
So far no agreement has been concluded as the offer from potential interested parties was rather not interesting enough for the classic operators," Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Relations of the UOHS, added to our question.
These statements are not surprising to the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than a consideration, apart from that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators operate normally, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the lower prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market means and the fall in prices are not in the interest of UOHS.
The really dramatic shock in this whole case is in the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard fight for competition.
"The Office in this regard has found no signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, they do not have a corresponding increase in accountability in their actions on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as are telecommunications regulators,” Chalupa added.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of conflict.
Evidently, there is an analysis of relevant markets by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of commercial tendering.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they collide with many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the UOHS washes its hands in all this matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently introduced to expand <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s competition in the field of commercial tenders, which was not implemented, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This must be well known by the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
All is well, when no one looks
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator still works unnoticed, which in the Czech mobile networks already exist a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are usually companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few of these companies get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the carrier, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that business conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If cases such as those cited were discovered, one could speak of infringement in the terms of the contract that could translate into the end of the collaboration with the given company," Martina Kemrová replied to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
In the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they make no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike authentic virtual operators - they in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of the possible problems: "the law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that their phone’s SIM card is not in their name so they cannot dispose of it at all as a normal carrier customer.”
Precisely this is what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> minimally strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator’s entry?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in the prices of services.
At the same time, in practically every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at the moment the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether it was with formal measures or informal pressure, the first virtual operator emerged and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually arrives in these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is likely to start moving again.
If one of the operators allows a virtual mobile operator to enter, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one on male and one on female voice, one with Choir and another instrumental.
The singers are Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem arrangements are Otakar Jeremiá<0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohlávek considers this Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has already said before that it intentionally chose Singing Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both of them and then also with the Choir to fix themselves on the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it was consistent," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home first sounded in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound
The Prague MHD takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, in the history of the Prague Transport Company is written the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at the moment by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the transport company’s infocenters and stations at the Metro stations, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Rozka<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x87>, Kazty<0xC4><0x87>, Letlis Ra<0xC5><0x88>any.
The bonuses can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket stalls at metro stations, where until now they had to queue regularly to get a regular ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is at the disposal of passengers a window with prepared personnel that helps those interested with the purchase on the internet and also with the reloading of the voucher purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard at the vending machines in some metro halls.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a coin-picking machine and travelers will probably have already noticed them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start running tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
The electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, on the bypass trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"On the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help to confirm the validity of the weather and the zone of the bonus," explained the ticket control, Filip Drapal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules of the public transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reading cards mounted at the driver’s locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany him with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than requesting the driver for this information," Drapal said.
Passengers who do not travel on the bypass buses and do not remember when the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
In 1945, the German Sudetenland demanded that Smoke be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were presumably addressed to the President of the United States in 1945.
It is the result of the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that today are stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts," reads.
Since the union of Czechoslovakia with the southeastern Germans presumably implies - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors in the letter ask the American President to assume for today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it will hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all contributes to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of retaliation from the “Czech oppressors.”
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the <0xC5><0xA1>umavos Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on the <0xC5><0xA1>umavas lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists accurately paints the expectations of the Germans of the southeast at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had minimal intuition that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, enrolled in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British arrested him and placed him in the Holstein prisoner camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be good for them,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Decrees of Benes they would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister’s office, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving behavior.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol at the wheel.
And also to remind you that before you get started, you should tie your belts.
It wants to raise awareness especially among young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and lastly also among professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that catch emotions.
And for this we are attested by the "bleeding" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "You don't think" is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a moment of despise can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a red light is passed and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99>án of the Na Homolce hospital.
And that is why an information campaign in the press is necessary and mainly a negative publicity, concrete the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99>án warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of Israel’s provisional government, Ehud Olmert, spoke out on the restitution of virtually all the lands occupied in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday he appeared in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we’re going to keep a little bit of this land, but to the Palestinians we’re going to have to cede a little bit of that because without this there won’t be peace,” he said.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to hand over a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place" that lies inside the ancient city.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Retirement from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with the Hezbollah (Chitee movement), they must detach themselves from the permanent support provoked by the terrorism of Hamas (Chitee movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Post-accident questions: Are stewardesses on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, we are asked whether the hostesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess opposes the road traffic law," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the 22-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly slow down, and at the precise moment the stewardess distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no places to stand, which the company’s director, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, confirmed to Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we reached the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us his position.
The stewardess does not know the law
“There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess – no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined, "he adds, less sharply, the spokesman Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the road traffic department of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking sites.
That's all," he says.
The buses are divided between the urban ones, where there are places to stand and limited maximum speed, intercity ones with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to stand, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s Transport Safety expert, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, sees no major problems with the flight attendant’s movement on the bus.
“During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
Even here there is no assurance that the turbulence will come and that the flight attendant will be hit on the head.”
"However, if the bus suddenly stops evidently that the physical laws are valid.
The same as on an urban bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the carrier's rules of procedure," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the service of hostesses.
It employs two hundred.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that job risky.
“However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would even save expenses,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason Asiana lacks stewardesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We have no hostesses, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident,” he said less than a year ago for T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
A huge tragedy happened
In the accident of the line linking Naples, a young Pilsen stewardess who had worked for the company for two years was killed.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus without using the flashers.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid him, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the flight attendant's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the flight attendant on the bus in which for a year thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working.
"However, they have not reached any concrete conclusions.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the points system, maximum speed on motorways and the use of mobile phones while on the go,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the flight attendants to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers," said spokesman Hanzelka, who concluded that the control of the safety of the buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
The hope of Dusseldorf rests in Frankfurt
In the letter from the board of directors of West LB Bank to its collaborators, there is no shortage of big words.
The merger of the units of the Dusseldorf bank with the DEKA bank can form <0x60>a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
That’s how he gets the text, when a board wants to show the ability to act in tough times.
Because just like before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance, which recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also from Frankfurt, there has been a lot of talk about the union of such a kind between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know by their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, said that he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, as it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen area that the name of the bank DEKA appears, which with its 3,000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the bank DEKA could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba.
This initiative to create a three-party union was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government opposed Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate started the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging DEKA with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of the Helaba, said he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are to pass, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it stood out much better from the financial crisis than did the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own wish.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that it would try to find a complete solution for the whole bank
As you can combine the coexistence between singular parts of the bank with DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena it’s the first time, for Luca it’s the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena attends him as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything looks different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser brand beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the car park next to the Porta Nuova train station, this evening at 23:45 three buses leave, <0x60> towards Munich, the beer party', expected arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag the South Americans are singing, they had already begun to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver pins, owns these buses.
For five years they have been coming to Oktoberfest, considering that this year alone there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day on the meadow, at 22.30 turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to Bavarian purity law, health insurance and German-speaking guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the motorway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are asleep.
All right, so they'll still need the strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration take another break on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 a.m. in the car park next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersivigiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent are opened, that means walking!” cries Marco in the early hours.
"March!" March and occupy the back sites in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the places in front, because we're going to block, and all of you with yellow caps don't sit on the same bench, scattered all over space!"
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he gets out of his place, he will already be busy!”
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
We want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police get help from seven police officers of the Bolzano Autonomous Province, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The preferred tent of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Well, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking arena will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the real estate financer from Munich, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: lending aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as public law banks.
The cause of that is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period of time – which now, because of distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank’s cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity delayed slightly by 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net profits from financial operations fell to zero, imputation revenues for debtors and some securities also from the dissolution of credit business provisions tended to decline by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
It is only thanks to the high and high revenues from the reimbursement of the restructuring expenses of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the organized business for the consortium companies that the negative balance could account for a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculations with industrial loans for real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the bank Aareal.
As much money could not be made from financing state projects, the Defa began to intensively devote itself to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been canceled.
By 2007, they were canceled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity.
Each year Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a loan the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially not fit to function"
Other sources say that thanks to this money refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that you do not have to need the financing in its full volume.
But the opposite cannot be excluded.
There was a voice that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least concerned people either.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While priority debts remain almost unchanged, borrowing rates according to the position in the property registry tend to be clearly downward.
Affected are above all the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can start from repaying pensions in the short term.
Or something is going to happen, which no one risks imagining – the financial crisis is going to get over in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend nights sleepless, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to and use the new-account transportation of losses for upcoming tax payments of change-benefit compensation in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bent?-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop had to show up at Tachibana High School on the first day, the girls started laughing: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells about Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find my way, fortunately I didn’t miss it.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had come to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who speaks with pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in class have whispered, laughed and waved and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "monkey, cute"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at once, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Afterwards in the recess everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a snack box for me - it's something else than boring German bread chunks.
It had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like mass tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in very artistic mode for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a break.
I read about it in my Manga-Comics.
I'm very curious to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
I’ve been reading Mangoes for years now.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a skinny tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still haven’t felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling danger flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can we control whether they, behaving in the same way as we do, feel the same way?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" the contributions of famous scientists have been published for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the chosen answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware doesn’t match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it makes itself dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Naturally I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another peculiarity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with the language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyhow, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it analyzed by our experiences, so your research presents us big problems.
Most of my interventions relate to the content of consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without regard to their contents, and that is what happens during the short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential goes more to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, as is the case with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view, the sensations are very much attached to the part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar in order to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damas, on the other hand, thinks that sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brainstem, so does Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it not probable.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same way?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, because he is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true, the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches, on the other hand, don’t have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here, as long as the same is measured for rats and men.
Since I do not investigate the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence for Ukraine's ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to start and in both countries there is a lot to do."
The schedule for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed,” said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation down to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's indignant counterattack
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about private life – and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He is angry and counterattacked.
The War of the Roses on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-couple: Eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with InStyle magazine Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the marriage failure: “Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful.”
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The motive for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage's failure is told.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of as Meg tells the story of our relationship as many times in another version,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News.
Among other things, it’s very “sadly” that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again “remember publicly the pain and the changes, all of which means a divorce for a child.”
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so he ends up with his statements highlighting: "Be as my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s okay.”
Airline and hotel ticket prices are dropping
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Air tickets and hotel overnight stays were made cheap again – these are the results of a study by the travel and financial services provider of American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the increase in prices in the first quarter found a large change in the second half.
After for many years prices in the hotel market continued to rise, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average to 6.9 per cent.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of American tourists in traveling decreased."
The decline in hotel prices is also much more noticeable in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and set a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed uptrends:
Because of rising kerosene prices Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, airline ticket prices in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but price changes for the Business Class and First Class were small.
In Germany, the change in prices was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the change in prices is on the one hand the increase in the lax economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the airline travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay of Borussia to him still does not go out to make the goal eleventh.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed by making a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could clearly read from his lips.
I just knew I was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whispered at the cockpit entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were again in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist at HSV, enjoying a very high reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
“Today it wasn’t all nice to see,” added Marcell Jansen.
Also Bastian Reinhard had wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg have to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head-on impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty win,” Martin Jol said.
On Monday, the SV Hamburg will be celebrating its 121th birthday.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It anticipates that the partial ratings in the table will correspond more to the speed of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its players forced late as the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team can not shine with their successes.
“We need more feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the Voting Defeat
On Wall Street, fear spreads.
The first news about the failure of the banks’ bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for a day in his history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At 20:30, one of the most important stock market barometers in the world quoted a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the e-stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1548 points.
At this point the biggest loser on the Dow Jones were American Express who lost nearly 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldmann Sachs Bank lost nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a major investor Warren Buffett had been financially involved in the company.
The bailout plan envisages making available resources to buy so-called “rotten” mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid at once, if not step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive share option receipts for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cashier.
Stock prices in Europe and the U.S. continue to fall
The billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate lowers and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state’s projected saving financial market, the US Dow Jones Index continues to fall.
The losses from the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite salvage actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the action of the Munich real estate financier for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
All over the world, the financial markets have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street Day in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear the US government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation bill, the Senate vote may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: At first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei after profit index fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex main index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75.
After the announcement of the capital increase the shares of Arcandor lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the stakes in the company Thoms Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused researchers to be confused: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity may not be so correct.
The spacecraft "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among the researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuvering of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example from the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American spacecraft used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity which describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, now solemnly believes as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained of astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have known about the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly it possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means it does not send out and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, Dark Matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
As confirmed by Italy’s foreign minister, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, abducted tourists in Egypt must be released.
Sudan’s kidnappers had demanded millions of the ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the bailout have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the hijackers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
Apparently European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented on state-run Egyptian television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and are in security, state Egyptian television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and arrested two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded from Germany the ransom in the amount of six million euros; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to stay in detention until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stieffather Abuse 'Leaded to Suicide'
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before carrying out her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Ms. Rande had said about her, who, having been a great surfer and cyclist, now looked "emotionally dead", as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter concluding, "I used to tie her and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a horrifying experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn’t, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended in court.”
“I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother, the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to police.
It is certainly the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be indicted by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work on the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout/saving of the Bradford and Bingley banks.
The Government, in effect, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humbling" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest accruing in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that hold deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... are called upon today to pay the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Construction Companies Trade Association, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Cole added.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest payable, which may be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The inhabitants of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she may be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail on charges of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was prime minister.
This is one of several accusations of corruption in his charge.
Her longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s militarily supported government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given probation to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that he could not obtain bail because he was already on probation abroad,” said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to file an appeal against the Supreme Court order."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after Oct. 17, according to what an Awami League leader said last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the military-backed provisional government took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the Polio Campaign in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have failed to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign because of Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hampered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge to the Competition Commission following the decision forcing the company to reduce its stake in the rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Court of Appeals that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests hamper competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Antimonopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of the stake in ITV raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom, objected to the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New Investigation into the Assumption of U.S. Lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special counsel to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Justice Department inspector general criticized the action by administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Produrator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Attorney Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from office by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it was later learned that the lawyers had not been judged worse than their colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the layoffs would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successor head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the firings, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is highly critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the matter, and underlines how he had a “primary responsibility” for layoffs, which he “relinquished” from his leadership position and was “remarkably non-collaborative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Meat Loaf epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said getting this recognition would be "an honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
A nearly two-minute instrumental section opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and came to number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell stayed about nine years in the rankings and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for her heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serviced.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and longtime local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway with more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
that wants to repaint Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Land Use Community Committee meeting this month, Avalon agency representatives outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Community district manager Susan Stetzer said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue owning Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as a coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street arose for the first time during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Committee on Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"It was full of trash, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers writing about the East Village bourgeoising, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare, virtually unchanged piece of the city that should be guarded.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk of the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with week-old newspapers blown along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested you could give it a clean.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English pupils.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overriding the gap in final outcomes.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in the eastern region of Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively rated on the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient that was favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant evaluation of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the head of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to instructing English students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has come from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English pupils?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of his party’s politicians on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and its same constant support for dark bilingual education predicting Mr. Obama’s response.
While immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the models of education that work well, rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before falling once again due to enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The development that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, according to the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, over the frenzied weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout “seem to have failed to revive market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rate and exchange rates are going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
The bank’s analysts have lowered its expectations for next year, as low oil consumption due to the economic growth crisis and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second Quarter Madness: Team Sets Record
After having spent, for the last eight seasons, longer than anyone else in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw things unfold in the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a non-scoring game into a game of disinflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
The second quarter started after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazyly under the gloomy clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were on prey, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to foul by Warner.
In the last turnover, Bowens’ fouls could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets regained the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
These are the biggest points the Jets never made in a quarter.
Team coach Eric Mangini, asking him to describe the madness of this moment, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.
They’ve earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Gebrselassie Rested tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After winning the accommodating flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has smashed his previous record of 2:04:26 for 27 seconds, which was set last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution would exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a sharp 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have turned long distances, the marathon record has been cut by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is evident that the suspension left him cool, not oxidized.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I dyed some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's Afro-Eastern rival - for the style of overly orchestrating his careers, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers declined.
But shortly before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko came as a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best-ever staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made an intelligent calculation race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do head-on and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Ethiopia’s Askale Tafa Magarsa took second place in 2:21.31, while Kenya’s Elena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and proofs of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated in the country and Zora Neale Hurston’s childhood home, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison.”
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Depression Season Federal Writers Project – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what is missing.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
“We are very cautious about the way our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a level of poverty double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes scorned, sometimes praised - that was born from slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the preoccupation with Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten inwards the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then in more private areas.
"Out of the road on the left," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the widow's new husband Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitory rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, “Some people didn’t like that.”
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Ms. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcasticly.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin continues.
But, she adds, swinging in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Ms. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no major public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the ’80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street of the labor community.
Expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to it relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a bunch of white boys were going around the city throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
“They also killed a girl once.
They threw him into a watermelon from the car.”
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the Supreme Court’s forced integration that, in Brown v. Board of Education, “insulted rather than honored my race.”
A Residents today say that the de-segregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville’s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - it was used to hugging the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t embracing your teacher because he was white — there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with buoyant confidence and lines like, “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Mrs. Hurston and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again under the spotlight.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposed road.
“The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a real civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd said it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began appearing in large numbers, and residents began looking back at the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006, on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: Just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a street of the past under a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is necessary to do most interviews, and some things — like the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field — can’t be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of birth pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all problems, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hard-working, silly, and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
In New York City, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t notice being in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the honeycomb offices that lie above their heads, the bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face daily the worst “bad office day” since the fall of 1929.
Guys for home delivery keep resonating their metal tea carts across the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between charged apartment buildings, as do human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging to a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their morning take-away food, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait in line for their bagel to the sellers’ carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five o’clock on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer services bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my "trusted personal banker", and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places where they had switched from, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from the credit unions and savings banks of their hometown whose whites only function within the state of belonging, and which claim to treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a ransom buyer.
Office and store workers standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were transferring their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, 50th and some uniformed janitor of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my grocery shopping.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that “I now have all my savings in money market funds.
Switching is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a Belgian affiliate of the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing the mosques with a red line crossing.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprinkled Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the tombs, but investigators think this may have happened by attempting to conceal the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which reached Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was running out.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that garnered nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and Austria’s Alliance for the Future, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also expressed opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Travel Ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police drafted a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after judges had produced evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates’ Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad as well as to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter's individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of county-registered sex offenders and minimize any risks that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, ages 10 to 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he returned to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source at the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master off-stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no ruffles, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Aside from the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in the intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of some hands, carefree because they are not going to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, increasing every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the taste of the "Sing of the Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1978 a long journey to portray the singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with “Portraits of Veteran Athletes” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love portraying people, meeting them and being able to enter a moment in their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters, who sometimes you don’t know, or who leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas a reality.”
This collection of current flamenco portraits entitled "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Photomata Gallery, located at 20 rue de la Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a recklessness"
It’s set in places he doesn’t yet know and is about unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project he works on, a novel that stars Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his time for the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
“If I were sensible, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the outstanding figures of the third edition of the Word Festival and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him an audience dedicated to him who was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humour, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extroordinary adventure" documentation of the "pleasure to read" and "live more than he lived"; how he writes of the "disciplinated way" of his work and infallary.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa said, who said it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent," so he asked writers "not to abandon themselves to frivolity" and "consumes."
The climatology reduces the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of time
The celebration of rejones that closed the fertilization of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the announced rejoneadors that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, according to Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Inclement weather has begun with this fair, as finally two of its three festivities have not been celebrated.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face an enclosure of Castilblanco
There was only a party on Friday.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same evening Alejandro Talavante left his two brats with greetings and an ear, which granted more than his bull.
Of course, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the coso of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after an effort of relief he won the taunt of a large part of the public.
A control is skipped in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>ón (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, wasn’t like stopping.
The officers pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., the Basque Government’s Department of Interior said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the Traffic Unit of <0xC3><0x81>lava carried out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1>ón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated abruptly and skipped control.
The officers began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later at the arc, at which time its two occupants paused to flee to the race through a forested area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hash bales, so they moved it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, officials verified that the license plate had been “doubled” as it did not coincide with the collection in the van’s documentation, so the arrest has also been charged with a crime of falsification of public document.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., was transferred to police units to carry out the appropriate investigations and will be brought to court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under Medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California road patrol told People magazine.
The witness detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping on the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backward, and as he went backwards he passed several times over his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently initially did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and exit the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “I was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived it found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was discarded from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect in driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making deals in favor of families.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its competences," said Llamazares about the action that the party will have to take with the until now councilor in the Seville consistory.
However, the IU leader defended that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: "IU has always defended that such matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that the formation has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled with this filming "a childhood dream", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garci a "unique opportunity" to ambience with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "a sloppy Spain that was mistaken as a leader to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII ", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding such as Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than double that of Blood of May -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated for almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Restart, has focused on what is his usual way of working, staging with actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and those who do not cast, to look "humbling" and consider that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
A four-time Oscar nominee – one of which won – Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect any awards.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I found it amazing.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested to me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel again in one in his shows, as he did in "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever his student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to perform in my work and I am very honored for it.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante de Miguel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas in all their extent, and that they are always in.
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as all over Europe, since she habitually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she’s one of those women who have a huge influence at a certain time and now nobody knows, let alone values her work,” Bayón says.
The show will start today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón Award" (2006-2008).
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That cup of light International", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different provinces of Andalusia, crosses the York.
In addition, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Likes It Less Without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice," and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all of America, to the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look, it was hard for them to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And it was known that he was very sick.
Still, it was a blow to everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid to make ridicule or exaggerate.
A father of film and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, afraid of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the floor, desperately searching for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you have left, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and a champion of lost and won causes, from the drug foundation created in honor of his firstborn killed by overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
A gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing more or less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“He has left us all on a high leash,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and to have a serious private life and away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is their example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when surely the chances of not being.
“But why am I going to eat hamburgers outside the house, if I have steak inside?” he used to joke himself.
In heaven there is the pride that on earth his daughters agree with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none of them were as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that some Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race they called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst race by far I have ever been in.
A plethora of nonsense that, of course, if you took it into account as an evaluation and I examined it, would be a very clear suspense.
But let’s go in parts and from the beginning.
The unreasonable starts with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go they give everything (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the back (first purpose, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second purpose, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like this are a minutiae compared to the race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we had not yet left the backpack, although once we got it, the pickup was worse.
In addition, the rain softened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was coupled with conatos of popular rebellion and assault on the barracks.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, won’t even show up with the right time in qualifying, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn’t mark me the start right.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown an advancement of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as asking for a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company's campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system for recognizing shapes and faces, this “receptionist” can know how many people are in the room, who they are – even remember what they wear – and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells them that he will be attending to him shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial junk, they would go five times faster – man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true. It's true.
It will never disappear but we must think of the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but a relative one.
What Ballmer has said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer boots only to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo in this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee rest rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soda machine a sign asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather shooting to 2010.
Microsoft will be looking for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is becoming more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass the bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we begin to enumerate stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that strong pointed mustache who lifted weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it’s nothing more than the typical men’s cotton T-shirt, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the Anglo-Speakers call, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, because of her name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it is named, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm is not only focused on their tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for comfort underwear.
Although it is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t worry me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not stopped him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than some beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, win on short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but at the same time exciting.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch the women as they go dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have many ties in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know that we dancers really like to do our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you get the dressing room is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You didn't turn 30 long ago, did you get into a crisis?
What's the matter?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a little girl and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because the body asks me and, besides, I want to be a young mother; I do not want to lose this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are pending several premieres that you filmed last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it can not be.
I can’t wait for ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’ to be released.
Seeing how they look...
A few days ago you debuted on a runway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I went on a runway to model.
She simply called me Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we exhibited – I pulled out two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know about Naomi's tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I stick with that very good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever asked me to do the pine, then so too.
For benefiting third world women, whatever it takes.
Drivers who have relapsed due to alcoholism will have to install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the drunk vehicle, or if it is not blown.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so he will also receive a course of road re-education.
In addition to the Prosecutor General of Road Safety, the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for the Safety of the Automobile (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving take the car again.
The alcohol lock would prevent this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in breathed air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abtes; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be on account of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure confines itself to administrative penalties for two reasons: addressing such behaviors before they lead to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the reform necessary by the criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
British timely, at 5.40 p.m., the scheduled time in the program, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed at the presidential hangar of the Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but his rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to watch the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver down the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
Many wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 naval soldiers who play the salute.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, mane to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in the DF was threatening storm.
They give a smile and a sneak stop to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel they are staying in, one of the four big ones in the city, awaits them a reporter from Mexican television.
The best-endowed award in fashion
Possibly there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award than Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite and bont live designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, led us to end up with a luxury dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken in grief and making heart of heart, by the recent death of his brother, put on a suit of the House and some dressings of ELAH, which cut his breath, and the arm of his son Luis - a cannon of almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, with the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store in pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner was transformed in a sexy long black dress, was excited when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, clung to one of the bars and made a big fold lover.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the outbuildings of the palace, but before showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another canyon that travels on a motorbike - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself wrapped in the hectic pace that today’s life imposes.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and problems of disconnection from the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Regardless of yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach bookstores with publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, unplug your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I do not mean those who wake up very quietly telling us something that happened the previous day, but children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, you may be scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somnilochies.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in meseS...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, bedwetting or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stressful situations or overexcitement.
It is an under-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
He may speak in a calm tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress disorder).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire some inner calm.
This will help the child have a quieter sleep.
Once the somnylochies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's asleep and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes it would be advisable to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common), do not fall into the temptation of interrogating him in order to extract information from him.
You will get nothing, because when you are asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thinking.
Also you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, so very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even kidding.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goals and was able to make a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who touched the squadron with a throw from a distance, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn’t let the midfielder pass and we just left Riahi in attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two Riahi and Temporale goals for Dannemarie, and immediately after the scorer's opening for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well placed to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the wardrobes a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven illihousiens who backed down a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after a major splash, the ball passed very close to the cross field.
Sarkozy finds the fishermen furious
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a roundabout for Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance on the part of the fishermen who strongly disturbed last Monday the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet there his representatives.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that " he will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to get measures against the increase in diesel prices, which marks a record to reach 1.14 euros per liter.
According to the spokesman of the Elysee David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to be competitive again and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors ".
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, scratching the dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting that will take place the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fishing committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " they do not want to move to Paris " , announced Liliane Cariou, for example, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel priced below 0.30 euro per litre.
The Great Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of "Two Men and a Destiny" has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who has passed away at 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautical company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, said Embraer President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been pulled out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study selling most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its aerial leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times claims.
AIG must quickly liquidize to repay its $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting it with the right proportion among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic slump on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock market of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, the day on which exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have made it possible to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he was calling for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows just how much the market was counting on this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the US central bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further,” warned Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further emphasizing the sense of urgency, “every day the fall of a financial institution is announced” in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged for the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not just a crisis in the U.S. but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3.632 percent, up from 3.827 percent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond fell by 4.161 percent, down from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House happened another to know who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen said McCain's performance, while honorable, was "not quite "brilliant" to allow him to curb his drop in the polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% vs. 44% for McCain), thinks it’s the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who count, Obama came out victorious with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them conceded victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his candidate, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He’s got good instincts,” Bill Clinton warned nonetheless this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, underlining his adversary’s “naivety” on these issues that were at the heart of this first clash.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without being confused, it was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain hasn’t yet understood, while Obama has already understood,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not considering the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a heavy rain.
He did not utter the words “middle class” or “workers.” “Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable character to save the economy that is on the brink of the cliff.
"Next week could be a decisive episode," said influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic nominee, the current financial disaster “is the ultimate eight-year consequence of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nonetheless reduce taxes by 95% on Americans despite the Wall Street upheavals, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving an eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates dodged the issues pertaining to the extremely unpopular $700 billion bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress.
" In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents marched in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday afternoon to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: " the dictator has to resign ".
Some acknowledge that they did not vote: “for what, because they will do what they want with my vote,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that gave foreign observers a good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to bring about democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered fair for observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of the votes," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regroupment of twelve parties.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it’s the executive branch.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
“But their entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the turnout figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favored the manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition to the parliament, those who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, had reason to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public confidence that had been seriously hesitant by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated any more.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made a lot of efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly asserting that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that "confidence is something extremely fragile " .
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusionary measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
This substantially reduces the risk that certain donors will become infected without knowing it and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries," says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," says Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing as the population ages.
As the most aggressive anti-carcinogenic treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which regroups on average only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All persons in good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can nevertheless donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today’s life is very rampant, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating her blood,” Francine Décary says.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing on the bench of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this," since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the USL's first division knockout series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 in short) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals.
Roger Levesque was the only che to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-trip series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-final.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the return game to take him 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semi-finals by 5-4.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev’s victorious goal
The Canadian’s number one trio is ready to kick off the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian to the barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
“I need another game to feel comfortable.”
He tried to play to the maximum in the first half, scored Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation.”
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party is over, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get himself elected during today’s by-election.
Reject the limits of our last great northern frontier": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force staying on the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three immense screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the elections will take place this fall, although he did show that his schedule was very crowded.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister limited himself however to explaining why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France," is our home, is in Quebec.
Not only is it our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood of gold at Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have disagreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, “with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North,” he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec party of Ungava), have already started consultations near thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given ".
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail to underscore the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to party power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central at the Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage who made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa who made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the issue of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows him to do.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The general weekend council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problem being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec called in particular for recognition of the " Quebec specificity " in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a right of veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcomed the broad lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned from applying it.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a spectacle," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper Cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who waged an unceasing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what it says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who cries out with a false justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of execution.
We still don’t realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no morality anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants a minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the embarrassment is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world tried a €6 million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to take a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will muzzle the opposition as well as scare anyone who will dare to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his view of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done for the change of ideas and not for punches.
It was therefore enough for the mining company to open its books, its records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public" debate by scorning its views?
According to the vice president, this word appears to refer only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn’t understand – or what he doesn’t want to understand – Barrick Gold, is that the public holding the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so mostly because it rejects the brutal manner of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes in arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a chase-bite (in pursuing the "public debate ", Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them to no longer use this word).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long managed debates and disagreements and resolved conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It envisages, in particular, a better control by the elect of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to control the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
"We are making great progress towards a deal that will be effective in markets," Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the bottom line: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions over the daily lives of Americans will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would cause a further failure in the mood of investors.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential elections, who have been late in the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, without forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly one that would allow homeowners to retain their domicile and the salary of the leaders of surviving state-owned businesses.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, responded: "I would like to see the details, but I look forward to voting for it."
"The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to overtake.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayer money the dubious debts, risky and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the burst of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a liquidity freeze and a dislocation of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe we have emerged from the impasse since Democrats agreed that certain “toxic” assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In an effort to ease the hardships for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would pretend to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion to which another $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in the event of profits and that he will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures concerning homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and on compensation in cash paid to managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this bill yesterday, both from Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that “with all evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that consists of profiting from taxpayers.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a cheerleader for a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us to tell us: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was resigning to buy its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is among the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, across the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley Bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it was the one who would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity, and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the record of power that true sacred monsters hold.
But what a great runner in the background!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last American cinema icons of the glory years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he closely resembled and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic covenants.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No disproportionate ego, the ultimate mark of quality.
Because it projected an entire country in love with self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frequented the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and soon in cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a modeling couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the entertainment world that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused vertigo to moviegoers this weekend as their big roles interspersed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual moving parade through it.
Many memories come back as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Zinc Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone into film history.
This delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangante in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and avenging pool player in Robert Rossen’s magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character in Martin Scorsese’s The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mostly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Coen Brothers' The Hudsucker Proxy.
With a final role as the Irish Mafia godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who left the career quite soon, Newman stayed much in the world of film, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its boasts and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humour, "as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallant than of marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected the rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides of his not-so-known true buddhist sensibility.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of modesty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: " my life and my country were better because of their existence "
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his career as a legend, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the cans of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it started as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
She left her five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it is a privilege for us to have pursued the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did they produce in the invoice factory Zuschlag & Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, business mode, continuously and in an organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor ' s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfilment of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of private people.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were false.
For this they obtained the talonaries in the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular seals were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
It asked for an invoice for its consumption and these served as a model for preparing the invoices that they submitted, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as in the City Council of the Capital.
These bills were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people do not fit at once in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the big fancy bill manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. because in the bookstore of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and shown the invoices, he already knew they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to the formal problems it was also not agreed that according to the invoice a hundred people were accommodated, since they only have eleven rooms in which not so many people can accommodate.
In addition, meals were also included in the invoice, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers also did not report that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that on the cash invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was exempt from tax.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition to the hotel employees only issued machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition the "shippers" also made other errors, as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also by formal differences - improper format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied issuing these invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was eating there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously Expired Invoices
Another group of manufacturers of fake invoices are those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület economic association behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, because they later canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to include this entity in their documents.
The following group of manufacturers of fake invoices includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of the fictitious Budapest-based Delta Trio SL, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
The company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation these invoices were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under the process of liquidation.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány charging the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies worked effectively because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he profited from these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri commandite society to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF respectively from the contest, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest.
So that this is not discovered, they submitted to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably relate at the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to speak about everything, this has not been done until the present.
The question is: what interest does it have in doing so?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to ease his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlaps: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-premium" mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group even lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than members of the control group and the "winner" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Until now, they explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped to resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at New York University.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around 500 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name for different diseases of the liver caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E via food (e.g. with water or food contagious), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vaginal mood, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, it manifests itself through a poor general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and in the white of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, urine dark and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Every year, one million people die worldwide from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can lead to liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most people who are infected do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting your family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
Does it hurt less for those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent research, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they attached a sparkling instrument to the patient’s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Lady of the Arminho of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The researchers were hopeful that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt in “security” as “protected” people, “they were reassured and in their hearts reigned peace.”
When looking at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when looking at Leonardo’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such shocking image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, like for a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases really changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results there is only one question left: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or of another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You're what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find it both in people’s pockets, as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which doctors they visit and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who draw a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary to be able to fulfill the original goals of the founders of Google: “Let’s gather all the information in the world in one system!”
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that stirred the world is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to handle all the information.
To the question what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt replied: I wish Google could answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would suit me best?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that while browsing the Internet, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages that they went to at the end of the search are accurately stored.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can revisit what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences previously defined and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, yearning for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that they not only preserve, but in justifiable cases also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most debated example of recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, internet users who care about people’s rights, in May were relieved when the company, along with the EFF, successfully proved in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google, through any of the points of the constitution, cannot be compelled to provide any information requested by the FBI secretly.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get under the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, nearly fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is a rather contradictory view of Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid of providing their personal data because they think it harms their privacy, their private life by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "avant-garde corporation", not their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the world, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborating than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr automatically appear.
We may know numerous cases from which it follows that for example the bride, upon seeing the stream of photographs of the next morning of common friends, learns who spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on the direction of the company: one thing is for sure, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
A person’s “on-line” life is what he shows of himself – this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least seeks to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting with Scroogle, for example, which uses Google’s search system, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who do not want to register on collective pages to prevent them from being able to find them, but you can replace Google's "online" applications, from text-writing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are increasingly rapidly introduced cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft but also to Microsoft.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the top management flatly rejected employee protest after doubling the price of the company’s childcare, considered the unlimited number of employees’ food interests to be too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the Chinese regime violated morale under pressure from the Chinese government and the company and filtered them according to the agreement.
One of the company's internal regulations says that they will not announce any new services in advance, but only when it was ready to work, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to turn the world upside down: while some believe that our own scanning and archiving project of Google's previous books and journals will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, and others fear it.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will be able to provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, novel by popular Cory Doctorow, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man only of the Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the traces of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ozd.
Police questioned two juveniles about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, they suspected, helped clear the crime's tracks, a spokesman for the Borsod province's General Police Police Station said on Tuesday.
The girls acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are now being charged with perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency they are two girls - will be able to defend themselves at liberty.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor to the headquarters of an <0xC3><0x93>zd company, where he killed him and then also killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police examine the weapon with an expert and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which within a few months wants to sell 60 percent of the shares.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer of the Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with an approximately 25 percent stake, followed by Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president - thinks The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hasty-made bill, whose aim is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” of which billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to speak of a “second 9/11.”
According to one part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s view, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then affect the whole world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at wobbly financial institutions, saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, as dominoes, more bank crumble, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone, recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that the concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not so far seriously dealt with the crisis passing like a cuname across the Old Continent.
The “saviors” will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in which cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
Smart car mimics bumblebee flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of type BR23C cars imitating nature, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our security protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of PR and development and research.
Composite eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of composite eyes, engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at a 180-degree angle, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that is immediately transformed into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to dodge obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process must be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotational movement and the acceleration in addition to the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the processing capacity of the data, let alone the storage capacity.
This apparatus in every second should only process a few input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which according to calculations of the Nissan, within ten years will be incorporated into the models manufactured in series.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding existing obstacles in his way.
This dear child already has a name
The written version of the $700 billion bailout package law has been prepared to be applied in several phases to buy bad credit from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to East Coast schedule during new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying the agreement needs only to be formalized in a document.
The commitment to the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and be efficient but more action is needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 p.m., according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the exchanges.
On the bill called the Emergency Law for Economic Stabilization of 2008, the U.S. Congress will vote first on Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy poor-quality credit-fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy bonds of credit, underrated securities and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities of credit fund, in addition to other "poisonous" type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auction or directly - informed competent people of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson said: “The law ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in distress and are waiting for the help of the state will be able to count on the official limitation of their indemnities, which the American slang simply calls parachutes of gold.
Payments will only be limited in certain cases, and the limitations will depend on the form of assistance provided by the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By buying bad credits directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the bosses is not overstated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to stimulate participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that will be in effect a legal limitation on the revenues of CEOs, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional commission responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of the taxpayers, since in the end they can even make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy and with it the bank recovers.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to present to Congress a proposal on how to repay the financial sector’s losses to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures urged the same ones responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial selling prices rose 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and 12.9 percent compared to August 2007's prices - the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose 1.1 percent from July 2008 and decreased 3.9 percent from the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices rose 0.7 percent from the previous month and 3.2 percent from the previous year.
Industrial selling prices rose only to a minimum, at 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the processing industry sectors rose minimally, down 0.1 percent from July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to a 4.6 percent increase in bags and belts per month and a 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a price decrease in the petrochemical sector (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
The prices of papermaking, publishers and printing presses did not change.
In the other sectors of the processing industry, prices increased between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent an important weight within domestic trade, there was an increase of 0.3 percent in August, first of all as a result of the effect of the increase in official prices from the 1st of July.
In a twelve-month comparison – in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors – the biggest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, which was of decisive importance, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).
In the rest of the processing sectors, the pace of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
During the past year in the processing industry globally prices increased by 10.2 percent.
Electricity, gas, heat and water prices surpassed the previous year’s prices by 18.7 percent.
In August, among the different sectors of domestic trade, the largest monthly increase in prices (0.7 percent) was recorded in the sectors of investment goods.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3 percent, with prices in the energy sector and intermediate sectors not changing from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared with the same month of the previous year, the largest price increase occurred in the energy sectors and the intermediary industry (16.8 percent).
In consumer goods-producing industries, there was a decrease of 6.8 percent and in investment goods of 1.4 percent.
Industry export prices calculated in HUF increased by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, and compared to 12 months, there was a 3.9 percent decrease.
The price of our national currency in one month fell by 1.7 percent against the euro and by 7.1 percent against the dollar, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will you no longer need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before Hungarians living there.
“Practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic.”
At the same time he warned that in the new system the entrance premise will disappear, but tourists before leaving the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will interview Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice handing him the Middle Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-like negotiations, on Sunday morning announced that a principled agreement was reached on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to prove that they are better able than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by bringing economic issues to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and disappeared McCain’s advantage that he had gained after the Republicans’ convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president.
At a Detroit campaign rally on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would swiftly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly ... the employment, the savings of you and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are in danger," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that "we'll all swallow this hard ... but doing nothing is simply not a viable path."
The Republican senator said the proposal included the establishment of a control commission to the finance minister and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted daily with the minister.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says Der Spiegel on the weak election result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his supporters are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-headed coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the German left-wing magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours its Parents" he discusses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU achieved 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the aforementioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they made a lot of mistakes. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had its negative consequences on the loyalty of the voters of the CSU.
With modernization, the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the most conscious, most critical and most stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it has been the conventional groups of citizens who have moved farther away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the high school graduates and the graduates.
Support for CSU was thus reduced to less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing situation of internal politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens on the other hand do not yet want to make inquiries about the coalition.
The elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the leaders of the parties barely let see anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left unanswered the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they will choose the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the president of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Member of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Jobs, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
"Most young gypsies have not finished middle school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, there is a need to raise awareness of these issues among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a Gypsy student begins school, the more chances he will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - emphasised L<0xC3><0xAD>via Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the processes of school de-segregation immediately, for which the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights" - demanded Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized annually since last year's Berlin meeting in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be made on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Party president Erwin Huber and provincial prime minister Günther Beckstein remain in their posts, but it is not known until when the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
The members of the much-criticized duo showed: they do not cling to their positions so much.
They sought to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and grassroots organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the scourge against Stoiber, they achieved just 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer, one of Huber’s possible successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors Gabriele Pauli enters the parliament, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition he will also receive an active role Stoiber who until now has been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial head of government and former CSU president called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able together to enhance the CSU that played a pivotal role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the CSU’s losses will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the welfare and stability it guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election result.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, composed of 10 percent and 10 deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution "differed" this time.
Thus the ODSZ abolished the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give an entry permit to the politicians of anti-Kashenko.
It was a sign of deceleration when the OSCE, in evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than mistakes - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the vote count.
All this in the opinion of the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: the political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - has been considering the two regions as independent a month ago.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though “the regime fears allowing even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament.”
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations when it sees the results, but rather tries to convey to voters its message about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before their distribution, but even so I see that it is increasingly those who support the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, referring to the regime of Lukashenko, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, do not consider it adequate even the retirees, who are officially subsidized.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "looks like the silence of cemeteries" - Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, contrary to the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in deeds", so that the lack of opposition is nothing more than a testament to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on more breakfast before starting work"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against whoever signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," said the minister.
“Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the secretary general: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on the part of them".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and melodies.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences for illnesses of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "which wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double in relation to the private sector and well above the rate of inflation".
For now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the Codacons-backed petition.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the least work absenteeism due to illness causes - writes the Consumers Association - the people of the 'vacant workers' are constantly on the rise.
There are millions effectively in Italy the correct and productive employees of the public administration who have joined to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree."
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added due to sickness due to service; the extension of the schedules in which medical check-ups of the sick employee are made, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Neapolitan: "Critical prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people are killed and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association maimed and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and awareness of public opinion".
It has manifested itself, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The many initiatives promoted in the school arena for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work take particular significance.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to slow down the alarm about social severity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive move, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is equally impressive," Anmil Pietro Mercandelli president said.
“We do not want this ‘tendency to decline’ to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is still done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and that the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections are necessary, but also a stronger intervention on the training of the workers, and this from the world of the school".
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as far as communication and awareness of public opinion is concerned.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers with regard to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work" and "the care derivation towards which the system is headed in recent years".
"The objective is to restore to the worker the guarantee of the insurance - it has added - because the fate of who is accidented does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time".
MP3 readers accused of putting hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable musical devices such as MP3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission says, which in a statement released on Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-sounding cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific evidence - the responsibility Ue follows - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is raising consumer awareness and making this information publicly available.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and have the pace with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that it causes.
"Scientists - the executive Ue concludes - confirm that it is of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard limiting the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and the time of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit for maximum noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate on the main points for Rome.
Once the doors closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official cake" of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to emphasize Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can then endorse themselves.
There is no position left over of roles, only the will to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March finished the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary end.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome”.
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, their contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that turn around are manifested.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or stationary, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, of which we have absolute need, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "would not be limited only to the current communal borders but would look beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that interests him to pass as independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he also does today gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a Web site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he won the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
They’re attacks that don’t really say much; they’re attacks that are clearly racial in nature and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And there’s also the polls; they all say Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the cockpit to vote, we will know who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality comes out covered to the last.
“Whatever you say, we’ll think later where to put the cross, whether about Obama or about McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
There are things that have never been said before, which seem almost certain about the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent have replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicking in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Similarly, Iraq for most has been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever assumes the role of George W will have an enormous duty to perform.
It uses, the economic collapse is felt also for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, it is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that “it will do something good” for journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are confident that their journalists share the same values, while locally the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety”.
Executives who plan to lose their job in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and so it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors receive almost always good salaries, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, are "sick" followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the area of the investigation into the counter-pact related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process under his charge, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate company be able to travel the route of the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the camera vote of the representatives against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those in Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Center and South.
The soul, in fact, has become arrogant with the vow of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This just quoted is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not only here.
Whether in the United States as in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual category of state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions – it would finance those who have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
That immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they have not much to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, divides between different interests and different state strategies, does not succeed in deciding any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and especially the granting of funds: from the moment you reach the cut it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market probably and no organization can ever dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute a factor closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the web of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, behold, can certainly be transported from one place of the earth to another but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as sovereign, certainly has many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of unsuitable economic relief species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain unsettling sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in an increasing number.
It seems to advance more and more, in different places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far booming, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the understanding exception of the end, to have made their own time and to be more foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, underground feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, manifesting in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of right-wing collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain with the American (and the rebellion) men.
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what since today is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, grows and potentially stirs in excess.
Faced with all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue for walking on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls like the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come pretty close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a body of 100 kilos glued on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko legs, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more potent than the reptile’s legs and at the same time “easily peels off the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s engineering faculty.
WALKING? - "This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers do, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of micro fibers like hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporaneously with some drugs their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged as fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society currently in progress in Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, canceling the effects of drugs and health effects.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic medicines, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that was derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case of taking a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMEL – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milano: "These discoveries in general are pointed to the various agencies of the international and national drug that eventually provide to change the informative notes of it.
That is why we must always read the leaflets illustrating the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask the doctor or the pharmacist clearly ", stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 bombing, in those days when Enron was bankrupt, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, ending as a consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years came reproach to the economy, but that has now been revealed accurate.
“I’m surprised and a bit upset by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a publicist with a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from the home to the office to the public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by the volunteer developers, of whom their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the less coarse magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version.
Attention also to the multi-operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it electronically, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphical processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene in different users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, over the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for dissemination in homes, it is in business that Open Office tests the suite, tries the big bet, being able to already have several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for the presentation of PowerPoint; Dbase, eat in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work in the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
Target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version is likely to exceed the expected figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the climber’s best shirt.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive racer to the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl’s blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will be angry at the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, winning the shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy, a country of migrant, has only recently become a privileged destination for "hostile" immigrants.
Is this transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support in the North League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI in Congress has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rent market for college students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, the tenant union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain - explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally deformed the market to such an extent that it triggers a process of widespread increase even for the residents".
Apart from the fact that in most cases the rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no-canon limit, sub-linked rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of taxation, prices can be regulated.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lamiate area, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
It is made economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina area, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed they serve 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in the smallest cities prices are lower in absolute ends, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-EUs is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the fee to foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel the historic rooms
The historic cinemas close favoring the Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methions in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono salas in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "is as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place and so much emotion was shared", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury to Cannes, which told the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way to live the lost cinema.
The figures given by the ANEC, the main association of traders, are clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and to pay most are mostly the halls of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are own that have registered the largest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful if new structures were to be built, but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its frequenters are willing to transfer to the methions.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala be in the historical center that in the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged there are mediated tax facilitation in favor of managers and advantages for the public in mobility endpoints: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
"It is an initiative that I like," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meth, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I was already thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politician and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the cosca Piromalli."
The accusations are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the mayor and deputy mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
Also arrested was Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the boss’s namesake, who was already convicted of mafia criminal association and to compensate 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and of common sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been allowed to the mafia family - write the judges - to officially enter the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between organized bad life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean.”
Those arrested this morning are added to those from last July after police had announced the cutting of the head of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, as early as 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor, of the UDC at the time of dissolution, after the bottling in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call into question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the ambient interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of the mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now being discovered by the world's major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil was low, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was set aside, but now that environmental cases and the new rise in oil give the sector a boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the tides and the tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy,” a spokesperson for a company associated with the American oil colossus told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important signal, considering that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are following the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed, indicates an increasing interest.
technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still in the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those Portuguese or the Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas attached to each other.
The force of the waves, which moves the boas up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside the boas.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this type in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, causes the blades of the turbines to rotate, creating a rotating movement that powers the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long roster of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mostly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
