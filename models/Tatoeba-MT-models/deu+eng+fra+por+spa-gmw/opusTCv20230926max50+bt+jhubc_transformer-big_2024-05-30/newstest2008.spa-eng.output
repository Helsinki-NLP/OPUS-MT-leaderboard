European inflation slumped in food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is primarily due to the rapid growth in food prices.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, registering - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, the Luxembourg-based Union Statistics Office announced.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest rate, under the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “we have to negotiate” on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the record of twelve years; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of rampant food and energy prices.
Wheat futures prices increased by 88 percent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose by 52 percent this year, reaching black gold as early as last month at nearly $100 a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will already decline to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain at around 3 percent over the next 3 or 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stalemate, by early December support for the Young Democrats Alliance rose significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup has never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the party’s safe voters – due to the greater firmness of the opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds support (a 71 percent) against a fifth support for the socialists (a 20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary scano: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among safe voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for next year, the majority of the population is experiencing a deteriorating situation and only a tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, more than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government performs rather poorly than well in his duties.
Thirteen percent of respondents trust or strongly trust Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population do not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year 35 percent felt it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believe the only solution is holding new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about turnout responded that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
By way of comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would certainly participate and another 15 percent believe their participation is likely. On the basis of the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of education fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
The Budaörs gold trading triangle hypermarkets maintained the average price level increase of 16 percent, with the difference that VAT has not been raised this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the gold trading triangle of Budaörs the usual Christmas basket of the newspaper Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth far higher than 1,000 HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already “shot” in December of last year, a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point was not experienced.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the nine thousand HUF, today they can not do even for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, nutmeg and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with two-litre redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan with about 18 percent the prices listed in the Napi basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket to that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that during Christmas last year in prices was felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that shattered the trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the merchant misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, it can lose a significant profit on the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two holiday seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of basic consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some basic necessities, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent in the 12-month interval.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product, which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
Based on our experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking by pallets the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, big queues formed in front of the boxes in all three stores because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
This year there have been several thousand infections in hospitals caused in the first place by the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds and the overload of staff do not favor infection control, says the medical-departmental head of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a contagion with MRSA has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred at the same hospital earlier this year.
An injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then has not been able to perform a major surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacterium in his body.
As of December 10, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multi-resistant agents have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance - said Karolina Böröcz, medical-departmental head of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that hospitals have certainly recorded this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents, the rest of the information is not available.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, which is resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once over- or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics transform into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and quickly contagious in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or sepsis, primarily to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened body, to the elderly or to people who are underweight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
“These patients are isolated, nurses take care of them in rubber gloves and masks, and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously screened for MRSA in their body, but infection cannot be prevented in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and contagion with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate those who carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the epidemiological center's departmental physician-chief.
The European Union makes stringent mandates for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for the treatment of infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be performed to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this regard there are considerable shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread through drop transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
What’s more, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are taken, fewer such infections are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so it is fought against in all countries.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative alcohol control of the police commander that caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the XXII district police commander has been made.
It is possible to exclude the possibility of driving drunk or in a stunned state the since resigned commander of the police of the district XXII, who on Tuesday hit and caused the death of a passer-by - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcohol control that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcoholic beverages before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the XXII district police station, on Tuesday with his private vehicle as he turned to Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district, ran over a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(This latter fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
400 million euros more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements worth a total of 400 million euros in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million to finance transport and environmental protection projects in the Hungarian budget, to be realized from the grant of the Cohesion Funds, of which the parties had already signed a credit agreement worth 100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The €150 million credit agreement is also used to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this Hungary objective, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro, they will again deal with the issue of whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without any commission for keeping the loan available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable - the attention of all Europe is directed towards this previously unmentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys from the EU’s even cheaper market, which will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Coast of the Sun", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy properties in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia will be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their lives and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in skiing paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, and the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor is important to them.
The second category is the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group are real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The rise in the price of real estate significantly outpaces the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundreds of Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the meetings at the expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Roadmap on post-emission reduction efforts under the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are now lively discussions on the subject between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on accurate figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, by 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether or not the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological aid to the countries in need.
An agreement was also reached on aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for under the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
The Six by Hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to retain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, from the 1990 level, irrespective of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed, and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the world’s other large developed regions and developing countries are also willing to take on commitments in line with their responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatory to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU Member States pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - says the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed until after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the UN Nobel Prize in Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction, whose need was noted in its most recent international partnership with the IPCC.
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2 ° C of the average temperature of the Earth could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar’s general corps of operations, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the soldiers of the air force that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda practically costs nothing compared to conventional TV spots recruiting - told the BBC defense expert Gordon Mackenzie - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific form they justify the raison d'être of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans are preparing a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the suspiciously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, the officers talk at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, numerous videos from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British military is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with free-to-download shooter video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can stand directly in place of the soldiers.
Salty tombola and cake at the ministries Christmas party
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a toast and a tombola.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is entertained.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts on Orphan Christmas, and the relatives of the soldiers currently on missions abroad will be invited for the Missionaries’ Christmas, and a reception for the press will be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the holiday atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious holiday with respect to the holidays of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the ministry’s 600 workers are expected to attend approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the wallet party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be a raffle draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development from Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit.
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia Day on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the words of greeting from the minister and after dinner there was live danceable music.
Answering the question from [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear costume or evening dress.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400,000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official holiday, but for a working meeting at the end of the year.
There is the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will only drink coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
Minister for Local Governments Gordon Bajnai will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the Ministry’s classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own auditorium with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - of this budget the reception with buffet and a toast will be paid.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, in the Ministry will not be celebrated Christmas.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the one hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas - this is what the corresponding press departments informed [origo].
In the press department of the environment portfolio they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The Forces of the Giant Strike are Gathering
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will set up a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday – the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held – work stoppage will begin.
Certainly this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since the rail transit will be stopped completely and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Unions will inform about the details of their strike on Monday, which they will hold together with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Machinist Union will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while participating unions will strike indefinitely on Monday, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike that began.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strikes.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the National Assembly’s Monday agenda, it is also possible that the public health law may only be voted on in the early evening hours, or perhaps close to midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, significant difficulties in transport will have to face: in the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning may stop part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Volán companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, and their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike indefinitely, others for a defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Railway Workers Union (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will be on strike for four hours, the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical and Thermal Energy Industry, the Trade Unions of the Educators called for a strike of 2 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will strike nationally at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into effect next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, for advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that merit it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was formed in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
The company’s “risk warning” states: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is the fact that “with the escalation of ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy populations of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes can occur”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They said that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsy and hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially in relation to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006, the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state," they add.
They said: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civilian presentation to different political aspirations, based on society’s dissatisfaction with politics and with political parties.
Highlighting the civil and the form of partnership in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of the neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, in many neighboring states, they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way to the Bulgarian National Guard, for example, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass riots of the Roma that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, yet the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also the gypsies of Hungary react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, head of research at Political Capital, when asked by the news agency, said: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and it has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - workdays are reorganized.
Even in the EU or in North America, parties are not united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holiday, state holiday and holidays.
Holidays are fundamentally related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is a holiday - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven festivals written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on October 23, the day to commemorate the revolution of 1956.
On August 20 we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st the feast of work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day festivals the Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when before or after the holiday there is a single working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during the holidays.
This year the work order can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24th practically stops life in the country, since according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in workdays than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in return Friday, May 2 is a holiday.
The other change is related to the October 23 party: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work instead of Friday, October 24th.
On the other hand, the coming year during the end of the year holiday will be able to rest, since from December 24 will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Small Deterrents to Bitter Your Colleagues’ Lives
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: all of them are part of our daily folklore at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
Excuse me, I forgot to let you know that you’ve been searched from the marketing department,” says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best, feel it and try to fix the issue, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that they forgot to give you the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding with shameful explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more irritating than when you want to grab a document, an office tool, or your phone and you can’t find them.
Do you remember that yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry at you for stealing their stuff.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out ahead of time.
Do you gossip about your colleagues’ private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (speculations) you have about the private life of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his innermost secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know things about him.
Are you going on sick leave unjustifiably?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your work, your impossible tasks, your work as a term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, giggles, phone calls
Are you involved in your job, but you get the laughs of your colleagues out of it?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your bullshit, singing, loud conversations (except when you do them over their heads), kicking, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontents out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t mention the chaos that eventually reigns in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that hurts others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and sneakers: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be messed up, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation demands it!
Lose interest if you want to meet audience expectations
The car moves slowly into the usual morning jam.
It sounds a strange beat on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a true gem intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not spoil us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam looks totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are slowly changing the image and although again the garage rock style, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because they cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when asked for soundtracks [b4]cinematographics (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The broader audience knew the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the fifty most important national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendsetter, able to sell itself also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them whether or not they gladly wear this label.
The ensemble reacted the way it should react: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balazs Zságer.
The reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 channel Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi, which recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?)
hvg.hu asked Balazs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: the one you are playing, to what extent is it a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balazs Zságer: The definition of select audience means little to me.
In my opinion there are two types of caste in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can also be composed just for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the West of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Naturally I feel good seeing more and more people attend our concerts.
But we’ve never written music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet audience expectations, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works solo and made his career rather to the West of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, although sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
We rather work as a team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our works with the music of Yonderboi, since many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In mr2's hit list Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love is at the top.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it at the end of the record, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the record and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why precisely to them - what was the main motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of good-voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in the instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought that something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came practically at the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the record it seems like the girls are in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and no stronger than the music, so the music not only accompanies their singing.
They are also on stage in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song is also about it, about forgetting our ego for a while, that whoever came from and where he is going, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate more work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, rather when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then, little by little, everything was put into place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
A disloyal embezzler.
This is what his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banker giant of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
He lost about five billion euros for it.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good skills.
He long ago, unlike all the big Czech banks, intuited the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, shines is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not just in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said.
In the summer, it managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity already saw it coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who had problems with payments in the past and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, his profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I made my first $500 million, I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel confesses, adding that he hasn’t left anything for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that his discovery was not reached.
He even went so far as to deceive the bosses, even as the Eurex Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
The risk turned into profit
Was he afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had made $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to risk himself in that way?
In my position we had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I was never going to win as much as everyone else.
“In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that I was being looked at with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a starter mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew of all this or that they rather suspected it.
“While I was making money, they closed their eyes.”
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all traces.
When she arrived at work on Monday, she was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros to her.
And how did they get to track him down?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of getting 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Out of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be allocated to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Enterprise and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses for obtaining resources in business innovation.
Companies should secure funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that use them the least.
Twenty-year penalty for former Nicaraguan president, court ruled
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday handed down the 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnaldo Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of the embezzlement of 100 billion dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison for house arrest on his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again behind bars.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the prison officers if they let Alemán finish his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved how German was constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that Alemán created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how we approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but most influential view, calmly approved the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Every government begins and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they devote special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as the expenses of the presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit in public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not found in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors, in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from money from the banks’ taxes, fees and credits, often issued, meaninglessly, bonds with which they disproportionately indebted to their town halls.
In recent years, they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we adhere only to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, goes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to indebt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, on the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are least threatened by poverty.
That is why the massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in recent years have been futilely swelled with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the election, if it doesn’t change the retirement age and pension reform soon then it will be the end of really any policy in this country and, whoever rules will be just a bureaucracy.
By exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
That is why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal spending of the leaders’ spending.
The planned deficit of more than $70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not squandered in the last ten years what they could.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Marking will receive more than one hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send forty billion dollars to bid, and then another twenty-four billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and lessen the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for clients.
“This coordinated action by the central banks likely lowered the recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what awaits them still when they decide to take this step,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for loaning money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even as the U.S., Canadian and British central banks cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move made by the central banks contributes to igniting the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. housing market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closing of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“The debates there are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I find only the caricature of my ideas".
Interested parties can now find out about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
In the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that on the warming of the planet there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costlyly unacceptable.
Moreover, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
At the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore they did not manage to change their old driver’s license whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for the change so that officials will have time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without a valid license.
According to traffic, the card has not been changed mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of licenses, the offices of the metropolis are full of applications and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates about 2,000 daily customers.
In the queues is expected half an hour.
Around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued in Prague.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their card and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid card will risk a fine from January.
The offender shall pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police officer can fix the offense with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the fines of 1,000 kroner do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should hand over their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplices detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Prague High Court decided on the definitive expiration of the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime would fall, at first, between 14 and 12 years old.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case but awaits first the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
In other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the district court recognized the involvement in the heist of 19 people and the higher court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ allegations were rejected by the investigation as fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the robberies, and helped members of the criminal group avoid penalties.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, its victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without gun permission.
In the house registry, police found guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser steerer and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some causes have not yet appeared.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing children in the maternity home, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, disagrees in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"Such demand we did not approve, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
“In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescission value.
We remain on the view that it will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>’s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba was used as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist ' s report, only that it was prepared in the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls, according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry, suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stressful situation was better borne by the men, although they fought with recriminations for changing the girls.
Women get worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what happens today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> maternity home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>ermákov<0xC3><0xBD> to P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed out 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation costs for the mistake made in the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily ask the administrator for help.
The court has so far granted them a proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polivka lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit on the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has also Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We’ve been working for about 10 years.
Searching for money and inventing activities,” he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit lies in money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the trademark Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not about orienting him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comic origin came a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his holders discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on stage for her own business benefit.
“It is clear that Bolek Polivka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,” the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among the now decomposed parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From that moment there began to be conflicts between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, elected forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, resulted in the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková, as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which to this day has been rejected by the court.
Something in clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with his princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
From him should come the new king.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are not in a hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can present himself," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I never really liked the Peugeotu 206.
Its driving characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and for me, I only have to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, of the headroom in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer at the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I walk through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the invention of design although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral steering has improved considerably.
What about space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of headroom disappears.
Suitcases to the trunk
But the main thing about this vehicle is its trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear gate) and a well distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot lags behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like that would despise the familiar five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the <0xC5><0xA1>koda at the time that it looked as if the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
In other words, the car costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons in the Fabia and it will reach a pretty similar number.
Now it remains to be decided by which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend and therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between Slovak natives and emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and grudges among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has gone so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist insults.
Police had to act also after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak migrant.
The girls cheered him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave, he made the move to throw us apples and pears, and then he put down his pants and showed us his butt," another unpleasant incident for The Times, the Slovak student's mother, described.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools is starting to be quite tense.
There are 70,000 registered Slovaks in Britain who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come true, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole enclosed with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island does it find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the stronghold of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port for the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, along wide avenues cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century ran.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, the stars of the entertainment world and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abanense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the dear Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, to this day still run in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rusted between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surrounding area as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar mills by narrow tracks in steam or electric machines.
Their garages for dozens of years were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And so, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hacienda de Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not fail to visit it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing on limestone lands.
Mogotes, pylons of limestone and rocks of lofty steep in the falls of the valley, and in their caves are acclimatized fertile lands thanks to which rock formations that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Perhaps someone finds it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was shot there.
Trinidad (disambiguation)
Old Abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so remote that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road to connect it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding area such as Ancón Beach or the Sugar Factory Valley.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already confirmed by the road itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its untouched nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgen de la Charidad del Cobre, the Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, an African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, could all be filled many pages.
However, as they say, it’s better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are what are influencing the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Minister Robert Gates, should devise a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working out as previously thought, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time that conflicts with the Taliban movement are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to step up activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and the distribution of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development on their own,” Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan rebel activity is higher than in the last five years, according to U.S. military data.
The number of violent actions grew from last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
Exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's a little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries that have assisted in recent months, there has been controversy over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Passively he was criticized, for example, Germany.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The sensationalist Sun newspaper this week called the German soldiers vague.
“Afghan rebels discover that Germans play while our boys fight,” Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photo where the British troop played a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government Debt Will Reach One Billion in 2009
For each Czech, the state owes 84,000 kroner.
Total debt in September amounted to 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state's debt in early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
For the whole of last year, the state was indebted to more than 111 million kroner.
“For now it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit we could cross the trillion-crown border until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between $900 billion and a trillion crowns,” David Marek, an economist at Patria Finance, told iHNed.cz.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora, an economist at Next Finance, said: “We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of treasury bonds, government obligations, direct loans or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion z crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt grows but on the other hand it shows that it will be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the state’s debt management and repayment strategy for 2007, it is estimated that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
In early December, the ministry lowered the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest is composed of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion kronor, the reserve of 10 billion kronor for pension payments, 43 billion kronor to finance the obligations of the state and 1.8 billion kronor in payments of the loans of the European investment bank.
He compared Jarthum today in court to having given a name to a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having let pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name Muhammad to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is unlawful.
He was punishable by a lash.
The 54-year-old British school teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with attacking Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code as a result of several complaints by parents of pupils to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7 year old pupils to choose a name for the teddy bear in the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school's principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following caption "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear himself did not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of representing the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m just sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name,” it is according to him only an “innocent mistake”.
An opinion divided by numerous pupils of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her pupils " and " who never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child in a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province during the last session of negotiations in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and final session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time Monday to Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by Dec. 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on Dec. 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in her favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden where these "last chance negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has expressed some of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade particularly said it feared a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
“Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end up as they have started: in the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush breaks off Israeli-Palestinian deal
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputed point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must cease its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides of their obligations with respect to the peace route they agreed in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This denomination covers the three main issues of the Israeli-Palestinian issue: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Upon his return to the rostrum, Olmert pledged to make the forthcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his " two-state vision " of coexisting Palestinians and Israelis.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment in this regard from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because the roots of the conflict and its central aspects are being attacked," Prince Saud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As well as every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17:00 Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but on patrol, and it was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight," explains a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " unapproved, i.e. unauthorized to ride on public roads " (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was " full-fledged " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of surrender the pass to the right," police said.
The control of alcoholemia on the occupants of the vehicle was revealed to be negative.
The state of the car (the defused front, cracked windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " involuntary homicide and denial of assistance " to the IGPN, cocooned with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d ' Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation at this stadium ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the police's version, namely that this minibike arrived relatively quickly to their left ".
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had remained recessed in time for the police car to come to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police had left the site very quickly, thus not providing help to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also avoid " any serious misconduct " on this point.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs further investigation, on which one has to be very cautious," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely overlooks the scene.
"We immediately went down to the hospital with my cousin, who is a nurse, to try to revive them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a cop completely terrified, limping.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young men, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen have been taken by car by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
According to this witness, aid arrived " about twenty minutes after the policemen marched " .
They also practiced cardiac massages, in vain.
" I will not let it be assumed that the police services did not bring assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police cracked down on Monday on the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear-gas grenades used by law enforcement, according to witnesses.
The latter responded with stones, wounding policemen.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement picked up on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped into the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president "exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who ruled against the state of emergency and the waste to which they swore an oath in front of Musharraf."
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf to the presidential elections on October 6, by indirect suffrage.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president "doesn't value any more" after the state of emergency has been instituted, Assistant Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The assistant information minister also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residency by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three (36%) pregnancies is not predicted, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or sterilet still have a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "dominance of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has gone from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
At last, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less a month for one couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair over the space station
It will take more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates on the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated the records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "shocked" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday that astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a thick cylindrical piece tasked with hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon.
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew’s second task was to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power module already present on the ISS in order to put it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the reorganization of the module’s solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And it’s where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, has been damaged in a little over a meter by a cable that was stranded.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to make a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go snail at the end of the 30-meter length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has a highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he cut the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat wrapped with an insulator to prevent electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "shelled" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a noon break before seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for their scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced it will tend to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the A400M engine development, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the mother house of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any further cipher precision.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS’ operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group expected a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday at the polls: the Russians will massively opt for President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message about public channels, already recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing to be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his topic of predilection during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incident,” he said.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziuganov says that there has never been such a dirty election, even in the time of Yeltsin.
After the crackdown on the demonstrations last weekend, the former world champion of check Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the Soviet homo mentality"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in both legislative and presidential elections, outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society in this Christianized country lags behind five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic easing," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had briefly proved themselves after the outbreak of the USSR.
" Why reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new liberties imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are openly accessible.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not until now consultable only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his beneficiaries.
The eleven states in charge of its management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the ratification process of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research “particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these naming documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for a practical purpose: to find the citizens deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers gave their approval to the European Commission last April to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market presence for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants of Baro Manuel change annually to " 47 billion euros of goods " and to " ten billion euros of services ", had declared the New Commission, Minister Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that the bilateral trade in India has not yet reached its potential.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about alleviating the current turnaround of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer to the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an unusually long-term offer.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight by the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks," it said in a statement.
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it appears that the bank England BoE puts liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is “ready to take further steps to keep interbank lending indices” up to date in line with its core index.
The daily interbank index was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, at the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny consideration of PS party propositions on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, amounting to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office including the 50% increase in the bonus for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate per oil products) floating, a check-transportation or rent restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more and no less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival would take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Once known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Republic Festival, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of the production, licensing and organizing of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and were working perseveringly with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
“Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration,” pursues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to argue with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival on an exceptional site that will, lately, take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago's Grant Park, having de-marked itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours is rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression in the European and urban way in the American way.”
Vineland is more or less halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offering is “very big,” like the 80,000-strong Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed at the time of going under press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes into Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the "Governor"?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that will judge the best,” he says.
The race to festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oskars has begun.
Every festival on the West Coast, whether it’s Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on the road to Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to fire the year-end, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, experts are not so clear this year that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based solely on statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainties are lurking in the markets, at least in the short term.
Although they are not in favour of the stock market catching up in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both long and short tranches".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulus from inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture out and say there will be a rally.
“There’s not a lot of joy,” says the expert.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% since its highs on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert underlines that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be ahead of the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to technical levels and therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when it comes to choosing the securities that will be in charge of taking the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year it's up to the big values."
The expert would include the two big banks and some builders in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco says that the rises will come from the banking and industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case of taking place.
“ACS has been regaining positions for several months and we expect other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path,” explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will play a key role in the latter part of the year due to increased sales in the holiday sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bearish month.
The real end-of-year rally was in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
In total 200, located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close a deal with unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of the experience of Popular will be decisive for other entities to sign up or not to this initiative that follows the hours of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with more luminous colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although if a greater recruitment of personnel, since it goes from having about six employees per premises to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a of Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff external to the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've made it.'
With that phrase, Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain that runs doubled the value of its rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: 'it's what hurts me, not because we've grown more but because we've come down less,' he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, ‘we have fallen less’.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts its loss at what we have for the year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave in 1.52% and accumulates a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as publisher) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we monetize it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this announced data becomes real, the television network would register this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while net television revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative development in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009 by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut the expected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered the profit forecast of Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and by 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of Mifid, which entered into force 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the government has submitted to public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of having both come into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Markets Act, entails the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow the provision of financial advisory services to specialized firms as well as to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FSAs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In his passage through the Congressional Economics Committee, several modifications were incorporated, among which he points out that the securitized debts are considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work for a third party, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting customers to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five-tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides a snapshot of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the one employed for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on December 14.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice President and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise in 4.1% of the CPI in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time has predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of the Congress that "even if the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the economy minister acknowledged in relation to the data released today.
Virgin plans to raise €42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time it amassed record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money that the Government offered and that will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get that remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of $30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium’s offer, which includes three other companies, as its favorite to bail it out of bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship to the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretary of the consistory and the head of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then governor of the municipality, and that according to sources of the research consulted by Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal units and the council of Urbanism and no more arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER informed yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore shorthanded, was arrested leaving Morales's home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to head the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside over Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to top the PSOE list for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he has held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of Congress, who on November 15 made public his decision not to stand for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fighting climate change at the university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or screaming" and to "make it look more and more like the citizens".
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and calmly is the Congress, the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good doing" and has not wanted to see himself already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
Since the anti-climate change movement is mercilessly persecuted by both skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in what sectors it has occurred and why your government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires him to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures he will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences will it have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there have not been and will not be such explanations.
It is precisely because it is about self-sacrifice and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Even the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet with nothingness, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a merely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we travel on a bicycle or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, have informed today sources of the investigation.
The mayor was arrested in his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose premises he is currently together with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urban Planning and the municipal management company of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests add to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are imputed in the summary, which is instructed by the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees were brought to court today.
According to the sources, the former governor of Totana and now an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been imputed, as has the current bride of the former governor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, an agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a poultry company well known in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to the real estate development; Conycase, which manages the Vigues car parks in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Advocates, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (in fact at the head of the PISA report on education in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn’s book:
"The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of the subject of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague gives information on the introduction of Internet download offences into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal records worth less than 400 euros from the store, it is simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the one imposed on the discharge (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the unloading (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the author ' s authorization is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone’s hand is going out, a very long hand.

My GP gives me one of his articles on rare research titled, ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less.’
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when both were successful they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one received twice as much, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecution office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, as the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre – in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
Their names are on that list from which the title of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach’s documentary, ‘The Carla List’ (2006, not released in Spain) takes place, which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of an accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
It is for this reason that both people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower accident rate due to their prudence.
In addition, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of having some kind of mishap.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various drawbacks when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the card.
Although the ideal for being well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other, more economical options.
The more cautious drivers can opt for a full-risk franchise, so they get full-risk insurance coverage but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would require the customer to pay a portion of the claim amount.
"The part of the amount of the claim provided by the customer will be pre-set according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, Spain's chief executive of First Europe, an online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on such a base fare.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company’s benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses,” explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, drivers have it easier to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is most advisable to hire a full risk with franchise.
“Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously gained when using an accident, and even when driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the rookie’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable that he negotiate full-risk insurance, as long as his economic situation allows it, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest accident rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (which may be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one extended to third parties from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They conduct a more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford to assume a greater amount of franchise," says Luis Noguera.
For retirees it is advisable to have a full-risk insurance with franchise (this being 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is why it is essential to study adequately the insurance that suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point in Milan that is worth the eighths
Milan and Celtic are measured on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to sentence their classification.
The Italians score ten points and have already certified their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs one to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfica, who has four, does not lead him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on the 13th in the semi-finals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the tie in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in the eighths.
The whole of Gordon Strachan could serve even a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar does not win, but he can not be trusted because to equal of nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to make the night bitter for the Scots, who are confident of putting in eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the first leg.
Waiting for the victory of the rossoneri will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the victory, in case he loses Celtic, both to go into the eighth and to stay in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being the last and without options to remain in the top European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with what UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the group's reunion is "brilliant".
About 20,000 people sold out tickets to witness the concert that included a video that tells the story of the group that made furore in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds at GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
In the run-up to the show, Beckham said the British star "hasn't seen our dressing room at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the quintet to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we all love each other very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies awaited them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears over gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine should pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine pays 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit fees [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom supplements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS 'should test foreign workers'
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees outside Europe, a vigilante said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed to other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the amount of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused in connection with the alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to make sure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although Scotland’s health board uses “Disclosure Scotland” to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor General’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
“While we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff.”
BMA Scotland President Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checkups work in NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport controls, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners at the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “I was very interested in this work in the wake of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups - including foreigners - that they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates in film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division’s late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to star Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress by the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in black and white - featuring the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced at just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony — like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor Award was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently shoots the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named after Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, following a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said militants had planned to smuggle eight shells into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning assassinations of religious leaders and security forces.
The government has warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining Al-Qaeda as militants to fight Allied forces and back the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants – recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government – targeted foreigners’ residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a big effort by the security forces, from five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
Those arrested also include a “media cell” of 16 people in Medina, whose goal was to promote “takfiri thinking” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give an idea of Earth's future
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more Earth-like than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
One kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among candidates.
None of the questions put forward Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s election.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose the YouTube videos to show the candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The issue is one of the most potent topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard ideas they liked: Broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke on extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing the illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
Neither has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least on immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fears of toxic toys from China and other foreign concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became awkward when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all odds, first in the most recent Iowa poll, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is rising in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated remarks from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America's greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Labor
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole to sink into, but it also emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
No influences seem to have been sold, nor are they exorbitant hotel bills in Paris, nor extramarital fingers sucked.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour ruling party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party has not denounced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling for an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence by stating that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative clutter.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it’s the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they are unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new lot takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot make things better, that he has not much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press seeks bad news; and the government gets defensive and does not focus.
On one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that he is new.
Although he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the Commonwealth.
And even if it isn’t directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “partner-effective,” research into funding political parties — voters can assume it is.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable donations, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the job.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is diluted in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter—led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one in six months, and he must also push for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard labor co-operation with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is by acting with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks Cards
Is the Subprime Mortgage Crisis Infecting the U.S. Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal fins swim excitedly around.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the credit card market of the country.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its U.S. consumer financing business, in part due to weak card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delinquency and delinquency are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. Individual Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delinquency) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were getting worse.
The industry also reports solid payout rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25 percent higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge credit cards with debts now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look at liquidity flow more than active securities, so falling prices don’t necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ credit capacity.
They can even work to outperform issuers.
Incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card’s debt rises on the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid asset retaking.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those back fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to get rich at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became a notorious cause in Britain for the extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after the 2001 collapse of Enron.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were of having alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron’s downfall.
The indictment against the bankers — dubbed the “NatWest Three” — alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to devise a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a myriad of frauds at Enron, which helped its spiral of bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interests at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value upwards.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 in interest on the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million were left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses look successful.
The collapse lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were incarcerated last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"It has capacity for up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for company presidents.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract wealthy new Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany coffered yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche at the stand next to his."
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and calderilla compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second-largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was in full swing.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the '70s and the Japanese of the '90s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest consumers and spenders."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank you.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jeweller David Morris.
She attends the show for the first time alongside the brand’s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in evening clothes, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit he wore as a veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feather cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 USD).
“Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelain, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said wealthy Russians with more track record (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade show.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 mattress sets each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton woven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-cuff-shaped car grilles to Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded in Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich-leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who weren’t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with piles of $1 million counterfeit bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire’s Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
Surgery in New Jersey could be the cause of death
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the "Slightly Healthier" restaurant and saw an ambulance climb up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance board," Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, said Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, an assistant to the Newark police department director.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the 212 West Scott Avenue home.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are awaiting the toxicology test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that is grieving the top ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the County Union Attorney’s Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said the house arrived around 3 p.m.
On November 21 they found Mrs. Arroyo on a couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a wilted rose bush is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian barks in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vanillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - stood at the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help to get to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market.
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were heightened by reassuring comments from the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
Stock markets have been loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke’s chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers must be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to continued tensions in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit markets, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October.”
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total labor force, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit tensions in the markets was highlighted after strong demand in a three-month fund auction by the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure by the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the London stock markets strained credit and three-month "Libor" lending rates among British banks, the biggest rise since September, 6.59%, after a steady rise since Nov. 12.
England takes the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara with judgment
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the squad that is on loan—with that particular title at least—is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, England’s director, is beginning to fill in bids to become a national selector, and if not, in one part time.
The one who does not get the sixth bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and the sport too.
It is not easy to throw away what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another respect if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, had been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for "fit and bowls" like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
The Shah or Bopara games at Asgiriya Stadium may only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred double against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of early '88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first class against only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two rounds in May against West Indias in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next game, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some of the elan that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living on swords.
He is caught by nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he tipped his vehicle over at an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked in the distance, to say excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and Fighting Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today from what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that is safe now.”
“They say that Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease temporarily.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in her country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that a U.S. allied force helped drive al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe that had been led from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
“That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops consolidated groups of “concerned citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned because of the denial of visas and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of sectarian death squads.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis, to force them back into Iraq,” the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of the violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will resurface sectarian tensions and start the struggle.
The little Saar, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines for the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sardinians lack only one educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French" - that was the ironic bike about themselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Saarland education system that in a study of the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" ranked fifth.
In this way, higher schools traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, from 15.6 per hundred.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is above average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a bacillariate.
"In the Saarland, the system of vocational education is being exploited," says Axel Plünnecke, the education sector expert at the Institute of German Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people graduate from the Vocational School, so the Saarland is 7 percentage points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Saarland Ministry of Education forced higher schools to make more publicity for specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“Following the first PISA study, we are carrying out some reforms in general education schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for children to start studying the final year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. In the meantime, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether student performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of pupils behind in school development declined from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saarland did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the displeasure of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject at the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez lets change the time in the South American country by delaying the clock for half an hour.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass at least four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States in its day imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with his neighbor Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do it,” says Chavez, who is propelling a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, his power could be greatly expanded in the country.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas on the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said the Uribe decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chavez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes a sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already been downloaded by half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to one forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong conjuncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation’s calculations, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the stimulus of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles told Bild newspaper.
The new burdens of unemployment insurance may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% from one year to the next, is fair and reasonable.
Naturally, the labor office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, in the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it became public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the petroleum derivatives sector reached the highest level in 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that so far had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that rays could exist on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays silence from a height of 54 kilometers of one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to Urey-Miller’s famous life-origin model, lightning caused life on Earth: Storms may have triggered reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the building blocks of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there was life there someday, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus there can be no life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C prevail on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
"Perhaps, Venus is a 'devil' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many papers in Nature, according to the researchers, underscore not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
“This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the south polar region a vortex formed by clouds spinning faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has the mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called the dawn star or evening star orbiting the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble Earth much, scientists assume that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
On the two planets water had agglomerated which on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus dissociated into the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon rocks, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties over the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and that is why he demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Christian Democratic Union Party) in September.
“While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy matters, stresses the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when making a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German finance minister, but also, according to sources in the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be riots like those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be riots as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from taking to the streets.
Barricades were made, vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (Christian Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also look to the fact that our country’s social problems do not take the form of violence.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the "Neue Presse" newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people are involved in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits."
It's still early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
The President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
Care must be taken to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
"Young people should be given the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training faster."
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday about 80 policemen were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the next night in Toulouse.
The riot began in a car accident on Sunday, which killed two young people.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not due to the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The action far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that nothing more is to be expected from her.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the lower house, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
Regarding the reproach that was made to him for having repeatedly devoted himself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house it was very clearly declared to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
There could be no slight interest or feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, <0xC3><0x81>ngela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
Well, he's engaged in expressions to get a boost to people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and worries about low-wage workers?
All he does is talk about this subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong to talk when it comes to the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble “as if it had been in an unknown territory,” when it came to more concrete information.
The attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate of Republican presidential candidates on YouTube and must now fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the very beginning, the tensions between the candidates were evident.
Mitt Romney rebuked his opponent Rudy Giuliani for making New York a “safe haven for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani responded to the former Massachusetts governor by saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers, and that his own home was a "port" for the illegals.
Candidates tend to attack: As the Republican group has so far no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their adversaries.
The short 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were uploaded to YouTube, also have a lot of content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s rebuke to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from Vietnam war veterans, when he refuses to recognize as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate their death.
The public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg, Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are other, not just the war in Iraq or the debates over torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when they praised conservative values and denied the increase in taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I was wrong,” Romney says, apologizing to people and the television audience for being an advocate for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf took an oath for a second five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power with a bloodless military coup, the former general ruled the state for the first time as civilian chief.
With his resignation as Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state attorney general, after the oath Musharraf is going to annul the state of emergency very soon and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists in support of Musharraf. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all remedies before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release a copy of "Live 1974" was made which was written in the best era of the band.
Already at that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle sits 63-year-old Dieter Moebius, dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
Looks like this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia was making music again.
What has to be rebelled here is the following: the precise questions have shown that the name of the band resounded in the minds of people, but it was not something so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always valued more in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry bestowed an Echo music award on members of the Cologne-based band Can 2003 for their life's work, the room could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance at home and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and at that time I did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised much fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Afterwards, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist in the band Neu!
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather an artist’s life full of surprises.
One day, they say, an Ottenstein Harmony singing association banner appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Even though the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother became involved in themes of esotericism and assured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to be thanked Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German contribution in order to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius' work, the band Neu! was rediscovered.
The performance of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, to it belongs the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the drums to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays, electronic music is the way it should be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere one coughs, whispers and at a good time of emphasis sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "68!" is right, too, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
On the stage we reflect very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give away quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moderischer Frieden" are again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But the two of them didn’t have much confidence.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At the beginning there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the handsome man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most important plot to watch perhaps the movie "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and silly today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decay until now retained most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a nutshell: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very fast and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we welcome that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was never really a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another point, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard on two counts), the story about American reporters in the war going to spot a war criminal Serb called “fox,” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a journey in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when we first introduce ourselves to Simon Hunt, who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also foresees a love affair with a Muslim Bosnian woman who they will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" finds itself far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world failed to achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Muslim Bosnians to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It’s so bad that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, so that one comes up with a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is about a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascoes.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
There’s almost always a rule: when a star gets into a crisis region or minefields, then something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arguette, “Across All Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
It takes at least decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the holocaust, taking as an example the film "Schindler's List".
Some films already need more time; classics such as the Vietnam War works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because screenwriters don’t have the slightest hesitation (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime actually was.
Maybe you don't have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
Big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives negative criticism of the Olympics.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday the resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In the last time no other project in the big city fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, you could not keep the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz demanded that the Senate not forget this project, but find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust said Hamburg’s ambitions for the Summer Olympics would not take place until at least 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, it is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation,” von Beust says in WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund’s decision expected in early December on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance at all.”
Still, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too early to let the opportunity be taken away, if at this point the plans are ruined," HSB director Günter Ploß said Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is inconsistent with the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as a "substitution" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Sports Federation of Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate was delaying the development of the small Grasbrook neighborhood, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the building of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow weighing on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four Brilliant-Box "type" on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put in doubt about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968, the Museum Moderna Museet of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén also turned out to be the one hundred "in the Museum Moderna Museet's market, are false, and almost false.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Bright-Boxes" in New York, he painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Bright" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Museet Moderna were exhibited hundreds of Brillo-cardboard boxes. These did not Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Bright" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden a Brilliant wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museet museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Bright-Boxes" of "Stockhol type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him were produced and exposed.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hulten and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of curators at the Museum Moderna Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silvers. It is also not about oil painting, but acrylic painting.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Gloss-Box list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Moderna Museet museum, adding that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibitions.
The Authentication Commission formally announced in July that it accepts these “serious allegations” that soap powder boxes are involved.
But from that moment everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Leader Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for spilling blood.
The soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial on Thursday for attempting a 2003 coup that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Obviously the military policemen who were to watch him had passed into his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blockaded the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to come into our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said the other military troops wanted to follow suit shortly.
Major government critics on Thursday called for a major demonstration against the president.
His government has been criticized for corruption for months.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention because of the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts at coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet said it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday, they made assumptions about entering the business, after Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains equity securities for a third party partner.
United Internet already the day before involved almost 10 per cent of the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital increase measure placed 17.4 million of new shares with a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-products marketing cooperation.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” the United Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies founded a joint company MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, that is, they involve 18.49 per hundreds of Freenet.
That meant both companies retained all the options, especially participation in Freenet.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now, the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
