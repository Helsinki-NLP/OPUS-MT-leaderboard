Members of the Assembly of Wales worried about 'passing as puppets'
Welsh elected officials are dismayed by a proposal to replace their title with the acronym MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal stems from the proposed amendment to the name of the assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be ridiculed.
A Labour official said his group is concerned that the acronym “rimes with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crap.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (puppet) the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the English letter u of the Yorkshire region.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, said that "the final decision on the nomination of the members of the Assembly rests with the latter".
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as a Welsh Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission leans in favour of Welsh Members of Parliament (or WMP); however, a vast majority of Welsh people prefer MWP.
It seems that members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove to be a real headache for Elin Jones, the Speaker of the Assembly, who is expected to submit a bill on the name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name issue in the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: Referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a very long time, Athens has insisted that the name Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly vetoed its neighbour's accession to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the referendum, said he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in trouble, St. Martin's bells silenced
“The elderly people I talked to say that traditionally, there was a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no more today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars have become scarce.
Today, “we don’t date in the same way anymore,” he explains.
“Before, we used to go to the bar as if we were at our neighbor’s house, but that’s not the case anymore.”
As for the churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will run out well before what the officials imagine, and this worries him: "Sooner or later, they will return to the starting box".
He adds that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
“People who buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will precipitate the closure of all churches because they are unlikely to become members of them,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the site in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which was preaching nearby, took possession of the building.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, in which blacks struggled to get employed or get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire ravaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new chime,
Father Johnson’s son and successor to the leadership of St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the “poor people’s bells.”
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
It also mentions that it is the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside Church.
Merriweather says Saint Martin has not replaced him.
In recent months, much has been said about the upheaval of architects and entrepreneurs, provoked by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the latter would impose the costs incurred, even if it did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some parishioners lamented the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old injured by shark during lobster fishing game
According to authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and started paddling up to him to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the young boy was shouting for joy at having a catch, then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
Arriving near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the collarbone.
“I was screaming to get everyone out of the water: There’s a shark!” says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a news conference, Chief Rescuer Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and for security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the UK aesthetics market
Sainsbury's is handmade on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and stocks them with supermarket-like shelves, filled with cosmetic and aesthetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British aesthetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and home sales are declining, larger beauty product shelves will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves conclusive.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space formerly occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its makeup shop line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test dealerships at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second scheduled to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket executives need to dig their heads to attract consumers, who are increasingly tending to shop online and head to local shops for everyday food products.
Mike Coupe, general manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more and more like the supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors to several Habitat stores, since the two chains were purchased two years ago, which the group says has helped drive sales of consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
Previous attempts to restructure the British pharmaceutical and cosmetics chain's shelves had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended a controversy over the distribution of profits from supermarket pharmacies.
Three years ago, after selling its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds was to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-end skincare brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty product shelves has been changed to improve the customer environment.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer informed advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet any need and, thanks to the embellishment of our shelves and the ideal location of our establishments, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now indisputable and changes purchasing habits,” added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones Anger After Holly Willoughby Withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Angered by Dragon's Den star Peter Jones after announcing host Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract for her home decor brand, to devote herself to her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time to take care of the interior decoration and accessories brand Truly.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their fruitful textile and interior design business at the last minute to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the beloved child on TV revealed, at a tense meeting at the headquarters of Dragon's Den's commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contracts no longer allowed him to look after Truly, their interior decoration and accessories brand.
The Truly brand was equated with actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and could have doubled the value of the host's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on his private jet to join one of her second homes outside of Britain.
According to one source, “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
and is about to secure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s headquarters is filled with ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could cause the company to lose millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from cushions or candles, to clothing or household items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
This could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as chairman in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones holds 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was swelling, but we finally loved it.
Trump mocked the media criticizing him for his comment that some consider “unworthy of a president,” and for being so positive toward the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump give up so much?”
He laughed, taking the voice of a TV reporter.
“I gave nothing up at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un was in favour of holding a second meeting after Trump called the first meeting, which took place in Singapore in June, a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on this denuclearization are at an impasse.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s head of diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
He deplored that, on the contrary, the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure exerted.
In his rally speech Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“Everything is fine with North Korea,” he said.
We are close to armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the remains of U.S. military personnel returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this crowded arena, there are barely more than 200 people standing in front of me,” he said, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: An island devastated and hundreds killed in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, aid from foreign NGOs was supposedly not needed.
More than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has been scattered, but no state of national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
“Unfortunately, many times they have made it clear that they do not want international assistance, which complicates things a bit,” said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether field work will be allowed.
A spokesman for the national disaster management agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant tremors, the country is sorely lacking the means to shelter itself from the whims of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no alarm sirens sounded in Palu, which may have contributed to the casualties.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the site of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has placed the reform of dilapidated infrastructure at the centre of his election campaign and has spent considerable sums on rebuilding roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has undermined Joko's government, which is called to stand before voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure due to continued inter-ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been driven out of their homes, amid street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch: Liverpool forward Daniel Sturridge reaches equalization against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a loss to Liverpool in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goals, and his team was led 1-0.
He shot into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot towards the second pole.
The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reached Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended its way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to get in, to get the ball, but players like Shaq are always shooting as far as possible, so I tried to save as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward made a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before rushing into the midfield and sprintering on the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick back and forth on the midfield,
Then he made a beautiful, deep shot that brought Hazard to the surface.
Hazard overtook the defense and finished his run in the second pole net, with a left foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Neapolitans in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia: Death toll from tsunami rises to 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the record of the earthquake and tsunami reported 832 deaths.
Many residents are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that rocked the country on Friday and triggered waves 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesman told a news conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was dotted with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A murder investigation was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., the 44-year-old woman stabbed was found on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police are urging residents of the neighborhood who have seen or heard something to testify.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have captured something on their dashcam, and ask them to provide us with any information critical to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found on a Birkenhead property where she resided.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the scene of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they were informing close relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
Repeat, “It’s too horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon and one outside.
Several officers were guarding the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, as indicated in Register 247 dated September 30.
Parliament: Cromwell statue, last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, in view of the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its puritanical supporters, like fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considered Mr. Crick's proposal "unreasonable" and called it a "revisionist attempt."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the current debate around the removal of statues, it was clear that Oliver Cromwell’s standing outside the Palace of Westminster was not going to be spared.
Cromwell did not ordain or lead iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
It is probable that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
Cromwell’s superb depiction, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, attests to the consideration we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the historiography of a personality that many of us still celebrate.”
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean monarchy of course.
Whether this representation is accurate or not is an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.”
China: a pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, the artery cut and covered with blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pig farm was open.
He claims that there was a huge male pig inside and blood was flowing from his mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutilated the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer’s cousin, said that “his legs were crushed and covered with blood.”
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told Evening News that the animal was locked up to prevent any further incidents and allow police to gather evidence.
Farmer Yuan's family and market leaders are reportedly negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, attacks by pigs on people have already been reported.
In 2016, on a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a wife and her husband, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kilogram pig stuck a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife managed to get him away from it.
In 2012, when an Oregon farmer had just been devoured by his pigs, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that it was not an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
“They are rather playful animals.
Very curious kids... they have no intention of hurting.
It is enough to show them the respect that is due to them,” he assures.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rainfall in the southeastern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northeast coast.
However, Rosa will cause showers in northeastern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and flows eastwards toward the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a storm Monday, Hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the north, in the southwestern United States.
Up to 25 cm of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
At the local level, rainfall reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause sudden dangerous floods, debris flows and potential landslides into the desert.
The rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It is expected to fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in parts of the southwest, including much of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains are likely to cause sudden flooding and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Intense rains could turn the canyons into raging rivers and storms will produce wind gusts and dust swirls in places.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rainfall in a few southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
Rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low debris flows and make the shoe slippery.
This could be the first rainfall in the region’s dry season.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall across the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Significant temperature variations are expected for the month of October across the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropics will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change in time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will suffer considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm beginning of October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeastern regions.
Mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the seasonal average.
Multi-day forecasts indicate that temperatures are expected to be above average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on 6 television channels on Thursday, the gripping hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses her of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
As the political impasse lingers, broadcasters have halted their usual Friday schedule to announce a theatrical coup: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in touching her person and had tried to remove her clothes during an evening between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, said he was also 100% certain that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial likely reached an audience of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels broadcasting the lawsuit, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV in the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts largely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on audition day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC ranked second with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), according to Nielsen.
Interest did not falter once the hearing was over.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was being played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator is taken aback by protesters as he tries to take the elevator to go to the court hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes, while CNN broadcast the sequence of the interpellation live.
“Don’t look anywhere else, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe he is telling the truth?
You hold the power while so many women are destitute.”
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and he would say more at the committee meeting.
All the cable and broadcast networks were covering the session live a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was preparing to vote on the proceeding to advance the Senate-wide appointment of Kavanaugh.
Flake, however, indicated that a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations made against the candidate, which the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was in part impressed by his talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after meeting with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
His choice weighed heavily in the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault allegations.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of making ‘small politics’
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union, of making “small politics” at the expense of Britain’s future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which posted a photo of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, saying the proposal for free trade between Britain and the European Union was "cleanly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, was convicted and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson clash, and police said Sims lost her glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses bore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to police being responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge parish medical examiner's office on Friday released a preliminary report, which determined that the death was caused by an injury from a bullet that passed through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “commitment and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and shocked" after news of Wayde's death.
“We’re afraid of this kind of event all the time,” Wade said.
Mexico: a volcano spews ashes
The ash escaping from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Reduction recommended that Mexicans move away from the volcano, after recording a spike in activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center monitored several roaring and tremors from Popocatepetl.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano 72 km from the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists as the anniversary of the independence vote approaches
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined in protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repressed by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating clouds of dust in the streets, which usually do not fill tourists.
Clashes also erupted later in the day, while police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "neither forgetting nor forgiving" faced unionist supporters shouting "long life to Spain".
14 demonstrators with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the referendum on October 1, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalans in favour of separation, tensions remain sharp in the independence region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with secessionists largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the national police.
It took place nonetheless, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia’s independence.
“We witnessed a great time last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a dead end,” he said.
Despite their capital, albeit thin, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be tried for organizing the referendum and declaring Catalonia’s independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the police support demonstration on his phone, says politicians are responsible for blocking the situation on both sides.
“The tension is only rising,” he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for election to the European Parliament next year.
“This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government,” he added.
Londonderry arrest: men hit house by car

Police Captain Bob Blemmings said the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also shot with arrows.
Livingston wins match 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
Recently climbed to the ranks, the Livingston team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current Ibrox club coach.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to be in 2nd place in the standings, tied for Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are deprived of away wins in the Premiership league this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads by 8 points.
But before, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League this Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she extended her undefeated career in the division by 6 games, and her head coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, can boast of not having lost a single game yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face dull opponents
Holt's team could have gotten ahead well before scoring, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson attempted to pierce but remained stuck in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention from Alan Lithgow, on a head pass from Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers own the ball, knowing that they could get in the way with hard-working tactics.
This is where the decisive goal came in.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to catch Menga, who took a touch and scored a midfield goal.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the game but faced impenetrable defense and goaltender Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half saw the same pace, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped a strike from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to thwart one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston goalkeeper rebuffed all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul of hand.
The Livingston "phenomenon" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Stunning performance and results for Livingston.
They have all been excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this upward slope.
Their style and team composition have hardly changed since their return to the top, but the merit largely goes to Holt for having motivated a team since his arrival.
which has many great players.
Captain Halkett’s defense was grandiose and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they have not lived up to their past talent.
They missed one last chance and managed to pierce the opposing side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed welcome of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, the Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Various issues were addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering outside the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of mostly Kurdish anti-Erdogan protesters made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to his country.
The rift emerging from the protests reflects Erdogan's double vision: a visitor welcomed as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and described as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. local time, near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, rescue arrived at the scene, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred several months after a cyclist died on Chiders Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
London police said officers were making every effort to identify the individual and warn his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been set up. It is advisable for motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in riot
The head of the high-security men's prison said six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialized anti-riot agents were sent to unblock the situation, involving 8 detainees and held in a prison wing.
On site, the officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison’s management said: “Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will have to answer to the police authorities and will be able to see their sentences extended.”
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are incarcerated in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized following an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-riot agents were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden flooding (which could be beneficial to drought-affected areas)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week. Hurricane Rosa is heading towards the southwest desert with what remains of energy. This region could be hit by sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, with heralding rains as early as Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the depression or tropical storm stage within a 300-km perimeter of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stopped 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm of rainfall, and up to 15 cm in locations in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to have 2.5 to 5 cm of rainfall, with isolated total measurements of up to 10 cm.
Rosa’s rains could be life-saving for drought-affected areas that are not at risk of sudden flooding.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, rainfall could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring system, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second most severe category,” reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa begins its journey on the coast, in the peninsula of Lower California.
Still of great power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm encounters the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall could be massive and could lead to a risk of flooding.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Lower California in northwestern Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, crossing Arizona and southern Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
“Torrential rains are expected in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert and are the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted homicide after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m. local time.
He's been sent to the hospital and his condition is stable.
Police in Avon and Sommerset said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night on the side of Radstock.
Officers made an appeal to people who may have filmed the scene with their phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been a victim of Democrats’ wickedness and anger
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous methods,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been a victim of the wickedness and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke out in Congress on Thursday, emphatically and emotionally rejecting the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses her of sexually assaulting her several decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that “the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage” that day.
“A vote in the direction of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the direction of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he referred to the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to a Republican party collaborator's statement to CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them carried away by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when waves six meters high overwhelmed the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything on their way.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not flee immediately, it cost them their lives,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not arrive alone, it dragged cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it," Nugroho said, noting that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he adds.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have amplified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, the damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of ruined buildings, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be greater on the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications were “completely paralyzed” since Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could well get worse,” she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to release information that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was released.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the floor of a building frantically screaming at passers-by on the street as a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a wall of water fell on the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army has begun transporting aid by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has reopened as part of relief operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit Palu evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami is increasing, there are more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
Donggala’s World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters set up in the backyard of their offices, and along the way they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When aid groups began to provide relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers had not been allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that is not yet the case.
“This disaster is still considered regional,” says Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting.”
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami hit Palu on Friday, the relatives of the missing people were still hoping for a miracle.
On Saturday, a small boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman buried under the rubble for two days, near the body of her mother.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach Gendon Subandono had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mandagi added.
“As an elder in the paragliding discipline, I’ve experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the paragliding community, Gendon said he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages remained unanswered.
“I don’t think they ever received my messages.”
In Newport on the Levee, thieves steal $26,750 when reloading a vending machine
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's agent who was recharging a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Service press release.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a dispenser in the entertainment complex and preparing to power it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the vending machine.
Witnesses reportedly saw many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with identity information should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: “Formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before heading to the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled his arrival for "emotional reasons," the show's creator explained.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional nickname, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us.
I went from Kanye, which means “the only one,” to Ye – the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also played on the hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO says it will never use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians, nearly 50 years after bloody law enforcement retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Square to “never use military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by providing monthly student allowances and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of education opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is increasingly active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. is expected to double its research funding, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several U.S. government actors made AI-related announcements, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the U.S.
At the same time, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are ahead of the United States, and we’re looking for the next big AI discovery,” Lee says.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next key step in AI comes from the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, then joined the management team of Microsoft Reasearch and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has previously participated in U.S. government-organized technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, to identify the visionaries.
According to Lee, U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that owns the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited major academic names to work on AI.
Lee added that changes to immigration policies could also support U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,” he says.
The State Council of China unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China is providing funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US legislation that works to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has taken no action for several months.
Macedonians take part in referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia made their voices heard in a referendum on changing the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would affect the ethical identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% turnout required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union, which means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, while it had reached 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of registered voters after the poll.
“I have come to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the name change, in order to open their voices to NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and has seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big gate,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, accession to NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments; the unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after filing his ballot.
He added that a “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian channel Telma, estimated participation at 57%.
70% of respondents intending to vote said they would vote "yes".
For the referendum to be valid, it takes 50% of the vote plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero breaks his way through Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in Manchester and won the 2-0 match Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentinian scorer received the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before diving into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He bypassed one defender before ousting the others close to Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to fool Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, told reporters.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that point.”
But it was Sterling who had given the initial advantage to the Skyblues in the Premier League game.
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the field of Brighton.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The front of the Skyblues sent the ball into the nets just before sliding off the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the trouble games against the Rockies
As the Nationals were eliminated from the play-offs, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in the event of a playoff for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their top division title.
“While this game doesn’t have any stakes, we want to step on the pitch in Denver, with that atmosphere, with the crowd, and in front of a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce a pitcher leaving for Sunday, but would be inclined to leave Scherzer's place, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a point-earning average of 2.53 and 300 draws on 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation generated by his support for Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“All of our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s a major challenge. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever, which is why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“You can see it over the last four days,” he added, before calling Democrats “angry, mean and lying.”
He referred to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which has led to him being sniffed out by the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no. I expect one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community it once was.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a line of Labour MPs who are not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received the same treatment because she stood up against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour rally notification Friday said, “We want the rally to be inclusive and productive.”
That was exactly what the Friday night general assemblies were during my eight years as a Labour MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case with many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into consideration.
It became clear that contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took power, and the colleagues with whom I thought I shared the same political vision began to expect me to turn my jacket around and take positions that were contrary to my beliefs, whether it was about national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I was saying, there was an abusive tirade on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me were political in nature.
I am in admiration for the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a surge of sexist or racist remarks every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the normalization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and the party is constrained by the motions of distrust and the changes to the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years: to look down, not express my ideas so hard, and everything would be fine.
But that's not how I do politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the negligence of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom, and since then I've been eager to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my political ambitions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with current party leaders.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services, and I think this is not really a time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the causes that I stand for, which are your interests at all.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the riding of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains undefeated
Two late trials may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph following the intense day game of the Scottish Rugby XV Championship.
The team now tops the rankings and becomes the only undefeated team in the championship.
In the end, it is the superiority of their defense and the way they are seized the opportunities that have allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this game.
“So far, we’ve been tested, but we’re still undefeated, so I have to think of myself as happy!” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie congratulated Ayr: “Congratulations to them, they’ve been more effective than us and have been able to seize the opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for Scottish squad Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to get the numbers to talk.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the halftime. He scored and transformed a solo test to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, narrowed the gap to five points.
This resulted in a long wait due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher. During the recap, Ayr took the lead again with a try by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, acting captain of Ayr, then received a yellow card and, again, Melrose tried his luck with an untransformed essay from Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team took over and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tacking Climo while he didn't have the ball, since the penalty kick, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's maul, which was progressing.
Climo transformed the test, as almost every time since the recovery, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry away for the team's fifth test at home.
The star of Still Game launches in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to make a career in catering. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he writes and co-animates with his longtime partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series that arrives will be the finale of the show, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing catering environment".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling in an armored boat at Naval Headquarters La Paz.
Public buildings carry a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motorcycle: “The sea is rightfully ours.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coast lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still present, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable in several decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which will be rendered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of the Bolivian request. Bolivia wants that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile be required to negotiate the agreement on a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile, and that little would change, even if a positive decision were made.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its decision six months after the latest arguments shows that the case “was not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even harmed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’s bellicose rhetoric undermined all the goodwill that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very complicated to hold talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also disputed the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we need to get rid of the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's foreign minister, said his country will not discard its nuclear weapons until it has confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to relaunch nuclear diplomacy in the deadlock more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it’s “chimistic” to think that maintaining sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean War will bend the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of any prior significant disarmament measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness over the relinquishment of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is debated.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest headwear trends, perhaps soon available in your stores
If you want to add XXL coins to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun at 100%, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of delusional oversized hats at a PE19 fashion show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Hats all more extravagant than each other have invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators have decided to incorporate their delusional pieces into the shows.
Valentino's flagship piece was a beige eccentric hat adorned with a wide edge evoking a feather, which engulfed the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included watermelons adorned with jewelry, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces weren't designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had lips stitched and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than Haute-Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, with snorkel and glasses, while another resembled a melted ice cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you’re in luck.
According to style observers, the imposing hats could come up to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the footsteps of the Bomba, the wide-brimmed straw hat that stars tear off, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hard-to-wear hat that flooded social networks has presented another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a handle of white leather, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus’s PE19 La Riviera show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m expecting to see the big hats and beach bags arrive in stores next summer. The designer has so marked the minds that it’s obvious that there will be demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the world’s citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with new excellent exam results reinforced by collective and individual achievement in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they have chosen and for their place as world citizens.
As an education sector able to design and implement a bespoke curriculum, we see that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you speak to his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If you look at the excellent test scores this year, you can see that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade, A.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of the pupils obtained the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as did the 72% of pupils who studied German, the 69% of pupils who studied French and the 63% of pupils who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and youth in the future.
From now on, languages as subjects are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the British Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers face difficulties in recruiting candidates due to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter their career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with strangers will automatically put the multilingual person in front of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not speak a foreign language enough to hold a conversation; French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those from emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the United Kingdom in 2020, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with specialist staff in the field.
Scottish independent schools want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that today, in a global business environment, languages remain of paramount importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his Lakers debut Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his Los Angeles Lakers debut.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday, in the pre-season opening, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited few minutes.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked for his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump is launching a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stopovers, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote for the vacant Supreme Court postponed, Trump seeks to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault hearings this week, and Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate is expected to be postponed for up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings is primarily aimed at helping Republicans gain ground in preparation for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives."
“Congressional control is such a critical element of his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of this busy election campaign,” a spokesman for the Trump team told Reuters, which declined to be named.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's meeting, scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, could bring together supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and grab the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to revive him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team ready to fight to keep hope as Sunday’s singles approach
After three singles, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes could well represent what was missing at this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing movement is a sporting concept invented from scratch but which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this one.
Where would they find the momentum now?
“They were leading with six points and now four, so it gives us a bit of wings,” Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points ahead and another twelve to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a bit of a wind in the stern and have every reason to be encouraged, notably by Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and can boast of having each scored three out of four points.
Spieth proved terribly effective from tee to green and set an example.
The energetic shouts of joy intensified as his game progressed, a crucial putt allowed him to equalize to the fourth half as he and Thomas were led two down after two holes.
His putt, thanks to which they won the game in the 15th hole, has sparked a similar cry, from those who tell you that he believes the American team is still in the race.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on our game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players right now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as evidenced by the Ryder Cup history.
The strange but adorable European pair has won four out of four games and is not entitled to the mistake.
Not only were “Moliwood” the only ones not to perform a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to flow between them and the delirious crowd designates them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to delight in a potential European victory as the sun sets on the National Golf.
Preferably, the two at the same time at different holes.
But talking about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat morning fourball hero Sergio Garcia while teaming up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, no one is here to help.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between pairs, the advice they give and those they don’t give, and how a strategy can tip over in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a considerable lead over the last day, but this foursome session also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, something some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning it 10-6 over the United States in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods in distress, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to keep the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by beating 3-1 in the morning fourballs against a disorderly U.S. team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the foursomes and won two wins, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 on Sunday in the singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and he, dubbed "Molliwood" after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they beat the pair composed of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of an even more categorical 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through both games on Saturday, shone a few times, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well rested for the morning fourballs, teamed up with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world standings.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 win against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, the latter having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, which held the crown, only had to draw to keep its trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament cannot be done unilaterally without trust.
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that maintaining sanctions reinforced his distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
At the World Organization's Annual General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho claimed that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" last year, such as ending nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and its commitment not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known reproaches over Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had supposed.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the very first summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls to loosen tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. insists that North Korea first proceed with denuclearization and exacerbate pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, even opposing “the declaration of end of war.”
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us ploy don’t know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our distrust.”
Ri made no comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted before the United Nations by the US leader earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party concerned with the issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles at North American territory after "evil" President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year at the United Nations to "totally destroy" North Korea, has not quenched praise this year for the courage with which Kim has applied disarmament measures, but added that much remains to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
“It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” Trump said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that “the application of Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its “gangster methods.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the U.S. takes “equivalent measures.”
According to the South Korean president, Kim is demanding the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest classes
This year, Harvard University has put in place a new course that allows all undergraduate students to sleep more and fights the growing macho trend of studying by consuming caffeine all night long.
One professor noticed that most students at the world’s best university don’t know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him
In the end, a student came up and said, "Why are they telling me this only in the last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dormitory containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books...) on which students click to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know this won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, in our opinion, they have the right to know this information – in the same way that you have the right to know what the health effects of smoking are,” added Professor Czeisler.
According to him, the culture of the pride of “a blank night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Having enough sleep and good quality should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said — even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making them starving all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and pushed him to insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar curriculum before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers suffered another hard blow away, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to Livingston's 1-0 loss.
The Ibrox team hoped to record their first on-the-go win since their triumphant 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team drifting, eight points behind the Hearts, the Ladbroke Premiership leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the uninspired Rangers team failed to equalize.
As the Rangers now drop to sixth, Livingston rises to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, as referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after throwing an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, meanwhile, picked the same Livi 11 that snatched a point from the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team stifling their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession of the ball, but Livingston has done more.
They should have scored two minutes away, when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but defending teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalized after the free kick when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only took advantage of two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike from Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening score in the 34th minute was against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed in the face of Jacobs' stopped kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to choose Menga for an end in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted to the half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange almost had an immediate impact when the winger showed up in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingston has nonetheless continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls over long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the final moments, but McGregor managed well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while struggling with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TOURNAL COMPUTER... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man: “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
With these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: “Say, that’s for sure!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
New cancer vaccine allows immune system to ‘detecte’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine allows immune system to ‘detecte’ cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory.
They can then “detecte” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose purpose is to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “causes an increase in several types of cancer”, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to “teach” them to target cancer cells, has been proven in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Dressed in a MAGA cap, Kanye West jumped into a Pro-Trump diatribe after joining the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was on the set after a raging performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump at a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for election in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang wearing a Make America Great Again cap, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He’s racist!’”
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The show began with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don’t know if Rock ever heard West mocked with this post.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that cap on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say I'm in a pit," he says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see him, the chasm?” and claimed that he would wear his cape as a superman, because no one can dictate his actions to him.
Try the love.”
At least twice, his comments drew a stir from the public, and members of the SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reports. One person on the scene told the magazine: "A silence of death fell on the entire set."
West had been called in to replace singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disarrayed a lot of people by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from Conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU for holding your head in the foul.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s host, tweeted that West was simply “faithful to himself, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and pours out an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we, too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the legendary late Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, then that of the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Prosecution of attempted murder after gun attack in restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday in a restaurant east of Belfast.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast's trial court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a thin blade, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took on the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that this kind of role on screen often leads young boys to pretend to be hard-boiled to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he said “something is wrong” and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old, admitted he was "strongly" interested in tackling this issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have mistreated masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught the young men who become adults in relation to the problem that now arises?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of his very masculine characters.
He continued: “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and the street teach young boys to think they have to behave like that to be a man?
I believe this is really one of the fundamental questions of our time – how can we change that?
There’s obviously something wrong.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or sequels when the series ends next summer, claiming to have finished with "the battlefields and the horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a cover of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life from now on,” he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 per cent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most patients have been contaminated during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has spread rapidly in parts of the country as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has pledged, since 2003, universal access to HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee disclosed data on senators, and denounces “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages devoted to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were supported by experts and “far-right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and yet more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by a stranger at Capitol Hill during the Senate session on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“My team member, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.”
“This false allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press attaché.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be provocative.
It must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at the Waters headquarters during the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the law enforcement authorities and departments concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are unmasked,” she added, “and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English hit again. Parody of Rowan Atkinson, under-endowed spy
It has now become a tradition to look for the scope of Brexit in every new British film and this seems to apply to this reprise of the action comedy Johnny English, which debuted in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the comeback.
Will ironic self-satire on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent our country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with crisp eyes and a rubber face, has seen his license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicating above all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-Anglophone cinematic audience.
Of course, he's the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious glamorous charmer attempts, possesses a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr. Bean, and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Fire Carts at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
Originally, he was also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades hit briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, although humour is rather insufficient and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses like 007 and Mission Impossible compose themselves confidently with the comedy.
Humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and to me Johnny English’s weird misadventures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson’s silent movie gags in the Bean character.
The perpetually current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker has infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agents on duty - an unfortunately small-scale role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the drop that makes the vase overflow for a prime minister who is a pompous character on the verge of crisis and who already suffers from a political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character quasi-Teresa-May, but there is not much to put under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, she will have to take someone out of her retirement.
This means disturbing Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic establishment as a schoolmaster, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few nice jokes here, as English offers a Rock Academy-style espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and finds Bough, his former long-term partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who create big trouble for Her Majesty's secret services, return to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the grip of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of far-fetched jokes: under the guise of servers, they set fire to a bright French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxurious sailboat; and English unleashes a real anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality helmet, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are assured for this last sequence, but despite everything, there are a lot of things for the children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't help but think, as with the other Johnny English films: can't the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Labour Party denies having devised a plan so that the British could work four days but that they would be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week — but get paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to give workers the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while still earning the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to steer the country in favour of the workers.
The shift to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “It is planned that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.”
“It won’t be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party’s approach to rebalancing the working-class economy and its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day workweek is not a party policy and is not envisaged by the party.”
Acting Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to give details of his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power in the hands of "anonymous directors" and "profiteers" in public utilities.
The Acting Chancellor's plans also provide that current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full stakes as the Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed his plan to integrate workers into the boards of directors of companies as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will pocket up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 in dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"As I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when those allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to be carved in stone.
“I made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she names couldn’t verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which first took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or making any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen organization still achieve its goal in the remaining twelve years?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of “clictivism” – a situation in which people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who advocate for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have helped incite world leaders to make commitments and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor-executor partnership committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” while promising <0xC2><0xA3>35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition program, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the undertaking of more than 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on her website, “What makes you think it’s possible to end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “The road to this will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will do it because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to perform this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
US could appeal to Navy to create ‘blockade’ to hamper Russian energy exports
In order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, Washington may “if necessary” call on the US Navy, revealed Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – notably where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East for the purpose of negotiating energy as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
“The United States, with our Navy, can ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not put on the market,” he added.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "speaker of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually identical.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option lies more or less in the exploitation and replacement of fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “more than one rope to its bow” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has pledged to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper solution for European consumers.
To do so, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “inappropriate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow has pointed out that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said “I believe we share this view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The U.S. position has provoked negative reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the United States not to be involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements concluded between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top,” she says, according to The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public rally, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been candid in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe she is expected to run in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favor of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Other prominent names for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSD during Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is currently experiencing, what he is feeling when he comes home, I can connect him to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a “taboo subject” and said about his son and other veterans that “they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if we respect what their comrades and air force members, and every other military, have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police service, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a relationship of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon.
18 States and District of Columbia support judicial challenge to new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a judicial challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a memorandum in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had assaulted her, but U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeal Board, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
"Federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be considered based on the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," the amicus curiae said in its memo.
The lawyers also argued in the memo that the policy of refusing immigrants to enter harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fear on the grounds of race, belief, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
“Asyl has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people face every day around the world.”
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more dramatic.
“I feel very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her feverish little boy in Palu, at an evacuation center in the emptied city.
“At every moment an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen going to their destroyed homes, picking up soaked goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fractured back and shoulders, rested in front of the Palu military hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to strong persistent aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but after the silence.
I don’t know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” Through “Propaganda Ads”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in an American newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the surcharge paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China refutes.
In accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in the US election, Trump marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
At the start of the trade war, China’s tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is doubling its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by inserting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad writes.
“By contrast, at the Beijing press desk, you will find few protesting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese may have on China’s troubling economic trajectory, as the media is firmly obedient to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, without saying what newspaper.
Analysts Warn Republicans Are Alienating Electors As Midterm Elections Approach Due to Kavanaugh Debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, said "you can't go back."
Reeher added that he doubted that the last-minute efforts of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favor of an FBI investigation were enough to quell the anger of voters.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, Mic reports, protesters sang "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be disproportionate,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, that’s right.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the reaction would be likely to be vivid if Republicans pushed forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier last week that “it has become a confusing mess for the GOP.”
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s appointment, it’s also about how Republicans handled the situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the newspaper.
Following Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning on the latter’s side.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of those surveyed believed absolutely or probably Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court candidate would have shown him his genitals during a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that leverages the free platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved and who is authorized to access this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was aiming to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the launch.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data store” or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in a single browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this “personal responsibility via data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few developers working on the project on contract, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not yet in discussions with "Facebook and Google" about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upended in an instant.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the “mission [of Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem with the aim of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to have received the Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was unaware that he had received the highest British military distinction.
Her two grandsons unveiled a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s feat.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion on the St. Quentin Canal “through very thick fog and under the violent fire of field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and, with the "greatest bravery", guided the line before blowing up a field gun on his own and beating three soldiers of the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something that I will never be up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support that will be given to him by many people.”
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine that, you spent the whole night watching a well-filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main sheet, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy that they remained awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for combat.
A Twitter supporter described the move to children’s cartoon as “some kind of bad joke.”
Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications Dave Schwartz said, “The government’s regulation states that at 6 a.m., this content was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
<0xC2><0xAB> "Peppa the pig", yes. »
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they will work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about rebroadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program switched, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried to give more to the fans and we messed up everything.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality – but it gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to high school that “not everyone [was] like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The show's usual presenter, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of her illness.
Appearing as a shipwreck on Laverne's first show, Daley confided that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
“To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medalist is now a renowned LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The triple world champion claimed he wasn't "expecting" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so many things at such a young age" - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, I was just thinking about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Daddy, you won’t be here to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I was holding him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and die before I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired her to choose her first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied her in the Olympic preparations and still gave her the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., BST.
Mickelson out of shape on Ryder Cup bench Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to rectify himself to avoid an unfortunate stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the biannual competition for the twelfth time, a record, was dismissed by captain Jim Furyk from Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time champion has shared his day between the role of enduring and fine-tuning his game at the stand in order to remedy his ailments.
He has never been the greatest of the leaders, even at the height of his career. At 48, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes the misplaced shots.
And as if the course wasn't fearsome enough in itself, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four games.
If the Americans, four down at the start of the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he could not say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a slap in the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in him.
He’s a legendary champion and he’s added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it went and that's how we felt we had to proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great guy to have in the team room.”
“I think younger players have had fun competing with him this week, which was fun to see.
He does more than just play.”
European national team captain Thomas Bjorn knows the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the singles of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult course.
The Dane played his first game in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but eventually rose to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding us that we were leading largely at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but fairly,” said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Ranking win 5-3 at both Friday and yesterday at Golf National to lead 10-6.
"History will prove to me and to all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Go to the bottom of it tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, to try to win this trophy, and that's what we need to stay focused on.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s going on on the other side – they’re the best players in the world.”
Excited by the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never move on to this point.
Tomorrow, it's a whole other pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it will be the individual performances that will be presented and it is quite different.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re put to the test to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players score better individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these last-day turnarounds, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before losing at the end of the “Miracle of Medina,” where Europe tore away the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to take this quick start as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought we should, we’re trying to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I’ve accompanied this group of guys in that order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship still postponed
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but worrisome problems after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging frigates of the Bremen class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for up to two years outside of home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the forward-thinking warships - which should allow Germany to project its force overseas - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the cursed F125 frigate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and hardware defects” that rendered the warship useless in the event of deployment on combat missions.
The software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which decreases its performance and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Beyond the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to 2.2 billion initially.
The problems associated with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval force is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the navy is in fact “out of ships able to deploy”.
The official said the situation had produced a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
New research on an area in the Scottish Highlands seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common pipistrels and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton in Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross.
Special registration devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will help determine the frequency of bat cries as well as the activities of different species.
A map and habitat report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how these are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by the construction and development work that affect the perches and lead to the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by companion cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to spot insects and obstacles on their flight path.
Responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings, 38 large gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, perch inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of the domain, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave, we have an ideal spot for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what bats need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before proceeding with the maintenance of the properties, because by unintentionally destroying a single maternity nest, it could result in the death of 400 females and young, or even the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or destroy their perches.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and as far as many of our species are concerned, we don’t know what’s going on in their populations right now.”
Ronaldo refutes rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him “false information” and claimed that people “want to make themselves known” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep silent on the incident, Der Spiegel said last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations aired, Ronaldo, 33, called the news “false information.”
“No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well,” the player added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called an “inadmissible denunciation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms hotel-casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape allegedly occurred, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "good guy" at "99%" but that he didn't know what was going on with the "1%" remaining.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that these were consented to.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted an amicable settlement because she felt "terrified by reprisals" and feared "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to rescind the settlement as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged assault, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve as part of a €100 million contract.
Brexit: The UK would “forever regret” the departure of automakers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State in charge of Commerce, the United Kingdom would “forever regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain withdrew from the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles – built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are about what automakers call risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tense flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted.
According to Clark, Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated in order to avoid these border controls.”
“We need an agreement, we want the best deal that will, as I said, allow us not only to take advantage of the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC’s Radio 4’s Today.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has turned out to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
While Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be shut down, it warned that in the longer term, the additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the Unite union at the factory and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that its members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs disappear, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House Announces Trump-Rosenstein Meeting May Still Be Delayed
According to the announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents significant issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred by a week,” while the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special adviser charged with investigating Russian interference in the elections, ties between Trump's collaborators and Russia, and possible obstacles to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a mic in order to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he appeared at the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Commission hearing before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if we’re pushing back another week given all the other things that happen in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The claim would be disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the scarcity of the lectures was not due to a dislike for "demagogic" television reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they amazed the gallery."
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We’ve checked the numbers.”
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the chance to question the president of the United States directly, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it frequently, you have seen it in the last few weeks, and it’s going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are solo press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual and at times a bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On Brexit fears, Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and wish them to remain in office after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and are expected to result in decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is quite your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery
Tennessee State's Sselon Mike Organ, Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' sidekick, had emergency surgery after a head injury Saturday in the Vanderbilt Commodores' 31-27 loss.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the touchline and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing it on a stretcher and taking it for another examination.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said there was "no information yet about the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student athlete, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five total touchdowns on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duties if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative regimes.
This measure will nullify the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This move will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by committing to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will be used to bolster the government's efforts in the fight to help the homeless.
This surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-residents in the UK, which drives up prices and prevents first-time buyers from gaining a place in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - notably in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who stay most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people acquire a first home.
Accusing major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by grabbing land without using it, he called on Ms. May to waive affordable housing quotas in an effort to address the “real estate disgrace” in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of proposals for reform in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the elimination of “faultless” evictions.
It also wants to give the councils wider powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to the rebirth of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for non-UK individuals, as it is for foreign companies, to buy a home as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of accessing property has become remote and the misery of the homeless remains too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland technician Jack Ross says his “ultimate ambition” is to become the Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is pleased to take up the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which is currently third in Ligue 1, three points behind the leader.
He joined Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that’s something I’ve never forgotten.
This opportunity, however, would only arise if I succeeded in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic technician says he has not hesitated to line up behind such iconic names at such a large club, having already declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I managed to get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of coaching career, after a period as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months with Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa climb up from a relegation to the third division and turned St Mirren, who was on the verge of relegation, into the championship big winner the following season.
Ross feels more comfortable now than during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s management “was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach was better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I did well, made a good living and enjoyed some appreciable heights.
Playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to settle each week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my entire adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has pushed up revenues from struggling British pubs, but has exacerbated pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that the bars and pub groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but revenue in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the data, said: “The permanent sunshine and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup made July follow the pattern of June, when bars had experienced a 2.8% increase, except for restaurants, which suffered an even greater shock.
The 1.8% decline in June in the catering sector only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than restaurants that fall.
Food pubs also suffered from the effects of the sun, but not as much as restaurateurs.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the off-home market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8% on an annual average is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long and warm summer could not have been less opportune for food operators and the weather will tell us whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will afford a well-deserved respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in implementation.
Industry sales are monitored by the UK Pub, Bar and Restaurant Coffer Peach Tracker, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry standard.
On social media, one in five children has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
According to a survey, one in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in “fake Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “primary” account to show to their parents
One in five children – some of whom are only 11 years old – opens a social media account that he keeps hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported managing a cleaned “main” account to show to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally stumbled onto her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager who was inciting others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, with half of students acknowledging having private accounts.
WSC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in athletics and President Ian Beattie has described this choice as an excellent opportunity for athletic leaders to build on his extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit tremendously from his participation on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 1996 200m and 400m at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a tough job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!”
Online, a breast pump ad that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertisement from a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what is known as the “world’s first silent breast pump,” Elvie, a consumer technology company, has launched a bold music video-inspired ad to show the freedom its new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a cow barn filled with hay, four real mothers dance to the rhythm of a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm cheating myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, it's my breasts, not nipples."
The chorus continues: “Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women milking the milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “horrors.”
“A poor decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days after they are born,” she wrote.

Another commented: “This is an understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are keeping their baby?”
Someone else added, “An advertisement so disconnected.”
Others defended the advertising, for example a woman admitting that she found the song " hilarious."
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented, "It's a fun advertisement for moms who suck their milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like 'cows'.
It’s not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal dancing with the discreet breast pumps hidden in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while drawing their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast milk extraction and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new breastfeeder will provide.
This is not the first time that Elvie has made headlines.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Settle in Texas Border Camp
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly because the Trump administration’s harsh speeches and policies have made it more difficult to place children in respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants, and they feared compromising their own possibility of staying in the country by going to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult household members should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified to Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Almost 80% of respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people,” said Mr. Albence.
According to shelter stakeholders, in order to deal more quickly with children, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible will be promptly deported.
According to stakeholders and reports presented in recent months by the shelter network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large facility like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to child rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have a hard time managing.
Syria is calling on the US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately.
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “would be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, as more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “conduct this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purged” from both terrorist groups and any “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said conditions were favorable for the refugees to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational concerns” that deterred the refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to ensure that these returns are facilitated,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war is concluded.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress in Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale assault on the province where three million people live, by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement provided for "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military measures would target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, a representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee bringing together members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the group’s work should be limited to “revision of the articles of the current constitution,” and formulated a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal lead him to leave his presidency prematurely.
This would be “the most spectacular finale of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, rush hour odds have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have practically tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” which reaches 3.5 million viewers at peak evenings, is the premier cable TV channel.
"It's a case that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor," who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comic author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about slipping into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
Chaos has a playful value.
Of course, unlike anything on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can come together and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep know-how” for his book “Fear,” on the $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket worn by Paul Manafort (“a garment full of pride” according to the Washington Post’s M.D.M.A.’s extrah.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
“If part of what he’s doing feels like watching a reality TV show, it’s because he’s making you swallow something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and day-to-day turnarounds.
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was landing inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the days when we were animating all these crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside invades the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is being flooded with money, thanks to a readjustment of Congressional constituencies that allowed two incumbents to compete for the same seat.
This suburban district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps the new 17th District.
The cards were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former boroughs were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district kicked off a clash over the financing of election campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close win last March in a very popular special election in the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then declined
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, to which Washington was little opposed.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to convene the heads of US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only planned against El Salvador, which received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control narcotics and provide it with development and economic support.
The sanctions envisaged, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings continued, representatives of North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now speaking at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
Their comments were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Studying History
The next tile could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible impediment to justice. The public file is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mueller would also direct his investigation towards the question of collusion of Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If congressional control changes, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body as he prepares to stand before voters and perhaps a jury of his peers.
These are many “ifs,” and I’m not claiming that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these splits.
What will we do if Mr. Trump sends Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly register the president and speculated on his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“What will we answer if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial — or if he is confiscated in the Supreme Court despite sexual assault allegations and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as an ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With this legacy, I can’t help but be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienne
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first appearance of the season until a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to make the most of such a result for feats.
“It was a positive point for us because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old forward.
“We got into the game thinking about getting something and we left with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a tough game because they did a good result in their last game, nevertheless I am sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
“Last year has been really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can move forward now, leave last season behind and triumph.”
Women can no longer sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings
While the survey participants were clear on how they wanted to be cared for, few people raised the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the national study said they were talking with their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they told their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do what it takes to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care financing decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a buyback value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover those expenses, or other insurance on your assets - as long as you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in passing.
Provide a health care proxy that will allow you to appoint a trusted person to check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are hit with disability.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Put that plan in place.”
A man has been wounded several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received several bullets fired with a compressed air rifle as he walked home from an evening.
The victim, in her mid-40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, at the time she was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries did not threaten his life and the police issued a call for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the toll is expected to increase.
As communications were stalled, rescue services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that runs more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Circle of seismic fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
A few hundred people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 rocked the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami more than 10 meters long that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake rocked the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami has been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a report of domestic violence and resistant to arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in pre-trial detention at Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Centre and is held on unsecured $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, that's for sure" when his plea was asked, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year's imprisonment and is liable to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a minor class B offence, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case is ongoing in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the report of a crime of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His wife said he had hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake that rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the casualty record is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake broke out just off central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media show the point of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time of the tsunami on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Call for Rare Death Penalty for Person Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York attacker who killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been enforced in that state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing pedestrians and a cyclist on his road last October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" murdered the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “careful preparation and premeditation,” prosecutors said, calling Saipov’s method “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed the death penalty in the course of a ten-year lawsuit.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for engaging in acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he was happy with his actions.
Saipov told authorities he was incited to commit the attack after watching videos of Daesh on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of Daesh in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to take legal action.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his plea of guilt and sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all concerned,” said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to “mobilize the People’s Army” at a demonstration at the Conservatives’ conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians should “feel pressure” from eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested, he should be tasked with negotiating with the EU.
Backbench Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK “would have already been liberated” if Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the dilemma Ms. May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops has been underscored by Conservatives in favor of the idea of staying in the Union who have joined an isolated anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as from the EU.
Allies stressed that it would continue its attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities – and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its programme and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers."
He felt that Mr Farage should have become a partner and been entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: “We did not engage in world wars to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who favored the exit, was also present at the march to tell journalists: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is also the case of our party and our activists who traverse the streets and make us elect above all.
Give up checkers and start listening.”
In a message to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians must be “feel pressure” if they are about to betray the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to fool Brexit and we’re telling them today: “We’re not going to let you get out of it like that.”
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of activists waved banners of Conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues surrounding the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the computer systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of running in presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public assembly in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a voice often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters at a public assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come “for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman at the head of the state.”
Arrested in the shooting death of Sims from Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they had posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who was on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde took the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, in possession of a gun, and firing at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-metre-old who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, including 10 starting last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after team directives allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It quickly became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by beating Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team’s instructions would play an important role in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas took a good start and ran close to Hamilton on the side as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to embark on the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes passed through the stands a lap later and found themselves behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside at the risk of resisting after a double defense attempt in the third turn.
Max Verstappen left the last row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first round to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a speed finish and beating Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He eventually arrived in the stands in the 44th round, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen ranking fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said she had not disclosed the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but argued that the events taking place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest."
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“Seeing the disclosures and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you divulge any information?
Remember his response... did you release information - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I did not disclose anything."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we disclosed any information... No, we have not disclosed any information,” he added, thinking of the impression of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t disclose his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented Saturday night at the rally: “I’ll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were using these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the pettiness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars erased Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by taking home 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer gave the Giants back the lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, guaranteeing them the victory.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's players, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being caught.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two sides, with the Giants triumphing in the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan revived the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt started serving Cownie at 15:16, with an equalization.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening towards the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard again equalized with a goal giving a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal in the middle.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the region and large numbers of people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his post in the violently shaken tower at Palu’s Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He remained on site to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The toll would continue to grow as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu who will celebrate a mass funeral Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
“Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aircraft accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after a plane crashed in the lagoon.
The airline that handled the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man is missing, after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it has not been able to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to more specific requests for information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were involved in rescuing the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed too low.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes says.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to slip into the water until the plane sank.
he claimed that the flight attendants had panicked and screamed, and that he was suffering from a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade a wharf were also involved in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Air Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in registered airline accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday at the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone phone records to trace the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cellphones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's when he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to speak.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford replied that he was “[lying] because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers’s death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ texts, calls and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by imbuing their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The band wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from the mother who complained that she was “still a black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, and equates the prosecution with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was Black when she arrived for her first day at work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOON STILL HAS A BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Ms. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, explaining that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Philippine instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day’s work, then sent home by an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple to seek compensation for her removal and is seeking compensation of $350 a day for the six-month home service for which she was originally hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do that kind of thing,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying it was reasonable to end Mauritius’s employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after harming him.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assimilating the trial to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
“Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very pleasant thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors fear readers won't identify with a talking bear, new letter unveils
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It’s a lot of fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a small teddy bear, remained optimistic about the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had had a "sweet-bitter" flavor after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” adding that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a fairly calm man, and he wasn’t a pretentious one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeded: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we didn't expect her to get away with it," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to maintain his heart rate were slowly running out of his system.
She had died a while before and it all stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Lamenting women drop postcards to prevent suicides on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on a daily basis,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying, since he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a training effect."
Ms. Davis created the maps “to let people know that there are people you can go to see and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say he felt down, depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them or anything.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get away with it: “It’s heartbreaking for the family.
It destroys us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for -- a time-limited investigation, limited in scope -- maybe we could bring some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "collapse" into a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
The midterm elections will only take place in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans score poorly, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through him, his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary at the time.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide the vote and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters ‘falling’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions took place last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and increased tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters will ultimately be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the denuclearization negotiations that remained unresolved until then.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they broadly agreed to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will be the first to carry out unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unsuitable for Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved this way, they would have called her "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and sometimes almost screamed and choked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations concerning him a “grotesque and coordinated assassination” organized by disappointed Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, since he showed he was against Democrats.
“I think he discredits himself with these statements and the way he’s dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and whether Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but he’s also unfit to sit on the court where he currently is,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the DC Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a Conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh eluded the question of the possible reversal of certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger overflowing, and she can't get her out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, and you?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who told me she was crying when she was angry too, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to when she was angry and crying, ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most striking memories of a first job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying in an inexpressible rage, was being seized by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always terrified me - who dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they're thrilled because they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado Democrat, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they were missing was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was very advanced, she had been late in fundraising, so she vowed that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually donated $1,000 to men were planning to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’m entitled to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions — gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism — that she felt dizzy.
“You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled about the press’ reaction to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
“She cried?”
How the trade war between the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest rise came this week with new tariffs affecting items worth US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), taxing half of all goods from China arriving in the United States.
Each time, Beijing has responded in kind, most recently charging tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China is committed to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will wane soon.
To push Washington back is to give in to the demands, but to publicly give in to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing can properly play its role, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ‘prepared’ for return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions have now been met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid for the reconstruction of this devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn crossed the 14.5 point mark needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, pushed his start into the water in the 16th hole in par-3, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of four players to have ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, whose first edition dates back to 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5-4 by the European team's worst-placed player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best golfer in the world, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European champion with a total of 25.5 career points.
“In general, I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help him,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance about his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
“We’re going to regroup, I’m going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
We have to bow down.
We were overtaken.”
Red Tide Info Point: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decline in red tide concentrations in some areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which raises concerns about declining concentrations.
The red tide covers about 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee counties.
There are islets about 10 miles (16 km) off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer locations than last week.
Red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County have been reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations at the bottom of Sarasota County or offshore, medium concentrations in Charlotte County, and low concentrations at the bottom of Charlotte County or offshore, and low concentrations in Hillsborough County and offshore.
Cases of respiratory irritation persist in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
