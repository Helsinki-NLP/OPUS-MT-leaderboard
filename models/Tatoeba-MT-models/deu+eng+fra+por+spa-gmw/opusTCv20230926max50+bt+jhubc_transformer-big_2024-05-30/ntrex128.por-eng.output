Members of the Assembly of Wales are afraid to "pass through hammers"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Wales Parliament".
Some members of this House, from all political backgrounds, fear that this will make them ridiculous.
A Labour AM said the group is concerned that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Welsh readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "dumps".
A Plaid AM stated that the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was “open minded” about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w has a pronunciation similar to that of the Yorkshire English letter u.
The House Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the House are appointed will obviously be made by themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which received widespread support for the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the AM, the Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the committee system.
When they debate the legislation, AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s bells shut down at a time when Harlem churches are fighting for survival
“In a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, he understood.
“People socialize differently,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are headed regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of heritage may not last as long as the leaders expect” and that sooner or later everything will return to exactly the starting point.
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the remaining neighborhood shrines.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so that will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move into these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation came out of here in the 1930s.
The building was later taken over by a black congregation who performed their services in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but when plans for its reconstruction were made, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the chime.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the chime “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan said it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather stated that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin’s in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "would seek to pass on the costs", unhappily the fact that it was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on California lobster hunting dive
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster-hunting dive in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy scream for help, then rowed towards him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel claimed that he initially thought it was just enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier but considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetics, backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion apparel and household items decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be deployed in more stores next year if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand by supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space formerly used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty product catalog with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby stores have led to supermarkets now having to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, executive chairman of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses as the supermarket chain tries to combat discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, and has also installed a number of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and says this has boosted sales of grocery products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from health care stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
The company said Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Chief Commercial Officer, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit every need. On the other hand, the inviting atmosphere and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby gave up <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby dropped out of an 11-million-pound lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the brand of Truly homewares and accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones alive by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say Jones was "angry" when the golden TV girl admitted during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) implied that she would no longer have time to dedicate herself to her Truly household goods and accessories brand.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s highest priority.
It would mean the resolution of your future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely amazed.
Nobody believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is among Britain’s most lucrative celebrities, could cost the company millions, given the massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for further delays from the launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples take vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night that “we do not intend to comment on his business.”
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump claimed, in his fake voice, "telejournal pivot."
"I didn't give in at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, noting that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is pursuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
“It’s going very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of rocket tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for channelling international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is no guarantee yet that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly sighted on other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, in spite of the validity of a warning, would have contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made infrastructure improvement a centerpiece of his election campaign, has spent huge sums on roads and railroads.
However, funding shortages have plagued Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim bands fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long shot for Chelsea's draw goal
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea, with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, with his team losing 1-0.
He touched his left before making a shot toward the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving forward as much as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming in, I touched it and I didn't think too much about it, I just shot it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after scoring a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this play, the Blues forward gave a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking himself near the midfield and making a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick pass to midfield.
He then made a beautiful shot that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the wide area.
He overtook the defenses and scored against the net of the second goal with a shot with the left foot that passed Liverpool's goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Naples in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster response agency said earlier on Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people imprisoned in the wreckage of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an agency spokesman, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.

The Cromwell Statue of Parliament has become the latest monument swallowed by the controversy of “historical revisionism”
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for their destruction, reminiscent of that perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and that was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure at Westminster Palace would become a target to be shot down.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the opinion of the 19th century and part of historiography of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety who represents one side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration.”
Pig killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered in blood, near a market pit in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he has traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring piggy bank.
In that swamp, he said, was a big male pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, at 227 pounds, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking others while police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks by pigs on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 pounds immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare off the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can function as a "stimulus."
"They're just kidding.
They like to pinch, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the right respect,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, it will bring torrential rains to all of Mexico’s north and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa caused 137 km/h of gusts, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push strong tropical moisture northward in the southwestern part of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause rainfall that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous sudden flooding, flooding of debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause the gorges to turn into fierce rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy precipitation over parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small floods of debris and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainfall of the region’s wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can see strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, however, tropical areas will remain quite mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and widen again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to experience a hot start to October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures occurring in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched the gripping testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations yesterday.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with stations disrupting regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh tapped her while drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, a number Nielsen found on Friday, are likely to have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it were not yet available, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who view programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of audiences similar to the final of a football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all TV stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement stating that his vote would be in Kavanaugh’s favor, the senator was caught by CNN and CBS chambers on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator to address a Judiciary Commission hearing.
The senator remained motionless looking at the ground while being criticized live on CNN's cameras.
“I’m here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission went to vote to have Kavanaugh's appointment proceed for a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with a few other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politicizing' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and harming the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister's "Chequers Plan" for Brexit, saying that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the other side's tariffs is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Homicide: Police Detain Suspect Dyteon Simpson from LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree homicide, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, with police saying Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and stated that they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, reports WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, police reported that he had fatally shot Wayde with a firearm.
A bond of US$350,000 has been laid, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish’s medical-legal office issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department says the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police action group, the state police criminal laboratory, Southern University police and area residents who collaborated on the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked area officials for their “diligence and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
"This is what we are concerned about in permanence," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ashes in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano hit neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center detected numerous deaf noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windscreens of automobiles in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity from the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between Catalan police and separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked in by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually packed with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups who sang "We don't forget, we don't forgive" faced unionist protesters who shouted "Long Lives for Spain."
Fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, it can be read in the local press.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout was low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it was held, this manifestation was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was participating in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year, we had our best moments.
“I saw my parents cry with joy that they could vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year's elections.
"Presenting as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash in house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a home in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had occurred to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may have also fired a beast at the car.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, stunned the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss of just two in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which remains without an away win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended their succession of no-defeat games in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have advanced on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of trouble to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but allowed himself to be dragged in front of the goal and then Alan Lithgow only managed to steer his effort away after sneaking in to find Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was satisfied to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it could cause problems for the visitors in the stalled ball plays.
This is how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers gave a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the wide area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was thwarted by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a touch away from Livingston's other stalled ball play.
Crossings continued to come to the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two heavy penalty claims, one after Halkett's onslaught on substitute Glenn Middleton and the other after one hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to their maximum throughout the game.
In any case, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown at times with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
His final move was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Ambiguously Received in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to host him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southwest of the city, near 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the person and inform their families.
Barriers and detours were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Agents Injured in Disturbance
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The riots, which are still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one ward.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Services spokesman said: “Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (areas affected by drought may benefit)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is exactly what is predicted for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression state within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those unaffected by the risks of sudden flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation may be beneficial as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least from extreme drought, the second most severe category,” the report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass crossing the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at top speeds of 137 km/h, lies 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm is finding colder water in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Heavy precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall of 8 to 10 mm is expected from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm possible," the weather.com website reported.
Rosa will then head north, traversing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected hazard of the Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and the Southwest Desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden flooding and flooding of life-threatening desert debris and flooding in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, near 4:00 a.m. British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have appealed to everyone who can own cell phone footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "victim of malice and anger" from the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the Democratic Party’s relentless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "a victim of malice and anger" from the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people have witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation by one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior deputy of the Republican Party's leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; number continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters tall hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the event," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency to mitigate the effect of the Indonesian disasters (BNPB) said in a communication in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive shaking was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, the statement reads.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could make it much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building screaming frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to the people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to Palau’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's really bad.
While he managed to get safely to the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, Donggala’s World Vision staff went through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin the gloomy tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel may only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still at a provincial catastrophe level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
As the second night in Palu fell after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still-disappeared were still hoping that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that dim the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those imprisoned in the Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” she said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes from Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM replenishment in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While busy, another man "surfaced running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with identity information should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, received the nickname Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The move comes ahead of his participation on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", the creator of the show said.
Being at the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So, I am you, I am us, it is us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one", to only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
Military personnel fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have risen to 300, as leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving them monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its AI business, the U.S. is expected to double research spending, said investor and industry professional Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a formal global strategy on the matter.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it intends to lead AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's top-ranked American player. He later held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's branch in China.
Lee credited previous U.S. government technology competitions as the Department of Defense’s Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
U.S. investigators often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is stealing academic leaders; it’s the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work in AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I am of the opinion that AI doctorates should automatically be granted green cards,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense instituted a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that intended to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbor to the north represents a complaint about its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the voter turnout will be enough to meet the 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it in favor of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no records of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters appeared to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country’s name, which would open the doors for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads upright and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that joining NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the necessary influx.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, the turnout must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disarray in the pro-Western government’s policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses all of Brighton's defence towards goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the play.
He sprinted between Brighton's three defenses before cutting to reach the open field.
He was surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing others in the race on the edges of the Greater Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch on the wide area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League matchup.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in this play.
Passed over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This one gave a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field boundaries.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there wasn’t much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer has hopes of entering the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead from a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers at NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their top division title.
“Even though we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have yet to announce the starting pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the pitches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, had a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influx in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is on the line in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big...I’m not running, but I’m running and that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re watching this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re watching it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power using every means necessary. Do you see the evil, the sordidity?
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission to "resist and obstruct".
“And they’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “aggressive, evil, sordid and liars.”
The president referred to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as having received sound vacillations from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did it cause the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, hm no, I, wait, one -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion.
When Momentum activists from my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we have expressed our views openly.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that “we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were just that.
Unfortunately, today it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if ever.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect a turnaround from me and to take positions I would never agree with - whether they were on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on social media that call for “dismissal”, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me tend to be political in nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down from them.
One of the aspects that most disappoint me in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion for "censorship" or change of the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, so as not to be so expressive, and that thus "it would be all right" for me.
But that's not what I came here to do politics for.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my comprehensive school literally in rubble, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or as a minister in government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of “dismissal” or political expediency will prevent me from acting in what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow biased the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting game of Tennent's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the better, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, granted for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot enjoying an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a big penalty, before, just before halftime, he had scored and then converted a solo test to place the score at 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and the rehearsal of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported abroad on a stretcher and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced the lead with a rehearsal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted rehearsal by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense rush of pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having knocked down Climo without the ball, on the penalty throw, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind Ayr's progressing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent wing Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth rehearsal.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the catering business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to enter the catering industry after learning he was named director of a licensed catering company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and participates with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, soon to debut, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flowering Glasgow catering business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country devoid of coastline, expects the court to reopen a path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Getting him back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive, as is the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will witness the ICTY’s ruling being handed down on giant screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of their country’s complaint, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president’s votes were in August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that it would change little even if it did not.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the IJT’s sentence is handed down only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have harmed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility "to put an end to 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament unless it trusts the US
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never do without its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart deadlocked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “impossible dream” to consider that continued U.S. sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will ever lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set amazed at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad feather-like flap that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-peeled watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, though the same were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Styling observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a beach bag in straw almost as big as the swimsuit model that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange, adorned with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I’m waiting to see big hats and beach bags arrive in stores next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continuing in 2018 with another set of exceptional test scores, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for deepening their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a bespoke school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the highest grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and not only.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% were related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, with French the only language spoken by a double-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for children today.
Proficiency in several languages, particularly those in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding relevant employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future holds.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron kicks off Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans looking to see LeBron James kick off at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, head coach of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell posted a tweet stating that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's West Virginia rally
President Donald Trump kicks off a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nomination vote pending for the Supreme Court seat, Trump plans to bolster support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below on a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings of Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate’s planned confirmation vote will be on hold for a week as the FBI investigates.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a tough election in November, win some impetus.
President Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week are intended to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and broaden the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so critical to the president’s agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the hustle and bustle of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the early-night rally could attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a hand in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates strength to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a fully invented sporting concept, but it is one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impetus is coming now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so we're looking at that as a little bit of momentum, I'd say," Spieth said as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in the lead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and plenty of reason to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those guttural shouts of celebration became louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the 15th game produced a similar scream, of the kind that reveals that he still believes that the American team continues in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning back nine.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and into this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of fourballs this morning, when in team with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine stuck the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close due to the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session also demonstrated that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a slack lead after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday's games with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods struggling to make it to the four-point Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in the Sunday 12th singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to earn four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duet to earn four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who crawled for two games on Saturday, revealed occasional strokes of genius, but has already lost 19 of the matches he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe has not always taken the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of the top men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duo won a brave 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point draw before the singles, though the title-holder Furyk team only needs to tie to keep the trophy.
After two days in second position, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be beyond his possibilities.
North Korea Says “Don’t Think” of Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were exacerbating distrust of the United States and that there was no way for the country to unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test center and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding U.S. responses,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first.”
While Ri has recycled known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it made gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in that they do not marginally reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang’s earlier positions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States claims that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal coercively, opposing the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the stakeholder in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing North Korea’s rockets into U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump called Kim the “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said much more had to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for that, noting that “whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later declared that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, though North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes corresponding measures.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were security assurances taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep longer, in an initiative to combat the sexist culture of studying in caffeine-infused “directs.”
One professor concluded that students at that top university in the world often had no idea about the most basic concepts about self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?'
The young woman stated that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep to her, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as we all have a right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “doing straight” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough sleep and quality should be a “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid fattening, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, making them constantly starving.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical biology and chemistry, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm when going to bed, such as waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of sadness away from home when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team a 1-0 loss at Livingston Stadium.
The Ibrox team was looking to record their first win on their journey since their 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team eventually inflicted Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, leaving their team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish top division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, devoid of inspiration, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now coming down to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, and just behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
And even more problems could arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence has been treated for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven from Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-overwhelmed team suffocated opponents on every move.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with what he had.
The team could have scored just after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second bar.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a big quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson declined the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers managed only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected from the game's development, it is undeniable that the team earned it, let alone for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with a long-stop ball play from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the lateral forward moved to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the blockade.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett performing long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held out well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow topped out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton once again claimed a heavy penalty when he became entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is now 136 years old and continues to count ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like a uranium.
When we put these headphones in, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's crackling right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still lasts.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘see’ harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory.
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system how to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2. These cells are then again injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to that involving removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he began a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star teased Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the West's bravado scene was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to mock West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
I was told, "Don't go in there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see marginalization?", saying, "I'd put on my superman cloak, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments provoked public outbursts and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the newspaper, "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a rally of support from TPUSA director Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: “To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR AGAINST TURBA.”
Interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) that I believe I am welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "the one formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg once used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Throne War Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on the screen often make boys feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old partner in the War of the Thrones Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has a "very strong position" on tackling the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position at the moment: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they’re growing up in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not go into any prequels or sequels of the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battlefields and the horses" are over.
Starting in November, Kit will participate in a reissue of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on the land of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual year-on-year variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team posted personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on the allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and published the data of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters said.
“My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak.
This unfounded accusation is utterly false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot get angry.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It has to reveal calm and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will run for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Very serious if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had alerted “competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
“We assure you that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review Back to Attack - Weak Spy Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems to apply in fact to the new edition of the Johnny English action comedy film series, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his buzzing eyes and an overly elastic expression, obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comic creation aimed at non-Anglophone moviegoers.
He is, of course, the idiotic secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to a soft glamour, has a little bit of Cloiseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and something of that guy who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter carrying medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a chime noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that editions of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose the comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie numbers in the Bean character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a pitifully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and contentious figure, already suffering a total decay of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the plot does not give much material for large flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the active agents have been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And that's the crappy Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, as English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School of Rock".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering helper Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a fuzzy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin from the catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd, clumsy acts: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a colorful French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating as clandestines on Volta's luxurious yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to wear virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but as nice and stormy as it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but ask: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that they are devising a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide Britain with a four-day working week, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the salary.
Sources say the idea "would fit" into the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day workweek has garnered the Congress of Trade Unions’ favorable opinion as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We expect to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from the “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Its plans also include the failure to recover the entire share of current shareholders of water companies, given that the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees on the company’s boards of directors and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who will be able to pocket dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their minds or not
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"He said when he was going to the hearing," he said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this allegation came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, and unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
“I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will perform on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people in the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to watch performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful ways that contribute to raising awareness for the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of persuading them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clickivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have lobbied for a range of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, with at least $10 billion related to them already disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressures on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the nutrition level.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responds: “It’s been a long, tortuous road — sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use navy as a “blockade” to put a barrier on Russia’s energy exports
"If necessary," Washington may resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States and its navy have the ability to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade them to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “magic one-trick” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the by far cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic motives, an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “deeply examine” the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply examine” the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes one woman as the chief official,” she said.
“After November 6, I will thoroughly examine the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe's Center for Political Research.
32% support their candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy than former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated over a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually coming back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said his son and other veterans "return a little different, come back hardened, come back inquiring whether there is such respect for what his comrades soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the armed forces, have given to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and gun possession while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district sent an amicus curiae (friends of the court) statement on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against the policy in August has not been disclosed.
The woman said her partner “and her children, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. authorities dismissed her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” reads the amicus curiae statement.
The lawyers also argued in that statement that the police’s ban on immigrant entry negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in a time trial to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a febrile male baby, as she comforted him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save anything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated overseas due to the strong aftershocks that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertisements of propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily on the Des Moines Register, the state’s most-printed newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in Nov. 6 congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, called a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariff vacancies on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertisements in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of free speech and press freedom by publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“In contrast, in the stalls here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a real reflection of the disparity in opinions that the Chinese may have from their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could elicit a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have publicly stated that they intend to move forward with a vote.
These things have no setback,” said Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, to The Hill Grant.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to appease revolted voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they marched in the Senate hall, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already tall; it’s true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among indecisive voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony outlining his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as judge, it’s also about how Republicans dealt with it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they considered that Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her as an alcoholic when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two were attending a party during the period they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary tech character, Inrupt, is a company leveraging Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt’s underlying intention is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data warehouse,” or POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is exclusively up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and competencies to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some in-house programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Tribute to the clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only Church of England clergyman to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a combatant was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the achievement that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage," led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was “very honored to participate in the parade” and added that “the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people.”
Mixed martial arts fans wake up all night to watch Bellator 206 watch instead Peppa Nut
Imagine this: you stay up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of Vedettas, and in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 matches, with six from the main group, and was being aired live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the clash, viewers in the UK were astonished when the cover shifted to Peppa Nut.
Some were not impressed after they had been awake until dawn especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad-tasting joke."
"Government regulations say the content isn't suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to another schedule," Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa nut, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said it will rectify the broadcast schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the repetition, I think we can solve the problem," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning there and we can’t figure it out until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We're trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It is a deplorable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' to His Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also claimed that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The show's longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
To this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real motive that has given me the power and strength to achieve success.
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and has used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "has taken me by surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though he said age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through so much when we're so young" - his first Olympics appearance was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar ups and downs.
The couple had a son last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "their whole outlook" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
"I was holding him out of hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games ... there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration for her first song choice - Proud, by Heather Small - with which she had identified herself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives her chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. British summer time.
Mickelson down in shape at Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Saturday, but he will have to regain his form to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record number of entries, was sent to the bank by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men's major championships has split the day between the role of supporter and the work on his game on the field, in the hope of rectifying what afflicts him.
The 48-year-old has never had the most straight shots, even at the height of his career, and is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where the rough long usually punishes the stray shots.
And if the pitch alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face precise British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point draw to start the 12 singles games, make a good start, Mickelson's departure could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could affirm much more.
"He totally understood the role I had today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't faced him playing two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never evened the successes of his individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and is an excellent person to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his big advantage could disappear in the blink of an eye.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that his loose lead on entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a bumpy ride.
The Dane had his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with his nose at the narrowest of the margins, beating by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 Tournament win 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead 10-5 at Le Golf National.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this isn’t over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This isn't over until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performances and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the fullest.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to abandon their partner and he has to go and give his best as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have earned three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these big upheavals on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle at Medinah" from its hat.
"I remember all the words," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you’d like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum is headed to one side, the pressure is very great in these middle starts.
We organized our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the first half of the ordering.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire route,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
German warship once again delayed
The latest German navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the command ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cited a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that the navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have meant that with state-of-the-art warships, seen as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a number of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the contingent needed on the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the navy’s ability to install additional functionality in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to be twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware flaws, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems plaguing the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
He said the problem has grown exponentially over time, as older ships have been put out of service without existing vessels to replace them.
In the end, he lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
Further investigations are underway on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared browns and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations throughout the property to track the bats’ activities throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland farming, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably over the past century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development work that affect dormitories and make habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a threat, along with fly papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, inspections of dormitories and sometimes rescues.
It has also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave estate at Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still a lot about bats that we don’t know, so the work we do here and on the other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance on the properties, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dorm could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are avenging.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” stating that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that she would then have paid $375 000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-ball winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy home and it’s okay,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where the player raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo got on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she addressed the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged assault. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing automakers
The UK would “repent forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We have to have an agreement, we want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the seizing by us of this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicates that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a highly successful supply chain set.”
Although it was not able to give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that in the long run the increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "postponed another week" as there is still no understanding as to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The fact that Trump may be preparing for the dismissal of the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been fuelling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the hypothesis of covertly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Justice Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not yet been set, it could be this week but it could also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with such a statement: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the “protagonism” of television reporters, although he said that he “would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism.”
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, adding, without adding any evidence: “We’ve analyzed these numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We tried to do that often and they saw that we did it in the last few weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences when receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service on Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s exit from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to fund applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Throughout the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationalities.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ said.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He approached the sideline and practically passed out,” Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie's oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV of Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet about the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, suspended studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five placards on Saturday before leaving the game, which brings his season total to 18 placards.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp tax on foreign buyers acquiring property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The increase in the stamp tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax rate will be levied on foreign buyers who purchase property in the UK, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to make more affordable housing available and tax higher incomes.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof to the homeless.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and lease purchases – could amount to three percent.
The finance ministry expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is acquired by non-residents in the UK, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding unused land, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve the "housing misfortune" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a so-called set of proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and the end of evictions "without justification".
It also wants to give the municipalities extended powers for the construction of new houses.
May said: “Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of owning their home has become too distant and the shame of sleeping in the open remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "ultimate ambition" is to become a Scottish coach.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of bringing new life to the northeastern club, currently third in the Premier League, three points ahead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after coaching St. Mirren on their return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if he succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he was not afraid to succeed such established names at such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success at the moment comes down to 'Can I get the club back into the Premier League?'
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, his place is undoubtedly in the Premier League."
“It will not be easy to get the club back, but I will only consider that I have been successful here when I reach that goal.”
Ross's coaching career is only three years old, following a stint as Dumbarton's assistant coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of dismissal to the title of champion the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of the stress and pressures of the job, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled British pubs but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Catering groups saw 2.7% growth in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup career has caused the June pattern, in which pubs recorded 2.8% growth in sales, to repeat itself in July, but restaurants have experienced a setback.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the beverage-based business had by far the best performance, with a peer growth that more than compensated for the descent of restaurants.
The pubs with the meal-based business also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s leisure and catering analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing the sales of the food market away from home.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for operators with the business based on meals. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the industry-wide indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hides secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, a study found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of "fake" pages on Instagram
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing website.
The news aggravates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had an innocuous "main" account to show their parents, while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenage girl was inciting others to “rape” her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors’ Conference (HMC), found that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice of athletes’ at Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most medal-winning Scottish athletics practitioner. President Ian Beattie has described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of her vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have much to gain from its presence on the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be able to act as the voice of athletes and hope to be able to truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It’s been a month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk anymore.
The doctors said only time would tell if and to what extent he could recover.
It has been a hard job but I have achieved a total recovery, I have relearned walking and I even do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows in milking.
To mark the launch of what is described as the “first portable silent milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic announcement inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom the new pump gives milk pumping mothers.
Four mothers dance on a hay-filled vacation to the sound of a song that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, I don't have tits, these are my tits."
The chorus goes on: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my girls."
However, the announcement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it lightens the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented, “Comprehensiblely traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone said, "An advertisement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "joking."
"I think the idea is brilliant.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but it makes sense.
This product is genius,” wrote one of the women.
Another commented, “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who draw milk (often in the bathroom or workplace) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who pump milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave the house while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the women who extract milk and the dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way that people can identify with the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new pump.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the walkway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Discreetly Displaced to a Texas Border Camp
The number of detained migrant children has peaked despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most of the “parents” are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who integrate their households would have to register their fingerprints, with the data shared with immigration regulators.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the godparents or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
Seeking to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to reception center officials.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their request for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to attacks of violence or attempts to escape, according to reception center officials and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large size contributes to children’s signs of disruption being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends worsens the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces'
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they “will be treated as such.”
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any and all illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions for his return were assured, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that led the refugees to remain abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-associated Al-Nusra Front fighters, who "will be eradicated".
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, setting the stage for elections.
Moualem established conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that the panel’s work should be limited to “revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end his presidency early.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of tiredness from spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable's audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is a strong decoy for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He once called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington may determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion for immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s about more than being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate about Bob Woodward’s use of “deep knowledge” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather coat (“a piece of clothing full of insolence,” as the Washington Post referred to it) and the implications of the descriptions...
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s been doing looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists of the storyline.
We can't miss an episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, watching MSNBC as he was recording CNN.
Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Justice Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but they were right.”

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th circle of Pennsylvania is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of constituencies that left two starters in the race for the same place.
The recent readjustment of Pittsburgh’s suburban circles has put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th circle sparked a fierce feud over campaign funding between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary election for the 18th constituency of the Pennsylvania Congress.
That place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. consider penalizing El Salvador for backing China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until the partners ejected the Trump Organization from leadership.
State Department officials have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With internal meetings continuing, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to move forward, putting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about internal deliberations under cover of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be dropped could be legal counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is substantial evidence currently in the public domain.
Mueller is reportedly targeting his investigation to determine whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to run again to voters and perhaps be judged by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – or that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup, provided that the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating about his inability to hold the office.
Rosenstein says the news from The Times is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she told me to light Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how could I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of game with Vienna Rapid
The Rangers host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians in the wake of Spain's impressive draw with Villarreal earlier this month will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until a two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We looked at the game with a positive mindset and we got a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end but overall, the tie was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we turned around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very hard, with all my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the practice runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past season and achieve success."
Women Are Losing Sleep With Fear Of This Savings-Retirement Account
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of the type of care they intended to receive, few people spoke to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continuing care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make their wishes known in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have these amounts available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney, choosing a person you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Also consider setting up a power of attorney on your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become disabled.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suffering a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Do you know how to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” Martin asked.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a pressure of air when returning home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and the police have sought witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a heavy earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications disrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region stretching over 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific seismic ring of fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation wrought by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was detained on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held pre-trial at Mat-Su pre-trial detention center on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, meaning he could be sentenced to up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of guns under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations for associating her child’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the Central Sulawesi region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutor asks for rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor's Office is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bicycle path on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries, according to the death penalty notice, recorded in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder in the service of organized crime, typically used by the Public Prosecutor's Office in organized crime cases, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “considerable planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the South Zone of New York has not asked for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court’s documentation, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
It also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to “mobilize the people’s army” during a protest at the Conservatives’ congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have “already left” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists has been underscored by conservatives advocating permanence, who have organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to keep up her plan of compromise, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, proponents of permanence and the EU.
The allies insist that it will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan."
Bone suggested that responsibility should have been assigned to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were responsible, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he declared: “We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to stay is utterly misguided.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve of it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Only prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians must “feel pressure” if they are ready to betray the decision out of the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the people’s army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK.”
Meanwhile, proponents of permanence marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A crowd of activists held banners with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour’s representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for ‘Canada More’, for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Possible Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider the presidential candidacy” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-leader of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman in the top place.”
Detention in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help in identifying a man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the campus of Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, which resulted in his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was a 10-time starter last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Coming out of pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind by defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pits and made Hamilton have to face the end of the platoon traffic, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the pits one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a rough skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came out of the last row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tires very late, which would allow him to be quick in the final part, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the pits in lap 44 but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
Bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she would not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, commenting instead that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious and false.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious and fake people are,” Trump said.
“When we see the information leaks and the communiqués and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape come from you?
Do you remember her response, did you disclose the document?
Oh, no, no.
The escape did not come from me.”
Well, wait a minute.
The escape came from us... No, it wasn’t us,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had come from his office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not reveal her story,” Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "You know what else, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see the evil, the malice, it doesn't matter who they can hit, who they have to step on to take power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two Giants goals against Dundee
The Dundee Stars redeemed themselves from a loss on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second leg 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got an initial two-goal lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had managed a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2–1.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the draw to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants to reach the first break in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a potent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers flee earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after his death by ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to ravage the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post as the control tower rocked violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower, in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of deaths could reach thousands, citing the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
“Minimarkets are being pillaged everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces there and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Airplane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a man missing after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical condition.
It is not yet known for certain what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and loved the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
“It was the best thing that happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had managed to drag themselves with the water by the waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He said the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors working on a nearby dock upgrade also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by claiming that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis’s testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers's death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
“You erased it from your life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin making its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscientious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to these roots and restore popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent rebirth in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York maid sues couple for dismissal via 'racist' text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received a text message from her mother complaining that "it was another black woman."
The couple denied the allegations of racism, saying the lawsuit was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she discovered that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
“I CAN’T BELIEVE... MORE THAN A BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she realized her gaffe, an “embarrassed” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice on the grounds of the poor performance of the previous African-American nanny who was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day job and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and asking for $350/day redundancy compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
"I want to show them that they cannot go unpunished," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination."
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared not being able to trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him something that I didn’t really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you entrust your children to someone who had treated them badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I can't believe it."
Calling the process “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
While the legal process proceeds, the court of public opinion was quick to condemn the couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: “It’s hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to get to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful.”
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little play bear to write the children's book, would not have taken it to heart if the book had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who described him as “a very important member of our family,” he said his father was very proud of the success he had achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to bragging,” he said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a successful son: we get proud even when it’s not our accomplishment.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the fruit of his imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone.
Shortly after landing, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
All together.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep the heart working were slowly stopping working and leaving his system.
He had died a while ago and all of his organs were stopping.
I had to stand there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to restrain myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers to the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
“I always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt enormous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning attach cards to bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a Lydney resident, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it would light up the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had “dipped into darkness.”
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always worried about a possible repercussion.”
Sharon Davis created the postcards "to let them know that there are people who are available to help and with whom they can talk, even if it is a friend.
Don't shut yourself up, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, very soon after her mother-in-law’s death.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Smash a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI investigation begins
"I thought that by having the resemblance to what I had asked for -- an investigation with defined time and scope -- we could be more united," Flake said on Saturday, saying he feared the commission was "collapsing" in the face of a deep-seated party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is a merely temporal matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate for the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh will be able to win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tiebreaker vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Defectors Decreases During Kim Regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since the rise to power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as smugglers asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
As a rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean defectors.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flees through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants and not refugees, and it is common to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at a standstill.
The talks followed the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to collaborate on the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the House, said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all legations of sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made an emotional opening statement, sometimes in a shrill and sobbing voice, when talking about his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the commission’s Democrats, dubbing the allegations made against him of “a grotesque, conspiracy-driven assassination” by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton of losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh’s testimony proves he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court given his prejudiced behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would attempt to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t qualify to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the D.C. District Court of Relations.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she feared potential Kavanaugh’s views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given her reputation as a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the possibility of revoking certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and hope that we will be happy with the decision,” Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and it cannot vent without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position at some company helped me a lot. She told me she was crying when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and she started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a man-dominated office where I cried with inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman -- an unfriendly manager who terrified me a little -- and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy that they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic Congresswoman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on her presidential bid.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and quit his candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder saw no reason why she could not run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraising was far short of desirable and he vowed that he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
“Do you think I’m entitled to a discount?” he asked.
When she announced that she would not enter a formal campaign, emotions came to the top – gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and bringing the message to voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism – and tears emerged.
“It even looked like she was depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write on my epitaph now?
"She cried"?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China may be beneficial for Beijing
The first salvage of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the withdrawal of the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with the new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the US.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 percent to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to falter in the near future.
Getting Washington back would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the US could positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to the study of Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for return of refugees
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of the refugees and calls for help in the reconstruction of a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European National Team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive losses on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during most of the tournament, threw the starting tee into the water at hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England’s Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It's been a tough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the American golf legend, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
“It’s impossible to describe how proud I am to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup record.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-caliber performance throughout the tournament, the remaining U.S. national team members struggled to get to the fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
We fought.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and I will collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
I have to take my hat off the other team.
