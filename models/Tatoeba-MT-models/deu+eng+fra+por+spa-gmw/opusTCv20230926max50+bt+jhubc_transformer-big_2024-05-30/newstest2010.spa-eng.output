Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and check of $1.4 million will be received, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected you between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive him, though the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he did not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and cheque of 10 million Swedish kroner (approximately 24 million Czech kroner).
It is proposed to donate them for charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During their full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude toward the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not deserve it altogether.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".

Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the southern Moravian villages can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the city councils are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in separating waste, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw in the center a PET bottle in the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
That Mr. Onderka and his comrades are not angry with me, but that seems to me too little.
It goes without saying that elsewhere it is also not easy to separate the garbage.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By vagancy
The containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the socialists in Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the extra league of hockey, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole region Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
The budget of "Paroubek" took money from income and sickness subsidies
After the left, in spite of the government’s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government to later ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That means just postponing the problems for the future, it means laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay back the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social benefits or operating expenses of the State, it must increase taxes.
To everyone he added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later on, his children too.
People don't have to worry about rents or sickness allowances, they will receive them. Of these accounts 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the increase of the public debt; next year will not be lacking in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year it will also take five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most that can be done is to keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a salomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the State, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless sack.
Last year <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated $18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividends are settled ecological damages, serve to complete the account for income or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of income.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit is increased to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly $3 billion was raised from the budget to provide various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, take advantage of the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also still missing for the Statn<0xC3><0xAD> pokladna (State Box) project, which is priced at two billion and has already been initiated. It must allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between various operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
At the touch of a button, they move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be released in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware is cooperating with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only ski lift operators in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e care about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD>, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are still free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute holiday stays,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer open spaces.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is affected by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year on the mountain without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be exhausted as well," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well,” said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of the New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied also at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the manager of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will pass the desire for snow waiting.
Temperatures should fall on Thursday and, if there is precipitation, it should snow in the mountains.
But then the temperatures will rise again, reported Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It’s funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats on the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the most foolish.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase “the same as in Iraq” used several times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for his own statement: “A New Way Forward.”
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing is said about Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor in a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially Commander-in-Chief of Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but didn’t come up with anything better, so at least he cheated on the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is met.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “actionable,” a minimum goal of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now on the verge of erupting.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "come home soon" will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the Hindu Kush war.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the U.S. will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if it proves to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will not receive cash bonuses again
Top executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it must take, said former JPMorgan investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion (almost CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses at the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax bank bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000) one-time, with a 50 percent tax.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except physics.
Five women, which is a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialized categories and literature from King Charles XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, one of the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as fellow countryman Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and American Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was awarded to the American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each recipient collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kroner (approximately 25 million Czech kroner).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will meet Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of Representatives.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, is supposed to be the topics of her meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
On the appointment, spokesperson for President Radim Ochvat said.
Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved proposals from the left for transfers of funds and increased money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
There was a serious internal political conflict between the left and the government, Klaus and the right, and the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, which was agreed in the spring by the SDG, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Representatives, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem", that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted, calling similar words “strong judgments.”
The head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government.
On Wednesday, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say that the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama about the boxing world Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slave-abolition movement, the fictional president of the United States, and even God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, to many people, Man is as important as he is.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his efforts to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong globally to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela’s story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I found that by squeezing your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look a lot higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the actors’ characters and their actual models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and is also talked about ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near its border with Norway.
The "Bulava" missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight, there were again technical problems with the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That's why it's likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The same Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals defend themselves this time by claiming that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines immediately broke down in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent filled with optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Bulavá" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and will likely play in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve a few formal issues, the AP quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear if the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the longest-running professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all supplementary work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman of the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, so we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will be worked in two shifts, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who work the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the extra work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, prolonging the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and signed the document, they would be willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the auto factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent overtime work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
Management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of emergency by strike on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who last Wednesday interrupted the manufacturing, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, the trade unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production began last November.
As of last September, it has manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in the 'Rashed' HIV Viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is effective also against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs are already accessible.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and Heidelberg University demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all the drugs used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metallocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, fractionation of the HIV virus does not occur and mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would not be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteasis was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, but they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, the head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Genetic Science.
Fight for the budget. SDG attacked Fischer, he defends
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the approved budget for next year is "horrifying" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, he said, think about its future existence.
The SDGs statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to rely on the minority, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The House of Representatives yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendment proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
SDGs before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and Uselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of the disappointment and the feeling of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were approved, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he’s thinking about staying in the role.
The reason is his disillusionment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, whether the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that relate to sickness subsidies, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: SDG-nominated ministers are not to blame
It is the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The SDG-nominated ministers have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people belonging to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it leans on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, it will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will deal with it, said Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDGs.
Prime Minister Fischer went out in the afternoon to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
SDGs ceded at Prime Minister's request
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that SDGs in the House of Representatives on Wednesday would likely vote against the amended budget if the prime minister did not explicitly ask SDGs to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, reacted to the question, if SDG does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the following months it would be mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>D’s new train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule takes effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dráhy for this line will add a pendolin road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not run again to Bratislava.
On the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice there will be fewer fast trains, the direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest planned reduction in transport by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line and some fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will also be cancelled.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run every two hours.
From December 13th, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year’s regional rail account: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the fast and local trains drahy have a new contract of ten years, until now the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur on day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 crowns for trips between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Still Arresting More Than 50 People, Children Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including a number of elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which previously reported only about 65 abductees.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the southern province of Agusan.
It is said that approximately 19 gunmen use the hostages as a live shield in the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the gunmen belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor’s election were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
On Tuesday, however, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA’s Story Refers to Everyone, Says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>) will be released in American cinemas, capturing a portion of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the lead role by Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere, they are born from the reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
It comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world championship in football culminate in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film at RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the starring roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - recharge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the holiday premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember the character and message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team suit
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field. RSA won the World Cup at the time.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans are skeptical, however, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in an interview for LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns burns
The fire grabbed a transformer from the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company in a switch box near the village V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company’s spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, enumerating it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokesperson of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company for northern Czechia, the electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire of the electric substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or companies.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps p<0xC5><0xAF>sob<0xC3><0xAD> in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electrical conduction of 4,339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a libel complaint to three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Hetmans
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a libel complaint against three Social Democratic Hetmans.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and the Hetman from Olomouck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talk about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the company Student Agency, he said for Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
He mentioned at the same time having the evidence of all the regions. According to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I call on the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, again on this occasion, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He clarified that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commission of about 150 billion crowns they did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD deputy, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, that if we don't leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which man it is about, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said today for Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The pneumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on August 2nd of last year will be able to receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1,600 crowns and more.
In order to vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally, experts estimate that insurance companies will spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner on vaccines annually.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent about 500,000 dollars on all vaccination of children annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
Of the pneumococcal infections in our country each year die according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccine may be compulsory in the future.
As of January, it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At the moment we do not think at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary Vaccine Has Its Disadvantages, Doctors Say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost praktick<0xC3><0xBD>ch d<0xC4><0x9B>tsk<0xC3><0xBD>ch léka<0xC5><0x99><0xC5><0xAF> Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation where the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The pneumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could “get the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a notable sum.
It won’t be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in the theft of a museum
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his portrayals of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
The Labour Party defends the tax increases in the budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PREVIOUS REPORT TO THE BUDGET
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy to contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
The 1-point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax relief for electric cars and wind turbines
State pensions would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and who wins <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved “hard decisions,” but insisted that 60% of the extra tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Treasury Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a “sandkorn in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers, it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be reduced, have been called into question after the Finance Minister was forced to change the initial figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April, while the loan order would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
“Opportunity wasted”
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" dodging difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
“All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals that would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandcastles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the rise in inflation from some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the finance minister exposed to allegations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour party insists that it is being provided to the people most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that adjustments to public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Finance Minister’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really deferring the pain to later,” director Robert Chote said.
“All important announcements will come after the election, whoever wins,” added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This has been the fake pre-budget report. Markets are realizing this."
FBI Investigates 'Detention of Americans in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
Pakistan's U.S. embassy told the BBC the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been arrested and under what kind of circumstances they are being held,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,” she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
He said the house was already in the sights of local police and no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian 'abuses'
Human rights in Iran for the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime’s “models of abuse” before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, in my head... They threatened to execute me and they humiliated me."
Amnesty said after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who said he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the post-selection discomfort and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confusing and the parliamentary committee’s inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a racing track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, in front of a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You can see below a beautiful view of the city lights flickering.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent.”
Awards were given for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread warning about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab-born Muslim scholar and scholar.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They fail to fully disseminate this argument.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism may be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are truly committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “an adjustment of values.”
After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can’t survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who proved their worth in confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult's range. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear resident in Singapore has turned green by the algae growing inside the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Eskimo Indians in snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a mind-boggling look at how the future of the Arctic can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not for lack of effort.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Submarines from the Cold War then mapped out the moving ice cords circulating beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resilient individuals camping in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of saline water that is compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once summer ice retreats, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington tombs
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans’ graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don’t get as many visitors as the new tombs, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, as they carried the fresh pine to the gravestones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"A long time after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban Officials Arrested U.S. Government Contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including minor protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but has been denied permission.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor could likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of Friday night's arrest.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for texting, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as handing out free mobiles in Cuba, is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the organization Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the placement of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro as the country's leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason, they were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not immutable and were even trying to get proper approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determines who they trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting in those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al-Qaeda is looking at aspiring American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about admitting, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate 'action'
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here demanding that negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center take bolder action for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
In a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish that declared, "The Earth says "enough is enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said the trips to Peru, her mother’s homeland, made me aware of the distressing issues the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified because he was involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black attire placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they began as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like China’s chief climate negotiator, Su Wei.
Asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I was really not aware of the situation.”
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "Since the meeting place is great, I cannot hear what is going on outside."
He pointed out that it depended on the perspective of each defining whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test Data Reveal Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s federal gradebook on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the gradebook showed fourth- and eighth-grade pupils jumped at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. white fourth graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance gap grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-degree African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the targets were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not quite large.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no longer encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was unveiled in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the gap has narrowed to just 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the ensemble by catering to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit advocacy organization for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-Per Accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton Elementary.
Brown, an assiduous critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries us is that we are not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high and middle school students, who have not mastered the fundamentals of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday math, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizing real-life games and experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system while still providing additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a sort of rugged dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the objective can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
We have to get to almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers’ union last year in an 185-day year, which she considers as an “indicator” to seek a greater increase in the next agreement.
Making Higher Education a Part of More Futures
The tour bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 12 years old, descended and blinked for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic prospective students.
This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Damn, seriously?, he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the low teacher-student ratio of the school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question isn’t whether you’re going to go to college.
The question is which.
While there are growing concerns about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who access college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those looking at the top performers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away by bidding on only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached deals for auctioned fields in June.
The poor representation of US oil giants in opening up Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world's third-largest oil reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and secured large investments in contracts for two major oil fields.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will keep pace with its competitors and deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made bids that were then confronted with the per-barrel subsidy the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda's top planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified, CIA-operated plane inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal area.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official with Pakistan’s civil intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner for al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiring around the world, a senior official said, speaking anonymously, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
It had a strategic guide from the top command of al Qaeda and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly ascended into the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al-Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned jet attacks has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count in The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit organization.
The decline is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
UN chief envoy in Kabul about to resign
U.N. envoy Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hurt by accusations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timeline for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who are cooperating with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better for them to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month void between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to U.N. officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "certainly hurt the mission, because there was already much skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate aid efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, which lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration over the constraints on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
Such is that UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran for its failure to enter into talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that, if we have learned anything about Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He said it would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would really be less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully comply with the guidance of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would re-negotiate on the restriction of his nuclear program and would agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such a deal, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have drifted away from tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran’s tightening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way they have not been in terms of meaningful additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded and baseless accusations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it has a willingness to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. plans, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction, US officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of Kurdistan’s regional government: “We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching to them that “Mother Earth is too tired to support more children” and “one more baby means one more grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: by no means.
We have already given all our time and energy to only one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously chubby children, rude one-children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
Demographics of the UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Family Planning and Population Commission, said fertile couples must have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labour shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing’s Institute for Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the evening, posters ordering families to have a single child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
She has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to reach only about 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Municipality family planning committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want more children.
They want to give their best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally entitled to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance that the government provides them.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants an only child because she too was: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For parents with two middle-class careers who reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents fight during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from the parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best nurseries when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging positions and mutual recrimination, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on them in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that policy strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de Bóer described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the talks last week.
The U.S. special climate envoy, Todd Stern, rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not financed by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for having said earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, the lines of failure have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s 24 most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that major powers are arguing over who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive looking to contain the big issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change said they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the talks will at most yield a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drafted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before heads of government come to a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister, stepped off the planes and rushed into the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate the claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The utter disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center every day, activists who play the guitar present evening shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, vice president for global conservation policy International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first train at 225 km/h redefines Monday’s sentiment
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected secluded areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the switch from planes and cars to rail would reduce national coal emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still slow Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the Western Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” said one railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains of 400 mt in length, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the space constraints of the capital, an existing station is expected to be extended to suit the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston Station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on the existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange Tree from a Conservative
Conservative Party spokesman Alan Duncan charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency house.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “from rations,” raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the extra interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
Authorities in the House of Commons approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have sold for nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal."
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent House Standards and Privileges Committee investigation into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London property to the house of his constituency, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in mortgage interest, through March of last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire raise would finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The BRE’s standard variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as House opposition chairman in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "rations" after the spending scandal.
“Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit.”
He stated, “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound symbol in Mr. Duncan’s lawn as a protest, after revealing that he requested <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved both by the wage office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about evading and criminalizing or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could in no way be clearer or simpler.”
Come on, those who have faith, to see the calendar of the advent of Brighton Beach palapa
The Brighton palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could watch the last palapa from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm every day, with stuffed cakes and punch served free of charge.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I believe the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to test and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday calling for an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming, both around the world and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital in demand for an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Conference on Climate Change by Friday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night, handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set for the invited speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the climate.”
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo said.
In Africa, there are rivers that are drying out, watercourses through which you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were hundreds of protesters who demanded to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, though Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another separatist Georgian region recognized by Russia.
Election tables closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to officials of the Electoral Commission of Abkhazia, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on the evening of Saturday to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of ballot scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under full Russian occupation,” said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a pretty white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and most particularly, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that his country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that ceded to Russia control of the Abkhazian railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left the Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set for the invited speakers, and the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the floor.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We didn’t take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with celestial raincoats, responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the climate.”
Today we took to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalization figure, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
Oxfam along with former U.N. refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, concentrations of hundreds of protesters were formed calling for action against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography comes reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday Newspaper (JDD, according to his French acronym) that history and geography would come "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all first-grade students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to stress even: "Neither did I hear that historians or intellectuals were indignant about having eliminated history and geography second to high school in technology schools."
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L’Humanité revealed that about seven French out of ten (69 percent) disapproved of the government’s project to eliminate compulsory history-geography second-grade teaching from high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that “there is no talk” of eliminating philosophy from the second-grade C baccalaureate program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
In addition, they will do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you do all the practices proposed before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to eliminate the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the “Ernest” conference wheel, a day consisting of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We selected about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, “we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public would understand that “the Copenhagen conference is based on a highly serious scientific record.”
The videos filmed during those lectures will be online on the school’s website starting December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is planned for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delay in payments: Disgust among prison guards, plans to take action
Prison guard unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers’ Force (2nd Guards Union) asked the off-duty staff to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “lock them” to denounce the theft of their assets.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", since it calls it "shameful and unacceptable" the non-compliance with payment in December of the "overtime hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were counted, but they say the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Foreign Ministry reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for the management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who "always blame the budgetary demands," lamented the Ufap / Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said indignantly the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, threatens also FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing the tasks and missions without taking more effective, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not as expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Makes ‘Better Gifts’ Than He Receives
President Barack Obama, who is celebrating his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to famous television host Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: “I make better gifts than I receive.”
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the New Year’s Eve holidays in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s small four-legged companion, will be from the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,” she said, provoking the president.
It is true, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered his favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the president said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his loved ones, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again late Wednesday-Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked for "injuries arising from the herniated disc surgery" performed in Paris on Nov. 26, his press service in the same city said, indicating that such injuries "needed a reparative operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey reassurance by claiming that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical party would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said he was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
“He called me just before I went to Los Angeles, and I told him it was silly to fly twelve hours after such an operation, it’s not possible,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure him that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been over-reported, with fans and journalists noticing the musician’s difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medallist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance he feels particular affection for, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were last allowed, only three world records were surpassed when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a mark he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that from January 1 will be banned.
These swimsuits, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the same test for the first time in 1999.
This time the use of swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower his 400m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he won with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give myself up thoroughly in this race.
I knew this time I wasn’t going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A panel of sarcophagus that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A panel of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This 2 meter long by 63 cm high panel dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated at between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and drunken women, is a rare piece, as in the world there are only four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, without a doubt, told AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition by Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Paris mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about 50 years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure from Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the safe-conduct.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take it to Zelaya has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
To grant him a safe-conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The coup government "suffered another defeat by asking me to resign from my office ... they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has been making statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar,” added the deposed president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing chords.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing an asylum application, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal character of this government against international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must be held accountable to justice for the crime of “high treason,” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by countries of Latin America, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness of the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67 percent; and the Nasdaq, 0.33 percent.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68,78 points to reach 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technology component, 7.13 points to reach 2,191.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big novelty is the growth in trade volumes, particularly goods exports, reflecting the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of the government of Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
Let the Yankees die!, “Mercenaries!”, “The street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Long live Fidel and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l!”, the militants of power fist-up at the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect" them.
The day before, a similar demonstration broke out against the “Ladies in White” in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were arrested by police officers dressed as civilians, an AFP journalist reported.
Agents forcibly pushed the vehicles to dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to the reporter.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "apply for the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" for the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration by government militants against the “counter-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts du Seine) on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly hit an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of the boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses reported.
In the wake of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to an official of the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with his partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stood in and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently by chance, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives crossed on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance union in the Hautes du Seine.
Several bystanders, including young people, tried to control the alienated, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn’t do it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd was thrown at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor, and when I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in his abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of being held in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "every disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks for dismissal of case
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West USA) again called for the case to be dismissed against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, over a sexual abuse case that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," denounced before three judges of the Second District of California Appeals Chamber serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges are dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) had a conversation with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison before handing down his sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally, Wells declared in late September that he had "lyed" the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed that a trial would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument set out in the first instance, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for "illegal sex" with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor to the court, even though he despises its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client can no longer stand harassment every time the Polanski case reappears, adding: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
“Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses track and slows down by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday aimlessly, in a market that is struggling between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technology component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and smaller, and I think it will stay that way until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic revival,” the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded visibly in December, 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were held back by a new upturn in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "brings downwards to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, the technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are on the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row around Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real commotion.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw a lot of things and I lived countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
This contest, which is being held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 pm (15 pm GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have been alive twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "breath-taking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the candidates for Miss World focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both converted to Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown,” declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, swimsuits.
Chinese host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World event.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous Soweto township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably returning for the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News about Johnny Hallyday is 'very positive', says son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from the herniated disc operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The musician has been "in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, a sequel to a herniated disc operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated twice on a herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before, on the RTL station, he said that apparently the singer had left "without cannula, with nothing" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg also intervened to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, DLR) as planned, I find it very risky, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardista party, urging him to withdraw it from all support, otherwise be sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, as he considers that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, it received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, since it was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy by instructing them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the brand, under penalty of a lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to regain the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement’s name, the Nouveau Centre+, and the slogan “L’UDF d’aujourd’hui+” in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the letter’s signatories argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from any support, as well as from (its) website."
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate beneficiaries."
Failure to do so will appeal to justice to uphold the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they state that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Center has no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the mark", he was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It makes scandalous and fraudulent use of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC’s strategy: “We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to leave anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you do not have the right.”
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to put artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to strip her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and 375,000 euros in fine.
This means that in this case there will be a saga-worthy process about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010 stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weaknesses and during which periods.
I think he'll take it.
"I'm going to talk to her," Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as she left the hearing.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expert report will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been suing multifaceted photographer and artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier for years, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother’s weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the merits of the lawsuit brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings turned out, on some occasions, to be a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she was suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In her 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, “I could explain to my daughter that I wrote Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office once again held that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give rise to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No one else will be allowed to appear in their place,” said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, the public prosecutor’s representative.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule upon the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
The Management Revolution or the End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as it used to be about imposing on consumers products designed by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more so, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) “requires that all parties involved ... have proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision”; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative usefulness
Will internal opinion polls, such as the Orange questionnaire among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the ancient behaviorist theory that the American “neurosciences” recently revived, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent research of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a position of mechanistic management, unsuited to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motif-Functional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "on-the-spot".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: Obama receives praise from the right for 'just war'
On Friday, the U.S. right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of a “fair war” against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama’s speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s Oct. 9 award, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Ms. Palin, a leading figure in the right wing of the Republican Party, told USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo devoted himself to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech went really well, the former Speaker of the House rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of “the existence of evil in the world” in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a possible Republican investiture candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear from “a left-wing president” when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and could not deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world", as he "always does", he "spoke as an American president" by reminding Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonic, pretentious and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech a “superproduction” especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times estimated, judging it “at the same time as bleak and uplifting.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, trade unions in the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that ends the strike slogan and the threat posed to Christmas supplies.
During Friday night's signing session, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau was "joyed" by the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hopes of quickly signing the text accordingly late in the morning.
Even though three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew with a door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees a 4 per cent increase for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and a 2.9 per cent increase for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give orders to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgruntled rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro drop in employers' burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 draft rectification finance law, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “on the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies that are members of this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a "business of naives", since the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to counter those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, lamented the Unostra.
For OTRE, the agreement puts “the stability of many SMEs in the sector at risk over the next 12 months”.
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, unions disagree with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts on the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the second day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important holiday shopping weekend, Saturday and Sunday will only run trains between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train every two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train every four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that “RATP strives to serve large stores.”
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains circulated in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le de France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had woken up "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on schedule".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general meetings of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The Director of the ERNs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the ERN A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want who claim a premium that’s owed them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company “didn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which until then refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents have filed a notice.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, A Decision With Serious Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked outrage in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just lent a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the “focus of activities that undermine the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, were removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before becoming parliamentarians without party labels.
The decision comes following a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007 that accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to label it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government reaches out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order's forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters dropped Molotov bombs or stones with slingshots.
Approximately 100 people were also concentrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen discouragement.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This is not the solution, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
The snow can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It’s not at all something you want to make life impossible for citizens, says FES’s winter road maintenance director
But with it, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists may be announcing it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-tracks leave with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts at around three in the morning, "with this the tracks are free until the rush hour traffic begins".
The hard part is when it starts to snow around 7:30 am.
“Then we have a problem,” says the road maintenance manager in winter, “because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side streets.
That’s where the inconvenience is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly the dangerous points and cruises are cleared.
Generally, the FES would not be able to take over all of the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salted vehicle gets started as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa findae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-high animal that ran on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa findae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we’ve found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
Finding Confirms Theories About Ancient Dinosaur History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not fully share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for example.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the older fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are found the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as "long-necked" sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivorous Stevishauia.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa findae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa's skull, researchers found signs of air bags, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to air bags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the case of Tawa finds also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurians first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangaea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa found the remains of two other theropods not closely related.
The three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in modern-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs succeeded in evolving from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to Mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of modern crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the boundary of the Triassic towards the Jurassic.
Successful stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
A massive extinction could have occurred that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteor impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the busy Frankfurt Goethe University casino reverberated around the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students protesting on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike evicted last week because the walls and works of art were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police commando".
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served for “the delegitimization and criminalization of protest” and diverted attention from content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hesse, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to the vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of studying students’ arguments and demands thoroughly, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow's ten districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Protocol of Close Collaboration" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortium and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities were settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not placed high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were considered at the time 19th century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since in the past it took an enormous amount of time to hook the locomotives back and forth.
Rolling, stopping dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a stopover station, which is approximately halfway between the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course also have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the newly built stretch of ICE to Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passage station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At the time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossroads and narrow passages on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-paced route has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the verdict on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Wiesbaden Autonomous Parliament, if it will file an appeal to the ruling on the ban on night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page VGH ruling, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had argued in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4 if it will file an appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to relinquish the appeal to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of a night air traffic ban, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's recrimination, which the federal government would be attempting through misrepresentations of the law and tricks still obtaining its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a bit of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally flawless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group's claims about a night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks are paying back the aid they have been lent.
The big American banks shaken by the crisis are stripping themselves of their state ties.
The "Bank of America" returned all the aid provided by the Tarp bank bailout fund of a total of 45 billion euros (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return the state aid, according to a report by the U.S. CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had made approximately 19 billion net money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers Wednesday night especially: The financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank’s absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money in the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from well-known circles that the U.S. bank could announce an increase of its capital by $20 billion by Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned their aides.
Quick Election
In the end, everything went faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF’s board of directors pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night the guild wanted to vote on the candidate.
Favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the station, officially to not anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm ZDF director Markus Schächter any more, if this proposal would not be approved in the administrative board either.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the guild’s 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term of office from the prestigious editor with the argument that under Brender’s direction the ZDF news reports would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which it flogged political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 specialists in public law had even meddled in the debate, calling Koch's proceedings unconstitutional.
But it didn't do anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked for the station "Südwestfunk" and the daily "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the informative "today-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and director of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the removal of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazin" on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent in the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF's state convention in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of politicians supporters of the ZDF control guilds was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for Brender's removal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote, without falling under suspicion of giving the post to a supporter henchman.
In the calculations of the Frey parties he is attributed anyway to the left liberals.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally gave in. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to surpass their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically every module of the race must end with a single exam.
In addition, the aim is to examine the workload of students, and to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making structural rules more flexibly together for Bachelor’s and Master’s careers.
Regulations of the federated states that deviate from this should no longer exist.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the Rectors of the universities continuously talk about the improvement of being able to successfully complete a career (studyability).
Now, for the first time, there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam," it says in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
"Sensitive reduction of the examination burden" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be examined thoroughly as to unnecessary restrictions on students’ choice of ..
the courses.
Students would have “the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and encourage self-initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in examining existing races.
These must be "reaccredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the federated states.
Education and culture ministers urged federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far, only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured additional means for the further development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement tutoring and student counseling programs, as well as strengthen examination offices and abroad.
The federal state and universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should suffice for the completion of a career model.
The career configuration should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
By the end of next year, we intend to examine all races about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
In the board of directors at the federal level of the university groups Juso (young socialists) demanded, that the configuration of the education policy should no longer be carried out " behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now the students as majors involved should be able to comment as well.
The chairwoman of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for each student with the degree of Bachelor the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future enough places to study for Master with the best possible study conditions, as reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire quite a few more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is done virtually uncontrollably" says the first line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which it themes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked initially as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest, and later as a reader in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary prizes, in 1993 he taught memorable poetry lectures or lectures in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave enough talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Attempts to recruit had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"Therefore I am someone who has not sufficiently defended himself against Securitate's attempts to provoke fear," Söllner said.
Lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary polemic with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that highlights the abyss and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know so far, not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM file Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him on all difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller wrote in the July weekly "Zeit" after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and in some cases will have known what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the control files by the Securitate is still quite fuzzy.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather crawled.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke contemptuously of the decorated.
“She has psychosis,” she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes us hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team’s supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class cab a quarter of an hour after midnight, it seemed as if an elegantly dressed outside service member was leaving a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man with the characteristic bald had hired a chauffeur, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk with joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or I would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we have reached the eighth final", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we can not let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sweepstakes
The Champions League round of 16 finals (starts 16/17 and 23/24 February/returns 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminating entrance of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the so-called savior, who in a short time had inspired the bewildered Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, willingness to give themselves up and a taste for play.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more pitched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe of success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, accepted that "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had obviously been missing when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs constancy above all.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relays and totally overtaken by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira suggested.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which goalkeeper Jens Lehmann had granted.
There are decisions that others, and not Jens, faced Heldt's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
The latter had reproached weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change coaches under pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off had been eliminated after the games, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's remarks were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt said, announcing consequences for the defender.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two forties.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the team of the replaced coach, the show of great play and battle strength would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and also agreed with the man in the plastic suitcase.
World Heavyweight Championship Battle
Burning duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnsonn has been provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures over and over again.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version beat U.S. Kevin Johnson on Friday night in Bern by unanimous point decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be done.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven inches lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the blows of the world champion again and again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
At the weighing, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a pause of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to hand over without a fight.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only received one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, had explained Klitschko his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring all four major titles into his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
The previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar, because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has reproached Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly deceiving.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly did not tell the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of NATO’s report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it had been revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately speak out before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the foreign ministry, army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and her Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The Foreign Ministry had no influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been raised about the Ministry’s presentation on the grounds for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the background of the two high-ranking officials it transcended that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert reportedly asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung.
So far he has not received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday about the reproaches made to it, and said this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament’s commission of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dreaming worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, whoever experiences sleep-like states during waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world a madman or a drug addict, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dream-modified alert states of consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, shamanic possession states, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived of hallucinations as a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the ill-intentionedness, mad formations, and spurs".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with blood-red grins, deformed, gnashing their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy and flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Squeaky, malignant voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, binds them to form a hanging knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope loosens.
What a lesson to you!, shout the voices in a choir that bursts his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and have you healed!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected are no longer able to distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time he enters into a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it’s still unclear why our brains make cabbages.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality provisionally.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis because they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our head), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and brain trauma.
Surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or poorly cohesive; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, love sickness or other exceptional brain states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one but her hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a weird dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She wakes up and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the other visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations visibly and audibly.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep to arrive, which is often late and scarce, she does not know whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
Hallucinations have disappeared a year ago.
Since she's been in contact with psychologist Kasten online, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, they are very likely to start hallucinating after a while.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it's in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he calls Dad since he has been using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limitation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too consciously focused, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that they subsequently cannot differentiate from being awake.
Traumatic conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor palsy while being fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, he replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after heart valve surgery with a heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he was prostrated in bed, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, it describes your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
More clear and intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publisher at 27 years old
The new publisher Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are qualified for it.
One cannot put one’s children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
This would destroy the children and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the presidency of the board from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the 52-year-old Kallen family has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first I was responsible for technology.
After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he also took over direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the top of the publishing house.
Burda’s sons are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who was now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the 10, 15-year differences," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are also not safe from decay: "This has always affected families who are contagious by the eagerness to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought that they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That was never my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as was Springer, and I don’t want to play with Time in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Anything you want – in terms of beauty and well-being – at your fingertips.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is responsible for laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where tea stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a Jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxión.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
As, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costumes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it aims to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote the activities of Research and Technological Development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and, in particular, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, envisions "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In presenting the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the financial year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," said the president of the government.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of brands to continue in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" of registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of motoring.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you will find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Participating companies will include, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, catering; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and catering; or Classic Cars, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Tests of Ability Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be conducted with classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not in conflict with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop – a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we see that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument cluster and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a spacious and regular-shaped trunk.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and the six-speed manual gearshift.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced rumour, for the performance and for achieving a contained consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high riding comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
The standard features include the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In return for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us great doses of satisfaction every day.
'Premiere' de luxe
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, with no possibility of even seeing certain kind of attachments or browsing the network.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
In view of the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It’s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and has long been around.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and a good glasses to read the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated ear pulls to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is a fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name Fon when it lacks WiFi) gets this type of rates means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope it is because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American first lady.
If he has already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greeny yellow with shiny reflections -, the two times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric -, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaur.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with a print.
Accessories have also varied: green half-heeled shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, mane releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Feundity and career path of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start first living together as a couple, advance the first maternity, and have more children.
In contrast, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay cohabitation and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, although less on the timing of mating," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and when they have the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and at which they have the first child.
There is also a difference between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average, respectively.
"There is also another division between women based on their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those at middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris signings, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives – designers and models, from yesterday and today – gathered at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court and Justice.
No one was missing the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in some cases, also the other).
It does not do so in the foreseeable and fearsome genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent spares no scares or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a poignant invitation to reads and rereads.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against acient fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
"Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the knife blade that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjugated the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north wall, from which the best climbers descend again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and sometimes that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the background of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to worms."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Dear God, please make me stop writing like a woman.’
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after the life full pleases death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "In the baggage he also brought his depressions.
Her husband accepted normally that she should tell him that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man’s fame to serve him as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking around our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed next to her and our dog, a mixed-breed specimen, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they tipped two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our outrage is capital because we do not find the amusement in a gratuitous assault on a small and helpless animal, which, by the way, was bound.
To this must be added the hot flash that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when she instructed these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energumene attacking an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened at 5 p.m. on any Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt will serve for much and not generate susceptibilities, just clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to mistreat for free a helpless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said that it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign promoting the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
The sale of light commercials rises
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and that of the sellers Ganvam.
The good data, not osbtant, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the upturn in the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 units have been sold together all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of the light commercials: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect its demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
Thus, to the constraints of the closed tap of bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this scenario and unlike passenger cars, the purchase aids of 2000E have served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed people and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been a testament.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sales association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (passenger cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As with ABS anti-lock brakes and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of lack is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by their way of working, it can also help prevent many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant increases the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's stepping.
But it doesn’t always maintain that pressure until the end.
According to a study by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not hit the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four accidents with harm to people would be avoided – when so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - as reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM says a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new prospective buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes on the strength of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
Behind the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to develop its latest and most expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, in the first place, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by a canvas with manual operation, which saves 21 kilos; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; riding sports baquettes another 19 of 12 and with the l.
Finally, renouncing the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door handles for cloth, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual clutch PDK gearbox, the test was conducted on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, mainly on California side roads, on mountain sections with really twisted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as immaculate.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the contrary: we hadn’t been testing a model so small and light that, at the same time, it conveyed so much safety in the passage per corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short gear for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and re-squeeze his engine...
Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands at the wheel is what the car will do.
And you will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already premièred in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either from a standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that is more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate with Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer lavishes her pouch face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant win by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated court of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties that had the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way is placed in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 valuation).
The Victorian team was able to replace the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although they had to suffer until the end to get the victory.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had much to do with the final victory.
The game started head-on for the Azulgranas, who were from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already presaged that they had jumped to the Israeli court with hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main makers of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with whistles and applause on the return to where he went home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' rating of Splitter already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on the road to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court does not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elias' squeezing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More inconveniences
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but by no means dead, needed to spin a couple of plays correctly to get air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), who managed to make up the locals at the end of the third-57.
The Alaveses left to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what had been deserved for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had owner and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent fighting the Unicaja
Unicaja lost sharply in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the cashiers, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and also by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of venues in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, conato fight, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss due to injury from the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal fouls, were weighing on the cashiers.
Among the domestic players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the 44-32 lead, 19th minute.
An Impossible Comeback
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, was superior and even equalled the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, 27 minute, which made the group's leadership shake.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences the Unicaja by the direction and triples of Cook, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when squeezed and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatia's Nikola Vujcic managed to regain the basket average 81-62, 37th minute, and Unicaja went off, delivering the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and motor in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by that of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the net in the last three months are that of driver, part-time and social worker.
Brazil announces departure date from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, when he would officially end his term.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by rejecting Zelaya's political asylum status, which the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, once again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly giving liquidity-free bar at near-zero rates for financial institutions to purchase assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its year-on-year auction next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have picked up again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was once again affected.
Once again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the chosen haven for investors, causing a widening of the eurozone countries’ differentials with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral hazard advocates who were once again trying to raise awareness about those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, the Dubai issue paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and the one in Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that throws away the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor’s is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not foresee much life expectancy at its warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "caution, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is debated these days.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Natural Gas-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants are open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be $60 billion, but up to $95 billion.
Of course, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue changes and power needs to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, yes, with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill of Sustainable Economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to incentivize the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to fight climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "timely" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be made because they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, which has not gone beyond economic terms, has a five-year term.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona races its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are his rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the last phase compete three consortiums with a remarkable presence of European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liza, and his colleagues are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest specialists in underground works.
Against the team of Acciona plays the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the sieve is the so-called LBRJV, where share capital the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but carries a clear entry difficulty if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Billionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (north link), is called to link the western Toowong Highway with the Kelvin Grove bypass (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane traffic.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the final months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per way, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (A$308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit for Hochtief, which announced yesterday that it has obtained a contract with the government valued at $154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fiber-optic broadband network.
This action will offer quick access to the internet to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has moved over to the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, where work was yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million euros
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia worth €64.5 million.
The contract comes days after the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million euros.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended by 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the contest called by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for the creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined 63 million euros for curbing competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recidivist.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since their origins
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
So much so that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well standing in this distribution.
The white club has been the third on the continent to pocket the most money for participating, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also made the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four from Italy, the three from England and the two from Germany).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body that chairs Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will allocate €413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received €2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for tying (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, compared to the finalist’s $5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, was pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the main, and has four assigned places.
The previous year’s champion is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The group Nueva Rumasa unveiled yesterday the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a public takeover offer (opa) for all the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest of 1% per annum.
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If realized, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible buy offers and the judicial swings of their former managers, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created post that will be directly dependent on the chairman of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to the societies of the Salazar.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will uncover new diversions of funds.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former counselors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV authorizes the Paternina exclusion opa presented by Investora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion opa presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by understanding that its terms comply with current rules and consider "sufficient" the content of the explanatory brochure presented after the amendments introduced last December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which may not be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools for Car Testing
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating part costs and labor time can be a lengthy and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Disaster assessment and maintenance service and solutions providers are dedicated to collecting the information that manufacturers provide them, then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the valuations are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of appraisal and information processing tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by manufacturers is far from straightforward.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car goes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is made of each model where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it is a massive sales model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If you are a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars that are marketed in Spain.
The most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and the preparation of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for valuation of claims, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total sinister.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious damages in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official manufacturer prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for damage assessment, breakdown or maintenance of the automobile.
The GT Appraisal Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at an annual rate of 20% in the last three years, and in 2008 it turned 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Solera Group’s worldwide turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online Auction of Crashed Cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scraps and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been deregistered cannot be recirculated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a replacement.
Cars with historical value can be discharged even if they have been discharged after some farcical efforts.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it requires a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, an actual graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated manpower times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn around to see the inside face.
