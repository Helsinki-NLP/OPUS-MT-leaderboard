Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benign condition, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are curing.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 results in a more severe disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develops a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the momentum of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy alone.
Obtaining Cumulative Number and Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19 Cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities of different countries as well as WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
This data was used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. with data from Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 developments in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 before experiencing a drastic increase around February 28, 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks or less earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in responses from national public health services, potential variations in case definitions as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement the current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed a significant discrepancy in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive and intermediate care per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios related to the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a 90% risk of over-capacity in intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the CEVID-19 Rapid Risk Assessment.
Since cases have hitherto been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally host a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be compiled at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As underlined by the recent rapid risk assessment of the CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-VOC-2, moving from a containment approach to an mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for policy makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country can step up its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a spike in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) epidemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far led to more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted through bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is far more transmissive, affecting older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article strives to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this rapidly growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, forever marked the Chinese, who were forced to remain cloistered for the entire duration of the Golden Week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, which is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan and quickly spread to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is “the number one public enemy”, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, particularly in the areas of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds.
However, during this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
Today's COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recent history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, outbreaks of pneumonia of then unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
In the meantime, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO described the epidemic as a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.
As the situation changes rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but more predominantly in the 30-65 age group.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was developing into households, mainly in Hubei province and on the outskirts.
The average time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the mass displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5> 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single-stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the envelope binds to the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and to the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the epidemic, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium of the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a lesser infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b as well as a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domains or functional motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in complex with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for coronavirus recognition and infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civets and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be clarified.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would imply homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, the pangolin - a long-nose mammal feeding on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a significant difference, so it is advisable to expect conclusive results to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally devoid of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, in particular on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs), and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T cells, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
The helper T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to support the defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious damage to the lungs as well as other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multivisceral failure, or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more at risk of being infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 reported cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, with a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective duration of the quarantine period according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow for early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported from two recent studies of a family and one outbreak following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19, which is consistent with a higher MERS lethality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
With respect to SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and sore throat (13%-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for about 14-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, with 66,576 confirmed cases globally.
Comparatively, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it has been for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a gathering or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often traveled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients may be carriers of the virus again, highlighting the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts &lt; 4 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L and lymphocyte counts &lt; 1 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L, as well as elevated aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are observed in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or frosted glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In case of ARDS, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes causes a decrease in the level of surfactant and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to swell and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most troubling chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte desquamation, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection of SRAS and SRAS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR technology for SARS-CoV-2 detection purposes, which makes it possible to identify synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 equipment between 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L and 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L without a single microliter sample.
It is to be hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality, if its use on clinical specimens proves conclusive.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, physicians can only offer supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was offered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all developing antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nonetheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the leading cause of death.
Thus, breathing assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
An excessive immune system reaction has been shown to result in cytokine shock in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, in particular TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine shocks, especially for severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine shocks include modulation of the immune response by T cells, blockage of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab, cytokine-reporting suppressor 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, taking high-dose steroids had no beneficial effects on severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would result in serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, thus significantly affecting the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids was recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Redemesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
In light of these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to enable a number of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B-cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, in association with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Moreover, in view of the therapeutic effects, it is necessary to carefully consider certain drawbacks associated with plasma.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to look for antibodies effective against the major proteins in the virus.
This would rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, posed according to the theories of the TCM.
Most of the effective components remain little or not known at all insofar as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a severe form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rates of COVID-19 healing were seen in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu Province (63.7%), Ningxia Region (50%) and Hunan Region (50%), while Hubei Province, which used only 30% of patients with COVID-19 healing (13% plus the lowest rate of COVID-19).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing a treatment using Western Medicine (OM) only and a combination treatment combining OM and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear symptoms and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone.
More impressively, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM remains to be clarified through controlled trials conducted on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a strong concern about this highly contagious and deadly disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience feelings of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, an acute state of confusion, and even suicidal tendencies.
Compulsory contact search and quarantine, as part of the public health services response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt for the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma of family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, as well as any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subjected to lethal provocation as well as their protection against zoonotic virus infection remain to be determined, as no clinical trials have been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and critical goal to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the significant delay (18 months on average) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without any sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main prognosis factor for SARS, and this appears to be the case for COVID-19 as well.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% aged over 50 according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age of 66 years vs. 51 years), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and the presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognostic factor for disease, treatment response and healing.
Correlation between CRP and severity as well as the prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to the prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: chest X-ray results and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in supplemental treatment for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since taking high-dose corticosteroids has been widely used for severe SARS cases, many survivors have had avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the death of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to offer psychological support and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower airways, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper airways and causes no or few symptoms in the first phase of infection, similar to coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubated individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impairs the control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore far more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Significant efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost the entire population with a view to disrupting transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the declining phase will last 3-4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not go out in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
One Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples from the middle nasal cornet and throat of recovered patients, 2 weeks after they were discharged from the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic flu-like episode.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual decline in new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Initially, the Ebola virus was expected to result in up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectiousness to eventually extinguish or that it evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, revealing a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
Thus, precautionary measures should be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, the relatives and colleagues of patients, and even anyone who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first possible line of defense to reduce the risk of infection lies in wearing facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be passed on to other people.
However, only N95 masks (1860) provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles manage to pass through five surgical masks stacked on top of each other, it is imperative that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear tight-fitting insulation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have penetrated his body through the eye because of inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one meter from the patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited inter-human transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a noticeable relaxation, especially as the whole country prepared for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies must learn from it and take the necessary action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as every word counts and can affect population behavior and decisions; (2) show more sensitivity and responsiveness to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal responses from physicians or official bodies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a population's potential epidemic and attempt to target population rather than population.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
To the extent that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak is born as a dej<0xC3><0xA0> vu impression.
However, there are notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was predominantly transmitted by severely ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients may again be positive for the virus.
This greatly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain unresolved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from chiropters.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, e.g. bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, although it can take time, to get answers to all of these questions as well as many others.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to end this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS occurred in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In addition to supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could generate approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of between 4 and 7 days, with the peak viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, misaligned liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory tests in case of suspected SARS.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokine shock, which can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present all over the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and sustain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses known in humans.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCovs (HCoV-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1, and HCov-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained post-human transmission, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community-based HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
With this in mind, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by forty or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without host animal reservoir or intermediate.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbors a close ancestor sharing a high nucleotide sequence homology.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses HCoV continuously and over the long term.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of the animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of the r-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 SARS.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels are HIV positive for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the airways, but also through the fecal route, which is also the main excretion route for bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between the beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be from bat CoV, whereas the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs from bats close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First, unlike alpacas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Then, the alpha-CoVs of the HCoV-229E-related bats are numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoVs of the alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In reality, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility is that, while alpha-CoVs in bats serve as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoVs.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the interspecies transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known through its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels who have gone from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in transmitting MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in transmitting SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats via carving or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2-linked virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cutting and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species having been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research into the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the new hosts.
Nonetheless, the mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation to humans.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs change models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for CoVs observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in connection with transmission
Beyond these three viral factors listed above, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, a study by electron cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of this bond 10 to 20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCov receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase for HCov-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCov-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: Back to the start box
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but encoded divergent ORF8 proteins.
This suppression splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10, and in some nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to have recombination episodes between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating a mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to CoVs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROD) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response of the host.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Remarkably similar pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoVs have returned to the ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stand at a distance from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during home births.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or hand dermatitis, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, soaps, and other protective agents to prevent public health (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural dirt- and bacteria-bearing oils.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid microorganism removal activity; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you do not have water and soap on hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, benzalkonium chloride-using formulas have shown long-lasting and cumulative post-application antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is attenuated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the earth or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not to mention the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to re-contamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, gaps between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and flaky nail varnish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap is not available. For example, running water from a suspended and pierced can or gourd and/or using economic ashes if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited, such as in schools or rural areas, solutions to water supply are available.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging jug using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in the public toilet is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After hand washing and drying in a hot air hand dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and by 254% on the palms.
Air jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
Following hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
A pertinent analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, it should be avoided that the water on the forearms flows to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributed to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being conducted to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that claims to foment changing behaviors.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to foul odors called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good handwashing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had these kinds of thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

It should also be emphasized that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary modifications of virus genomes, which are most likely due to the pressures exerted during selection, in particular by the host immune system.
The loss of complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E may be cited by way of example, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in HCoV-229E-associated bat and camel viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a reading frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with VOCs, indicating a mutual adaptation between VOCs and bats.
It seemed that bats had adapted well to CoVs from anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by VOCs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of molecules of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROD) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without causing a strong immune response of the host.
This is where the secrets of observing asymptomatic carriers and what causes cases of severe infection in humans reside.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market were found to carry SARS-CoV-identical viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were identified.
Remarkably similar pangolin beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was man-made, either voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoVs have returned to the ramp lights due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of VOCs in bats and other animals significantly altered our perception of the role played by zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Numerous evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and civets in the markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the slaughter of civets in them could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
According to the same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from fresh produce markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of numerous beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There is no shortage of opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the ravages caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics favorable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are sensitized to the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of VOCs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing transmission from animal to human and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stand at a distance from ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
The secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins might share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to contracting SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the quasi-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of diagnostic criteria for “suspicious” and “confirmed” cases of COVID-19 is needed
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Rapid Recommendation Directive for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this directive outlined our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new, our knowledge and knowledge is gradually advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a “suspect case” and a “confirmed case” according to the latest COVID-19 (seventh version) diagnosis and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that now officially bears the name of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO called COVID-19 a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge is slowly advancing based on the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published in seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially changed.
As our guideline received feedback from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Version Trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), confirmation of a suspected case must associate one of the epidemiological history features with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history of symptoms: (1) a history of travel/residence in the Wuhan city and in the neighboring areas of the population; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids of the population); (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids of the population);
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging showing the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspicious case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the whole viral genome showing strong homogeneity with known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive serological test for the IgM antibody and IgG of the SARS-CoV-2 phase-positive or SARS-CoV-2 modification-positive-specific s
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the airways or in blood samples has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as airway samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as "low-risk".
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspicious” and “confirmed” cases, we suggest that they follow and comply with the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19-related deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19-related deaths in a single day.
The country thus records a record of mortality due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of contaminated people recorded included 114 active cases and 33 people cured, who remained confined at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the confinement of the city until May 1.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an HCoV infection could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also make it possible to better understand CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The genera of Beta-CoV contain the majority of HCoVs and are divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications for the prevention of future infections.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the airways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, including headaches, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present all over the world and appear to be transmitted primarily in winter, in temperate climate countries.
Stores in Australia cut limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on buying toilet paper to two and one package per purchase at all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a packet limit.
These limits were posted in the form of messages to the checkouts and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers were apparently amassing reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction of four packages in effect, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery," and called the demand "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
Sales saw a "severe increase" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the allowed quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a planned promotion Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local board restrictions on truck delivery schedules make the task difficult.
It forecasts higher production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honor Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a voluminous item, resulting in stocks of a reduced quantity that, once exhausted, leave large empty spaces in shelves, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, it will likely reduce panic,” Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent paper, have stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, said some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers were on leave during the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday’s edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report in which they announced that they were not planning to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current epidemic of COVID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of the disease, and not to the hazardousness of specific cases, the WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“We are deeply concerned not only by alarming levels of spread and severity, but also by alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in remarks published by CNN in February that “apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its onset until its continued spread globally.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that “we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
He added, “and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the epidemic: “In short, the situation is going to get worse.”
On Thursday, the Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international scope on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are healed.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral therapy.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by putting in place travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world’s student population.
Misinformation about the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, as well as others from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decrease in travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known symptom-experienced person had fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear product-related to the subsequent outbreak.
Of the cases of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to decline in China but suddenly increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK population must be infected before they can achieve effective collective immunity.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, 86% of undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated, and that unrecorded COVID-19 infections were the source of infection in 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the baseline reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are curing.
For those who do not heal, the delay between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were among those over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 pandemic death counts typically refer to people who have been tested positive for COVID under official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 could be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased people - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of COVID deaths.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged “We know [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the underestimation in the United States. Such an underestimation often occurs during pandemics in January 2020, as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic confirmed the first of 2009.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health.The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global case-to-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case-to-death ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between January 1 and January 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after February 1, 2020). Other indicators are the lethality rate (lethality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the rate of succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and track a specific population of infection at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on estimates of lethality.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic is uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: “Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack of available hosts.
But it’s almost impossible to make any relevant predictions currently about when this will happen.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said that “this could be over by June” if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus—because it spreads very easily—will disappear completely” and that it “could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosa), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakenings, and seven severe bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent progression of the disease, severe pneumonia, pneumonia, and shock may result in pneumonia.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost smell was initially 30% before dropping to 15%.
Some information about how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is presumed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without protecting yourself can project droplets from a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted through fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected by exhaling, particularly by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people located next to them or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause airborne spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted through the stool, this risk is considered low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, such as after coming into contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the outbreak of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in coronaviruses related in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two bat strains.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Comparing the entire genome to date has revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however the final confirmation is by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanning.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, because many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “the scanner should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19.”
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a rhinopharynx sample, but it is also possible to use a throat sample. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral frosted glass opacity and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Society of Radiology is currently building up an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-unconfirmed imaging is of limited accuracy to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scans to PCR and showed that while the imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect features of the virus in imaging on both x-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who have already been infected were advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many Governments have prohibited or discouraged all non-essential travel to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for someone who might be infected are advised to take the usual precautions as well as the precautions of contact, and wear protective glasses. Finding contacts is an important method for health authorities to prevent future infection and prevent future transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps were launched or proposed on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s presence near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing your nose and gargle with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after being in the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after bedwetting, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (one minute of exposure to stainless steel surface disinfectant), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a nursery, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronics such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or handkerchief when they cough or sneeze, and throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance traveled by the projected postillons by talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing a mask can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.”
The WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they are caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it recognizes that wearing a mask can help people not to touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their population to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in cases of proximity (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without masks or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of a mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone can protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket should wear a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, forced train and intercity bus passengers to wear the mask on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any trip, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also called physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
We can apply the methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting our travels, avoiding crowds, greeting each other without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum range of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany started physics banning public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a weakened immune system have been told to distance themselves from other WHOs to have an increased risk of serious illness and complications. They have been asked by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible and to contact them in areas.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for people diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and those who believe they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation, and many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals in the most at-risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission is very important were asked to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Strategies to control an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is implemented in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, as well as introduce other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to inflate the pandemic by reducing the number of baseline reproduction to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease epidemic is trying to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Among the non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public measures of social distancing such as the closure of schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in them; as well as environmental actions such as the cleansing of areas has been aimed at preventing them.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued warnings about the displacement of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have quarantined themselves, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because otherwise, transmission bounces back quickly when measures are released.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing for existing treatments.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications or drinking drinks as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO said that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including devoting available laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and isolating staff-tested COV-19 capacity, and isolating staff-tested patients to positive COV-19 capacity.
There are various theories about the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are usually related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus is from one of these animals; in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. A outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hospital of Hubei Province, who informed Wuhan CD 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan health authorities to initiate an investigation in early January, and in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by the Chinese New Year migrations and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major rail junction.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted travel and put in place border controls.
National responses have included containment measures such as quarantine (also known as home, shelter or containment orders) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subjected to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people in South Africa are confined in the Philippines, and about 59 million in the Philippines.3
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world experienced some form of containment, with a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019, indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
China’s National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “manifest evidence” of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as “the largest quarantine in human history,” a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat the additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China has converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as congress centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government introduced new measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending Spring Day holidays.
Universities and schools in the country have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been instituted in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
Population movement control has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced some form of travel restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being “imported” from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the beginning of the containment. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when the policy should end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Affairs Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming holiday, although the central government has asked families to pay tribute online to respect the physical distancing and avoid a COID renewal.
It has been confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a dramatic increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a rally in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji worshippers visiting Daegu from Wuhan have been suspected to have been behind the outbreak.
On February 22, 1,261 or about 13% of the church's 9,336 members reported symptoms, and South Korea announced the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
South Korea has introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population for the virus, isolate all infected people and track and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
The screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile app, virus screening drives delivering the results the next day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is seen as a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korea's society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government’s mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, praising his reaction.
On March 23, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that as of April 1, all people arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.

An unrelated outbreak of COVID-19 was later detected, with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the epidemic, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people in 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. government’s leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the United States took some time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were tainted by defective testing kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental testing kits (universities, businesses, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for being eligible for a test until early March (required doctor's prescription thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
On March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.

Only those South Africans whose test was negative were repatriated.
The test results exempted all South Africans, including crew members, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all of whom, as a precautionary measure, remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at the Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the United States began partially withdrawing its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 protective masks to the Wuhan Bridge as well as other individual protection equipment.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts to protect “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”

He subsequently sent 5,000 screening kits, 100,000 protective masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
Ma has also donated medical equipment to Canada, and the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic have expressed concerns about masks and screening kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus screening kits with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to come from China, but they were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the regions of Latin America and Africa, and on 2 April the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment hampering prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government “provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the Lunar New Year.”
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to enforce a travel ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while it was "certainly not a WHO recommendation", it was a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is the most concentrated" and he spoke of the "confirmation of an infectious disease" in China.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to the “risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: “There is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade” and “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel”.
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency of supporting those countries that “do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it was about to appear.”
Tedros then said that we were “as strong as our weakest link” and urged the international community to “invest today or pay more tomorrow.” On 11 February, the WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the “force of the entire UN system into the response.”
As a result, a UN crisis management team has been activated to coordinate the entire UN response, which the WHO says will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies will be able to bring their expertise to manage the wider social, economic and development implications of the epidemic.”
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China in order to send international experts and WHO to China in place to support national management and assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by preparing workshops and meetings with the main national institutions in February and to conduct corona field visits in order to assess the "impact of response activities at the level of the provinces and regions in the world should be done."
In response to the development of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives said that the global coronavirus threat assessment had gone from “high” to “very high”, its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Programme, warned in a statement: “This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared,” adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid “the worst.”
Ryan then said the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, adding that such a statement would mean that “we absolutely accept that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the WHO said the coronavirus outbreak could be called a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was “extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO faced significant criticism for its inadequate pandemic management, notably due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition calling on WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to postpone his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone had the right to benefit from relief interventions and that this was the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
Experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in China’s Hubei province.
Several provincial directors of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were relieved of their duties following their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of policy makers to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary general Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan in favor of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus,” declaring that in China “censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was later labeled racism by some opponents and intended to “deflect attention from its administration’s inability to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining a communication ploy apparently drawn from the National Security Council, whose strategy quoted is as follows: “It all comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including through press conferences and television appearances.” News outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that “China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending a priori aid to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. officials have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own country.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which is affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “Only China has responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-ranking political source” who said 80 percent of Russian aid was “little or not helpful to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane charged with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that “in offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment have gained speed, they will be able to give them back the same if necessary.”
The scale of NATO’s planned “Defender 2020” military exercise in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO’s biggest maneuver since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the people of the countries in which they operate.”
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country was struggling to fight the epidemic due to lack of access to international markets due to U.S. public funding sanctions against Iran's universal child leave. The epidemic has sparked calls for the U.S. to adopt a higher health care system common to other richer countries, notably the United States.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after it announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided over the response to President Moon Jae-in’s crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, praising its response, and the pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to govern by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections, and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government’s management of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to fight the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption in plant operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several localities have also faced panic purchases that have resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, rays, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has warned of delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world and the WHO warns that it will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity for daigus to sell Australian products to China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food products that followed, these two areas were spared by severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and illegal trade of essential products were a real success, avoiding the severe food shortages that had been projected in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its large agricultural output, Northern Italy did not see a significant decrease, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, as members of the Chinese government unblocked pork reserves to ensure sufficient livelihoods for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: according to a March 16 media report, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing hub, the viral epidemic has been identified as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerges on potential exits.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An expert’s estimate from Washington University in St. Louis indicated an impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have been “scattered” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to declining demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 following a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concern about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indexes including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their sharpest drops since 2008, with a Dow Jones dropping to 1,191 points, the largest day-to-day drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign debt rating, but retained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to fears related to the coronavirus, with the largest decline seen on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures put in place in a timely manner by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to a drop in demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the UK regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached a level never seen before.
Several stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The outbreak coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving significant crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year’s celebrations, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Numerous events related to the Lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year’s holidays until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen before that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has risen to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year's Eve festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store opening hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a 50-60% decline.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleaning frequencies, installing thermal scanners to monitor customer temperature and cancelling events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could leave an additional 14 to 22 million people in extreme poverty-free situation in Latin America by Latin America.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, much of the roughly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for help from the government.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily salary) unemployed 900. The survey of the Angus Reid Institute has observed that 44% of Canadian households have lost their taxed jobs since 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a government-subsidized partial employment scheme called Kurzarbeit.
The German scheme for part-time work compensation has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both salaried and independent, globally.
Arts and culture organizations have attempted to maintain their (often state-funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which take place in the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on the radio, online and live or television, while others offer to practice their worship in drive-in.
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome which closed its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian health minister announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and their inhabitants from entering the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.

The most important sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be “rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021.” Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has pushed many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of entertainment has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as those on Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the theme of the coronavirus have spread as many favor humor and distraction over uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist sentiments expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
As the epidemic spreads to new sensitive countries, Italians, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has raged on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased levels of racist insults, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus,” a term seen by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and students in large Indian cities have reportedly been harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the West Bengal Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them “false”. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as “foreign waste” that should be “eliminated”.
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles related to the open access epidemic available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or people who were asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using various methods, in particular the nasopharyngeal swab or the expectoration sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep airways by aspiration catheter, or sputum (expectoration) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" device shared by all public health beta-coronaviruses, and the 2019 ReRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Real Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests achieved inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of testing at the Atlanta CDC, which resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial laboratories began screening in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing one device to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted an authorization similar to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA EEA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is under development in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide rapid flu results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a test.
A bibliographical study from March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary x-rays have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT scans may be conclusive even before symptoms appear."
Typical symptoms visible on DMD include multilobary bilateral frosted glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, “crazy paving” and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to MDD in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that MDD is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that “DMD be not used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The automated high-throughput systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single peripheral blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required prior to analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities who have duly informed the agency and who, as a result, can now distribute their antibody testing.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan under which suspicious cases can stay at home, "emergency department will provide a patient with a sample tube", patients spit inside, return it and later receive the appropriate test result.The UK NHS has announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk of a suspected patient's need to infect them.
In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 tests a day in an outpatient setting, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of 000 samples were combined by at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing, at least 5 days of sample testing.
Thanks to its 5-day construction overseen by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
As of March 4, 2020, total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Free multiplexed models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be run in small laboratories without a liquid-manipulating robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, UK and US.
This situation has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes in order to continue screening.On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing the majority of its population per capita for coronavirus, and were in progress.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct drive-tests and the purchase of a population-wide broadband laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test kits at the onset of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide the specialists with sufficient testing kits and recommendations to meet.
In contrast, experts say that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended intensifying screening programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the stockpiles of swabs and chemical reagents have depleted.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had “flaws,” so the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it will remove the kits that gave wrong results, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia purchased from China 1.2 million test kits that turned out to be failing.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a “high error rate” and that it did not “use” them. The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by forty of those who achieved a positive result, and tracing of people who had been in contact with carriers of SARS-CoV-2, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, conducted two sets of tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Nearly half of the people with a positive result had no symptoms, and all the cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened by the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that the countries with the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analytical capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column “Positive in % of tests” depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also called hand hygiene, is about cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Systematically washing hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via the oro-fecal route.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have water or soap on hand, you can wash your hands in ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after wetting or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, animal feed or waste of animal origin;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people handling food or working in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as reducing the infant mortality rate during home births.
According to a 2013 study, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Actions to promote handwashing could reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income regions.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhoea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) - an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading IRAs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary measures under the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or hand dermatitis, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among health workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (micking, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish or raw meat.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent disease transmission, including before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or wetting, after touching animal waste or handling animals, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand soap cleaning is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 in 54 countries and dealing with hand hygiene, 38.7% of households on average were washing their hands with soap. A study carried out in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the rate of hand washing was the highest (97%), the United States was in the middle of the chart (77%) and China showed the lowest rate of hand washing (23%).
For example, the Philippinne Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with fluoridated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser since lipids and proteins, which are organic soil materials, are difficult to soluble in water.
However, an adequate flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that “liquid soap vending machines are preferable.”
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended for people who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, soaps, and other protective agents to prevent public health (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural dirt- and bacteria-bearing oils.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have found that the use of warm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly called hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin in order to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and ERV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, flu and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol remove 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand sanitizer or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands as well as the gaps between fingers and nails should be faced for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
It is also advisable to clean the tips of the fingers by rubbing them, palm to palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid microorganism removal activity; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you do not have water and soap on hand.
The frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions can lead to skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of the alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the latter remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, benzalkonium chloride-using formulas have shown long-lasting and cumulative post-application antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is attenuated after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Among low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, but instead use ash or land.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the earth or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands properly to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Foam a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not to mention the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to re-contamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily re-contaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, gaps between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and flaky nail varnish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; dry skin promotes the appearance of skin lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when tap water and/or soap is not available. For example, running water from a suspended and pierced can or gourd and/or using economic ashes if needed, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited, such as in schools or rural areas, solutions to water supply are available.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a hanging jug using a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in the public toilet is debated.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the hygiene levels offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying in a hot air hand dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% on the finger pulp and by 254% on the palms.
Air jet hand drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the device and possibly contaminating other toilet users as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows microorganisms to be diffused at a maximum distance of 0.25 meters from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
Following hand drying, the following variations in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Washing hands with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during travel, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing illness in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a bristle brush to remove them.
As the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The goal of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, with a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%, and the World Health Organization has published a brochure outlining the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in health care.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines prepared by the Organization can also be accessed on the website for feedback from Internet users.
A pertinent analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines “Five Indications” for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (the "drug" or "antimicrobial" soaps) gives the hand washing agent an action of germ destruction.
It is desirable to scrub these germs before performing a surgical operation, scrub them in environments where the organisms resistant to antibiotics are very widespread. To "srub" the hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching with the hands, to scrub the base of a brush to wash.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, it should be avoided that the water on the forearms flows to the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, it is advisable to dry the hands with a sterile linen and put on a surgical coat.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after caring for a sick person.
Regarding the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits of increasing hand washing frequency beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with ordinary soap to antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, it is found that the first reduces bacterial contamination by 2 percent.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing the influenza A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, to put more alcohol-based products at the disposal of the staff and to provide them with written reminder verbs.
Further research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool for preserving health and even feeding properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities for washing hands at home, at school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economical options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be attributed to stubborn habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting handwashing with soap and conducting awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing with soap and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
In order to achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing the handwashing rate in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. Regarding the promotion of handwashing in schools, one can cite the example of UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach ", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures for themselves.
Once the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to the final three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are being conducted to reduce disease and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that claims to foment changing behaviors.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e. avoided DALYs).
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers who have just given birth or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, in Austria, and in Florence.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to foul odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a critical means of preventing the spread of infections.
The onset of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to greater awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating “good handwashing techniques” were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term "washing your hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or be an accomplice to something.
It comes from a biblical verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertakes to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imaginary stain, symbolizing her bad conscience in the face of the crimes she committed and which she prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and value handwashing devices more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having had these kinds of thoughts are less likely to engage in other compensatory “purification” measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe handwashing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing rituals put forward in many religions, including Baha'i and Hinduism, Judaism (tevilite) and ablud.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
COVID-19 workplace risk controls designate the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary by workplace and task, based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, routinely cleaning and maintaining a work environment.
Average exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected as a result of ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density work environments and certain high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of an encounter with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected or known COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, moving to very high risk if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling of people with suspected or known COVID-19.
Appropriate risk controls for such workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of other people, or fear possible exposure.
Business models can change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means of acquiring them (including shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted and an infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used as a guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the necessary controls to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations likely to arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Outbreak response objectives include reducing transmission among staff, protecting those at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The Risk Control Hierarchy is a global framework used in occupational health and safety to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on employee behaviour and can be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls refer to changes in workplace policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, appropriately adapted to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal professional contact with the public and other collaborators.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory label, including covering mouth and nose tools to maintain coughing and sneezing, providing handkerchiefs and garbage cans, preparation of work routine and disuading hours of work.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease remain at home until they no longer exhibit fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever retardants or other medications to allow employees to take a symptoms. They also advise employees to apply flexible leave policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to an area with widespread COV-19 transmission.
In addition, it encompasses the worker's work in contact with the general public especially in schools, high-density work environments and high-volume work environments. In addition, the worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker' worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker's worker
Workers in this risk group rarely need to wear respiratory masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating a member of the crew to take care of the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient, or asking the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated organic fluids or surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent coughing or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag intended for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls shall include the postponement of travel in case of illness as well as self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms occur.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the individual's cabin. For school and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the case of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or canteen meals, by increasing the space between the offices, staggering arrival and departure times, reducing infirmity and using non-essential visitors.
In the case of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of the school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and seat belt before reuse using a household wipe or detergent spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE, as well as for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funeral workers to belong to categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they perform procedures producing aerosols or sampling or handling samples from patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs at high risk of exposure include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with suspected or known COVID-19 at the time of their death; they go on to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19, including when performing procedures that produce soil.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some sanitary and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using Level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people working within 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtered respiratory masks or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and worker comfort. WHO does not recommend suits, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, care for or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or facial shield, gown and gloves.
In the case of an aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a supply room occupied by a COVID-19 patient to people directly involved in its care, the use of PPE necessary for specific task only, the continued use of the same PPE for diagnosis without breathing mask.

We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building on a global scale that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we are fortunate to work.
I could not be more grateful and proud to count you all among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the sites operational, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned above, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
We focused on eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to take a step back, don’t worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, i.e. 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, go shopping or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we say it.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please notify Bryan of T&C Ops so that T&C can help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management.)
Hourly staff will be fully remunerated.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honouring our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow hourly staff members.
Everyone will be remunerated on the basis of their usual hours of work performed under normal conditions.
This is true if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to get rid of their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve yourself.
We simply ask you to contact your supervisor, so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are certain things that we must continue to do.
The SRE, Ops HR, Trust & Security and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to “work twice as hard to make up for lost time” when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will endeavour to establish new objectives and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily work time targets, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to set a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, care for themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and the pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and we will inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Location, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of over-caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol which uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork office, which shared with us and all Washington DC-based staff members its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco’s advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the idea of renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but could be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to working remotely are aware that adapting can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings to sessions of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider spreading them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchange.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or perform a collective note-taking).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about job distribution
The HR Operations team is studying webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized in the event of delays or changes to these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both saddened by the upheaval and relieved by the clarity and the opportunity to focus on one’s own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the follow-up, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Staying in touch despite COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can still find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members residing in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or need help with anything else, please feel free to prevent and work with the CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure the liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these amendments should be considered a relinquishment of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at the present time, our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we deem necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to bring our movement the help it needs, and to offer the world the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
We need each and every one of you to achieve this, which is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminated peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminated renal amino acid transporter collectrin domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein of type I, the enzymatically active domain of which is exposed on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane mainly of the cells of the lung alveoli type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I into vasoconstrictive angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminated amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro).
ACE2 can also cleave several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the spicule S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 at the surface of cells results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment, leading some to believe that the reduction of ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitor and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, especially victims of stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less probable than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovative treatment for severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature to support these Bluetooth apps.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, while Singapore has opted for an app called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided in open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was pending approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications based on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and based on the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-tracking application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and living in Moscow, to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple only allows “official” or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is remote.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in government projects:
surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
the extensions of control and surveillance should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control objectives;
Data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalisation are not exacerbated;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined by law;
protections against abuse and remedies should be provided for citizens in the event of abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists to ensure that all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalised groups, are “significantly involved”.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used for contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracing information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracing and card transactions data, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed following the profound changes in information privacy protection laws following the MERS outbreak that affected that country.
This information is accessible to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralised privacy systems.
Details of this had not yet been released on April 6, 2020.
Privacy tracing is a well-established concept, backed by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols encompass Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitives and ContactP for Mechanism.
These protocols ensure that personally identifiable data never leaves the device and that all mapping takes place on the device.
The MIT Media Lab’s Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad audience.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with privacy-enhancing cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deploying tools for governments to create official, privacy-friendly coronavirus tracing applications
Google and Apple plan to address the problems of solution adoption and persistence of monitoring by initially distributing the system through OS updates and later removing it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reassignment or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) refers to the conversion of a drug approved for a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
This is an area of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion from convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24, and on March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the U.S.A. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians reported using this drug “when there are no other options.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen said favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the existing evidence in favour of the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up opportunities for the Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), an antiviral combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that “no benefit was observed”.
These drugs are designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is attempting to modify these drugs to find a compound that would bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about the use of resources for the repositioning of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Gilead Sciences created and developed remdesivir as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg viral infections, and Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir has in vitro antiviral activity against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate pathology and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two controlled for placebo (China and Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a Phase II trial is ongoing with 200 patients to recruit from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian drug agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study involving 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic broke out around the world in 2020, prompting major investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of CEPI’s vaccine development initiative are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 with the aim of creating an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The primary platform targets passed in Phase I security studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists said in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, including 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in the process of planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, controlled against placebo and conducted in several centers all the while, determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active-development vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human evaluation phase (still in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that it has begun work on a vaccine, which is expected to start testing on humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it has begun work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and that they were starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it has started a vaccine project with the aim of creating an Ii-Key peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans “within 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plan to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located in western Maryland, announced work on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical test projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported developing a particle similar to the coronavirus through partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “large sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,” prompting protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in the preclinical testing phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that human testing of its final vaccine candidate could begin in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium including Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total US$29 million investment of the CEPI against COV-19 vaccine to the development of a COV-19 vaccine.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence by China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of $192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used in the event of further coronavirus outbreaks.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that “subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by microneedles triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the potential form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the immune system’s production of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, coupled with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for implementation of Tier 3 biosafety containment measures for the manipulation of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS were a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS spread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, only one DNA-based MERS vaccine had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were ongoing; all vaccines were viral-vector, two adenoviral-vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts spread a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of taste, and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced on exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than pose an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during later stages of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing the mask by the general public vary, with some authorities not recommending its use, others recommending its use, and still others requiring its use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to see a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections reported today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and saliva can both carry large viral loads.
Talking loudly releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protecting yourself can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission might be possible and that air collectors positioned in the hallway outside patients' rooms produced viral RNA-positive samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can disperse respiratory secretions and therefore cause airborne spread.
Although there are concerns about spreading through the stool, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spreading may be possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives for hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, disabling it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia linked to the outbreak of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in coronavirus-related viruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) that is most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of those admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be linked to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) has been observed in intensive care patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have shown diffuse lymphoma damage (DAD) and infiltrate.
Although SARS-COV-2 exhibits tropism for respiratory epithelial cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF-secreting T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, a nasal or sputum sample may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours or even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody testing (probable to detect active infections and a person's previous infection) was in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first closest-to-patient test on March 21, 2020 to be used by the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multilobary bilateral frosted glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the onset of infection.
Pleural dominance, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended covering the face with tissue in public places to limit transmission in asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
Distance guidelines also include respecting a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no known drugs to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Given that a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after bedwetting, coughing, or sneezing.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulas for local production.
In these formulae, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy, and support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat cases of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Reanimating physicians and pulmonologists in the United States have gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
As for symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in conditions of care where performing procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an airborne infection (AIR) isolation chamber in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions. The CDC highlights the guidelines for the use of pandemic personal protective equipment (IPA).
The recommended equipment is: PPE jacket, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (U.S.).
They are designed to protect aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-indicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or as a last resort, artisanal masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided using a high-throughput nasal cannula or double-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical condition.
Some physicians prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-throughput nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older adults (those over 60, and especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, limiting the ability of the care system to treat a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung injury associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being clinically tested.
Redemesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs under testing are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral drug can be tried in people with a severe disease.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments, and the FDA has granted temporary authorisation for plasma from recovering individuals as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been submitted to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect “close contacts” using monitoring data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Mass data analytics of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure was aimed at enforcing quarantine and protecting those who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect non-quarantine people.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that “40 percent of people continue to move”.
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a moderate course with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory diseases such as a cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of those in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 percent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples exhibit diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac injuries due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing conditions, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also impact mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The under-counting of moderate cases may lead to an over-estimation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The hospital administration in Hong Kong observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scans suggest organic damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered an aggravation of a latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms dates back to December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are usually used to assess mortality.
These figures vary across regions and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from diagnosed cases of COVID-19 clinically or epidemiologically timed without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (LR) that reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying of the disease and the infectious lethality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) dying of a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and track a specific population of infection at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among men in their fifties, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and development of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age in men than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not collecting data associated with the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “COVID-19”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus and D stands for disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the coronavirus 2 linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as “coronavirus.”
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as “Wuhan coronavirus” and “Wuhan coronavirus.”
In January 2020, WHO recommended using the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup retro-designed and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to certain other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “SOLIDARITY trial” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to penetrate human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being researched.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body in the event of a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the speck protein S that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (vaccination by DNA or RNA, a new technique for creating vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries expected in late April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that double that dose is highly dangerous and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein starting with serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the A2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine shock may be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokinic shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is currently undergoing a nationally unrandomized phase 2 test in Italy after showing positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to be causing the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have cured COVID-19 to people in need is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody-based treatment can generate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of patients cured and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
