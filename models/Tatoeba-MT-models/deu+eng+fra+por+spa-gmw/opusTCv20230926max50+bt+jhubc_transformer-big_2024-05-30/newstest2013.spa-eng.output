A Republican strategy to hinder Obama’s re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less prevalent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of U.S. governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread following the November 2010 election, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw their right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's even more.
In many states, students, voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 resulted in a drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shortening the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of voters, which is equivalent to 24% of citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fiercely opposed legislation restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Getting Tested or Not Getting Tested?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which useless medical interventions are decided.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
Do you take the test or not?
We have asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States found a high rate of infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between the patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been performed.
I recommend, therefore, the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case you should opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not to have the test.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the declining number of smokers.
Tobacco is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Peso
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer," they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risks of developing colorectal cancer.
Deli products should also be avoided.
Preserving the meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
At the moment, however, his investigations are inconclusive.
According to CSC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risks of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of discussing each other’s concerns and family history with his or her doctor.
"Doing the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What is more, it is the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or “less bad” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, as the chances of making a mistake seem few. We'll see what it's about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up hurting yourself.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" consisting, roughly speaking, of some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to The Particle Adventure website of the Berkeley Laboratories, which is by the way extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I could underline here, are not the exotic bugs that we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave is born (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it requires extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an icy pond in which only a coarse rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN’s (the big hadron collider is a 27 km ring in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not.
But what can all these investigations “contribute”? asks Ms. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many fervently want them to meet, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as that it does not offer any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The impact of such research on our day-to-day lives is hard to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say we won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution their work would provoke.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, initially the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Just imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light pickup in 1969 in the course of his research into optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this pickup now serves as an "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Dying in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still a lot to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see him up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he was destroying had given him a two-year break.
"I had been given five years of life, but I have already been seven," he says, made a pass, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived at the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly agrees to be helped to eat.
Brave, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who devote attention to him, bring him medication and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that I get cured of my diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“Over the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois centre.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
Ms. A., 89,’s greatest fear is dying “consciously and drowning.”
But the disease has made her discover her children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, one last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, since we know that we will all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer controlled for their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died over the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days pass without ever being equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer," Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarvent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care facility.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative shortage in Quebec’s health care that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care eminencies, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," she recounts, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in the Emergency Room suffering great pains without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the right care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s hopes for survival were already low when she left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that she wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask to die thank their caregivers who have not attended to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative home care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can’t pretend we don’t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want relief.”
The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from the health research institutes of Canada.
Huge real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
An "industry" that came out too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system gets pulverized once we’ve hunted the mainstream media,” jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlements linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the then liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved $1 billion in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission has “already brought down two mayors,” he adds, while he hopes to be able to “demonstrate the ploys behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of government intervenors, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau squad", who, since 2009, have made the "sink cartel" of Montreal moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial recording of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and the other side during the 2000s, awarding more than C$88,000 (about €68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the ruling liberals.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation in the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills between 30 and 40 percent for fake extras.
In addition, a mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filling his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits."
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are clearing the wounds but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
- Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is above all worried about the role of the "elect politicians aware of the ploy".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to fund election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "unless election expenses are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we can't fall any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I move forward from day to day by your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get warm.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by leaps and bounds.
You'll benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me feel like fighting and giving everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by adjuncts like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course I will.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away the position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the eighth-finals in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to begin with, to finish the first of our league against Porto in order to receive the round of eighths.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means for this project to be realized.
Not winning the cup in League 1 as in last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in winning this title.
Last season we didn’t get far.
In May we got a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have totally accepted it.
After we beat Troyes 4-0 at home, they still find things to blame us for is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have not managed to qualify for the eighth final, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s successes.
Let's say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he has been through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I can play good matches in the national team.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have an exemplary behavior today.
What is your vision of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "blues"?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
This game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching the top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (quotes are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
It is nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competitive with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as “credits”, used to advance a video game and which can be won by playing or bought (and even occasionally redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both depository of ledgers, verifiers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file cutting, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "cutting" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in deposit.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the potential for money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Major players like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the “giant sales” were launched.
“They changed $30,000,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes strongly in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus cheaper.
The bearer, in addition, manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to prevail, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also plans to re-evaluate the various risks, which are now considered high, should this currency succeed.
We've come out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have mainly punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advancement between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country shrouded in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing government land to resell as plots for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from massive U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are filled with both girls and boys.
We will have to give jobs to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains and strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper ores from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the vast buddhist site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to re-establish normal relations.
French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to “win hearts and spirits” and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of “civil and military actions” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and had brought through a small French NGO numerous collective work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These jobs, which are keen to obtain local labor, have helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased areas of cultivation.
What will we leave as a memento after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, they would need to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever on the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
It caught everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when it announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial messes.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues to “betray his word” and “trampling the right.”
On the part of its supporters, it is said that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he claimed in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamist, voted yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators, on the other hand, are amused by the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on late yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the subject of all eyes, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "principles" could be replaced by "standards", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of this university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of civil status.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civilian judges competent to rule on all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the military’s wishes, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to go out on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the full nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Cross or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Via Dolorosa").
It begins at the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for Jews, the Western Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will then come true.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge from the enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by their own means, can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Up there, from the foot of the hill there are bus services offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In one trip, you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private Ralli museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health (disambiguation)
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathes there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, brine and healing muds and to fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route between Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, she led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph themselves.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you are traveling to Israel, do not worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1-3 $,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling by any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
On Sunday morning, a new working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, flake-free fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
On the streets of Israeli cities, no stray dogs are seen.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk at their liking" in imposing ways.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snoringers love crowded places and do not reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, it goes for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The majority of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds 51% of the same rate of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are arguing about the consequences the law would bring on compulsory examination, there have already appeared in the country scammers who trade with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed home.
From 1 December a law comes into force, according to which every work immigrant must take an exam to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become compulsory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, but also that of Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examining centres will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the People ' s Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take part in tests in all cities, now more than 160 such centers are open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the State Duma deputies and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, managed many times to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering "working slavery".
A lot of people are talking today about defending the rights of working immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, get a "paid trip" to a creepy, narrow cow, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” confirms Tolib Sharipov, the head of the Directorate of Labour Immigration of the Tajik Immigration Service.
Don't be angry, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much his fault as his own misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, putting them on shoes and buying them what they need for school.
When they reach adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the law on language is concerned, rights defenders point to an important point.
Examinations will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Prohibit Strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Umed Hushkadamov, a Tajik citizen, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be cunning, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be forged.
Several “false” certificates of knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which there were luckily no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on possession of weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented the BBC news service of Russia, the criminalist lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in organs of the Interior, compared with a total of 1,168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to turn to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black market is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Staff.
Screenshot of website accepting gun orders
The first, "army or military remnant", that is, weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven reports that some fires were deliberately set in motion to cover the fault," one former military official said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their granite of sand.
“Now private arms factories have proliferated that are not competitive in the international market and distribute under-the-cord weapons to the black market, including the one in Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes handcrafted, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s guns have arrived there “due to the fault of officials whose work is related to guns,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked that his last name not be mentioned, says that guns found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers head to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through some ensign, the supplier purchases a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
"This one takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan is to be followed, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
"Like a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would take me to a "skinny" where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I found out only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to arrive, say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had lost a tooth".
I can even get a pair of steel gloves through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I will not betray him.
Newbies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there wasn’t “anything.”
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
To the buyer, according to Baranets, they do not offer cat by hare: everything there can be tasted.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Couch Shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the ad, “Buy a gun or a machine gun.”
There the users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthography preserved).
"I buy TT. Moscow pistol", laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish, to bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send you a photo and instructions so you know where the gun is hidden,” said Dmitri Kislov, the press secretary of the NGO “The Right to Guns.”
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you run out of guns and are put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish, to bait, and then to mine coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, making up 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against low wages being paid in Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and tame in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of the protest organizers is to create labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", on which the orgy of rebates that captured millions of inhabitants, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes, began in the United States.
On that day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many underpaid Walmart workers buy only on the job.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
In the words of two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" protesters demanded salary increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any losses to the corporation.
Black Friday lasted in stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, his cash registers carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post that they had quit their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "another PR trick," organized by the labor union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely the Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for that reason for now there are none), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
No one earns less than they do in this city.
How it’s possible to survive in New York with that money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teens were passing through McDonald’s and working there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they were still living with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs begin paying at least $15 an hour — doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be set up in the fast-food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing union activists with cunning and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, particularly City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as city mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said “we must support fast-food workers to achieve the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest manifestation of its kind in American fast food history.
But it involved only a few hundred people, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of augmented reality, so popular with fans of modern technologies, is lately normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual Google conference, it demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are drawn to the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to person-computer interaction, but we also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
The world of computing must be liberated to our own, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it can not be considered a panacea, it remains to resolve the privacy issue, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are you lacking resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects human-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the cameras’ location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you will be able to see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the film "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands feel nothing!
What responses are your group preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It records the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone is blowing it into the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Do you make him think that he feels what it seems he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like those in gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality appealing to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg’s avant-garde of the late 1980s – early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I devote myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grey arouses aggression and agitation of properties not good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with those who were later exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I sank into the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for lyrics.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... for me it was important to meet in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to come together.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical arts club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many shows before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; the basic education and training they received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll was made in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, thus ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very uncultivated.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which they clearly express the actuality and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is embadurned and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orienting oneself on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And, maybe that person shouldn’t be shaking his hand, but spitting in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We recently saw you in the role of an urban organizer.
Who better than me to be!
- Good, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped into herds, bohemians wanted one thing, simpletons wanted another.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come by thousands!
- They'll see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event 300 people go, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such pictures that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is a concept: a culture official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones, everything was different, the kings perhaps did not understand the culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who evaluate them correctly and make their way.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is terrain.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board set off in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How do we continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, drosophilas.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under weightless conditions.
The result is a normal chick.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
With no support, the chicks flipped randomly.
And after 10 hours in the newborns there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniarch” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our flying gull, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their skills of working in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget about," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In weightlessness the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a totally misfit person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will become a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be the home for their space-born children.
Head of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: The inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" has not found the politician guilty
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is lazy.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) said in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," so describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the office from acting that has an obligation to carry out such checks or demand obligations,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation relating to public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by the legislation in force in each country and then by the practice itself.
We have put it all together and, although the control has not yet finished, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation in our country is "stricter and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate ever stricter rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely this common control that could help us stop investing in the implementation of the laws, the reduction and the improvement of the limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting a right thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because of the fact that we are going to reduce the limit on awards means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As far as the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) operates there, with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The competences are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organisation, the courts of account are even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be specified exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Surely not, but, I repeat, I do not like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, they wouldn't benefit from collaborating with our office, would they?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex-post checks, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparation of the future controls: we have started a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are corrected and the like.
Do you consider that the passage of this law is beneficial, or rather that it constitutes a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous legislation, the persons controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this path begins.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA1>varc system, referring to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the <0xC5><0xA1>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it forbids anything, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the Office from performing such checks and demanding obligations.
You can say, “We change the law and allow it,” but you can’t say that we’ll do as if nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how one should act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for not meeting formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, although they are mostly passable.
In several parts of the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are passable, caution should be exercised in some areas.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region’s road operations control center.
The R6 highway and the first-class highway in the region are now unrestrictedly accessible.
However, it is recommended to exercise extreme caution, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still sections with remains of ice and snow.
There is a need to increase attention on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Roads and Highways Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of Eastern Bohemia, the sky today will be between clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable this morning, although caution must be exercised and adaptation to the weather will be necessary.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some tracks could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from information from the region’s road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the track between 80 and 131 km.
The surface of most first-rate roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, you also warn of stretches with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less-traffic roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road workers removed the snow at night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to track managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are unrestricted.
"In the higher areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are snow remnants.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will encounter medium-waste snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k", confirmed today an operator from the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night also his colleagues came to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are unrestricted, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
Road operators in northern Bohemia reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or ice, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below freezing even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road, but in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
There have been no service complications at the moment.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched over the track with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarmist news that we like to hold on to.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the end of the Mayan calendar enunciated for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, will it be heard at the charity concerts?
Of course, yes, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it at the same time at all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world be used for?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we have completed for the sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav school are regularly visited by teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We seek to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar “spectacular action” planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of the fact that we are in America, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have performed for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in an electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprising me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that in the east there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what respects should we take the example of more developed countries?
There are many areas where we go behind...
But it is important to mention that perfecting and improving the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this regard, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers to emerge, it will begin to really change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not reach until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot by connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work you don’t see is as if it doesn’t exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something differently.
The world of entertainment is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is received with caution and it takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings that suffer and that we should have compassion on.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many ways and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with their heads in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: La<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t avoid it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via video conferencing to sing together The Tap Tap’s song “End of the World, Cancelled.”
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance the multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million CZK.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free admission to the Bohemiaticket Early Sale option
Poland and the cosmos.
Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA at the European Space Agency's meeting of ministers last week. It is the second ESA member of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency's project committee.
However, Poland’s journey to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie Prize in France and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great impetus for astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known worldwide and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresin was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for the start-up of the dresin or for its braking.
The information on this dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933 onwards Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile technology projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM rocket probe (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have an apogee of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatuses.
On the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, on the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and on the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland’s entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
Suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Work Act.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labor costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causing a drop" in the price of the competitor in order to take over the majority of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
All this encourages the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population regardless of social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, by means of the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by means of the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed at such low wages that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
Savings measures in virtually all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation: people, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live badly on the edge of society, in the hope that one day they will reach the private investor capital country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the full that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with fingernails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political march and, therefore, the whole state with its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the sphere of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: the state ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to the industry.
Such bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracies find themselves quickly in a situation such as that described by Appianus in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been disintegrating and administrations were occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread without hindrance and the people went to the polls with the vow spoken beforehand"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was always without a man without consuls"... "He began to be serious about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the "Application" in the "Autismocracy".
The conclusion, just as in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on disregardful preferences of individual benefit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not at its core capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and recent history.
Suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
“If my children didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be any,” Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on Israel’s side, argues for the right to self-defense and encases the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and calls Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the repeated massacres and who is the victim. After all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the Autonomous Territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to discover who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been creeping up for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small surface of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In each era we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or if behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have significant stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, a war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild central bank's Bank of America status, began printing money during the American Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33rd degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second was aimed at eliminating colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third was intended to reduce the population of the land by half a million to a billion people (the same number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a solution to powers).
The method with which the group of the wealthiest families, along with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of the unleashing of crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao – order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like the one in 1907 did not happen again.
So, after the successful assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the outbreak of World War I, they shattered Tsarist Russia with the onset of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and militarily and economically unjustified, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
To prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a conflicting situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, with which this quinta was created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses of the Germans.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which he was initially tied by international bankers or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If the international bankers were to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a front-line victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine for welding and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice breeds injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their eagerness for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
Israel’s current President B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything he can to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global economy and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, where it has only two miles of the world’s crude oil flow.
In what light are the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994 now shown: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-to-do financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls his whole being.
“And it compels everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two foreheads, let him add up the numbers of this monster.
The number dials the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration the situation offered no positive prospect: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since if it did, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to do so a covert story helped an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction superproduction.
Combination of genders
The plan outlined by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example may be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines the moods. On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. The sequence of credits shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were embodied in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes a bit lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And moreover, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men who analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Goodbye Little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed directors of ancient films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "wheeled" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the takeover of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of confusion and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes he adds something to the reality: here it doesn’t all come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis lurks at the Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search behind his runway become madness).
Argo’s weakness is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year presents a survey on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd rules or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in large European companies," said Pravo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Up to now, women have outperformed better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or the guideline darkens the size of the cages of chickens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
There has been criticism of the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spreading" or the withdrawal of the classic bulb from the shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not present "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it only seeks to harmonise the national standards not homogenised to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive carries with it a waste of groceries.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription that in inflatable balloons marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The US referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
A similar restriction on the use of blackheads by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the denomination of Macedonia. In order not to hurt Greece's sensitivity, we must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for canned mushrooms, threatening a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in paying to countries that do not have access to the sea and in the idea of granting a grant for the grant application.
Such ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation,” said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of cereal production in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), specifically for the drafting of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and also more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve rather, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs, like other countries in the Union, also have the right to the denomination of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the denomination of origin of the Olomouc cheese, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the nineteenth century, and it became called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beets.
In the official list of protected EU designations of origin, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known all over the world, the marzipan of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, there are already for example the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and even the variety of l<0xC3><0xBA>.
As EU protected maras, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> kegs.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything went well in our country, then I would not run.
But I can no longer bear to see how it has been stolen in our country in the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are increased and the retirement age is raised.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it is on its way to the presidency.
Aren’t you turning your back on those people who voted for you?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample on anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this is added the media, which discredits you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or to have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above twenty million.
To do so, the law must change.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I was part of a lobbying group for the guideship to be recognized as self-employment, and we did it.
The problem is in politics: if someone arrives with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary groups.
Without boxing or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Does he consider himself a man of the right or of the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we get ahead.
I don’t care if someone is right or left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDG and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
It's a joke when you say you're populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you say?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of the parliament, only slogans remain.
It cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask parliamentary party leaders to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character pointing out disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I’ve just started in politics and I’m trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to get things right myself, but in case it doesn't go well, in six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy for the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did voted for the establishment representatives.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the flawless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have money?
You're talking about property declarations, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youthful dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at $60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put in too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay for the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign cover essentially what I will receive as a senator's salary.
For example, I would not be able to pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t run as a candidate.
So will you continue with your business in order to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly quit my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want him to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep winning.
If I was president, then I would quit business.

The architecture studio MVRDV demonstrates that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly finished "mountain of books" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby who walks down the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: "in addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town on the outskirts of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honor of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for funny and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and attended the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse mountain of books, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain rises at the intended location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade one would intuit rather a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese maker.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to encompass with the view, the annealed brick floor and the elegant street lamps unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the bookcases are arranged along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the center a huge dark room opens which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classic spatial configuration upside down and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall, parapet and railing at the same time.
Sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a thin plastic fabric has been used as a base for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this tissue was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
“Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Even though the mountain of books is situated under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the information technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, the Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a great success in that discipline that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather tricky diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories United Nations observer statehood.
Eventually, Berlin abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still testing what their role will be, but they have already begun the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, she must be careful and not alienate herself from Arab public opinion or the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it that much importance since it's not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by refraining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestine vote?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to gain some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly been in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I think that the real disparity of opinions does not really have the scope that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must propel things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, whether simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a tricky topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to it, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The US influence on European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not cover that void for the moment, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c'est la vie!

'Brand Protection' in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a denomination officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a claim.
And even then it’s not clear that they’re going to be right.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my desk.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters so they can register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada-Kny is registered instead of Prada.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are department stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are of a different nature: on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a denomination that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
“It’s detrimental to the business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are million-dollar, especially in the case of flagship luxury products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The process can last up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had elapsed so long that the name under the lawsuit had already become a “market reality.”
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarism money because the process has damaged the plagiarism's trademark in China," Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, was initially using a white and blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to change it.
Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the labor emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed complaint processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is at the top of the list of new registrations worldwide for the 10th consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in duties would have been pocketed.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese impersonator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has succeeded in securing the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg has been right, but the opposing side is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
Now the case has reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it remains pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the matter favourably and commends the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files that are up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” says Wentzler.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
in particular if the imitators secure there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since abandoned this commercial area, however, managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what you have to do is “register in China everything that may be susceptible to protection,” as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: dancing, singing, helping
Imbongi choir rehearses in Heidelberg and AIDS orphans rejoice in Swaziland
The story of a link capable of surpassing much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heeled shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the vocals of the singers slowly begin to rise (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano), swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his box as he tries to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the homeowner.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a little-known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegirista" in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
At a distance of 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of mud and straw, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest AIDS infection rate and lowest life expectancies worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not like circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s people are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty years of age has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than limited.
In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common STDs of viral origin are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Slashes and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of those affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most common in men who have sex with other men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were recorded.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort with urination, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend undergoing regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their performances throughout Germany, they get to raise a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that the orphans find a good place to stay, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof to live on, and ensure that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are left under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, got many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is evident throughout the country, it is not usually spoken of openly.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and exaggerated lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless seasonal workers who travel the country from one side to the other and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “you can get free condoms at any corner, but they’re barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; such recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to tear off a couple of tears from some angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small town barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
“Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” say the locals.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also icy water, according to three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has reportedly found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It looks like this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, with great probability, asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one associates the ice find with the possibility that there is life on the planet, says Messenger’s chief researcher, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: older stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult thing to recognize is the pink color of "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantly named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This raging image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This budding star could be captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
This is probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Swirl Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the clues of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two galaxies in the process of merging are swung towards each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname Southern Mill.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the dust particles found in a house.
This image was created from optical images and x-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is being built.
It allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The drawback of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone who owns a computer can help by providing processing capacity.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018, it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes at Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, alongside them, explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations ahead of the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is also ice on Mercury’s south pole.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves with great noise through the winding road that passes next to forested hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, other than that they perfectly master Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and which does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely reach this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World's Oldest People," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
The lives of eight dozen local talyshis who have surpassed 100 years of age are documented here. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov’s age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently still had time to conceive an additional daughter at the age of 136.
So has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
“In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very old people also live,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are many older men.”
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil registry.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, instead believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Ruba Mirzayeva, and it is the natural way of life that keeps people young.
At 97 years old he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, she tirelessly moves a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long since become grandparents.
They also jump from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in typical cups with domed shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son discovers proudly.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off and has kept its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
The pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I have never been to a supermarket in my life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, it all returned to its bedside when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when the witness ceded to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well considering the situation here.
And perhaps the grayish son of Mirzayeva is right: "in our culture the elderly are highly respected".
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The term "human rights" is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with sharia as the basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in pathos.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And let that happen is my responsibility, to the people and to God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
All of them, so far hopelessly plunged into confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, the approval of which has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean by “principles”?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal maneuvering space it entails, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: on all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all of Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship these courts served to exert harsh repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's death, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is so inaccurate in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits the "offensive to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
A question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in the face of Islamist superiority for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in Cario and vowed to fail the Act before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be “in the trash can of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “coup d’état against democracy.”
“When we call the referendum, we will go to your palace and overthrow it,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for,” opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, at the University of Cairo.
Many women covered in a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same with the cry: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded that Morsi “clean up the country,” while proclaiming: “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi’s supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should go.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced a trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now the expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear in the new constitution,” he laments in a conversation with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the state caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are blatant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda said.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
Norwegian Rakfisk: The World’s Most Smelly Fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success bears any relation to its greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of overly cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the crippling scent of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It is snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you prefer it.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of a glass of a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "Rakfisk General", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small buckets and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not unlike a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty plagued Norway and in which, before there was refrigeration, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, arrives to this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered important, an essential, though rather smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive, a beer cane or a sandwich cost you a whopping 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
It is hard for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and which, with its long blonde mane and surprising blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an unwrapped laugh.
I'm in the snow queuing for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that stinky fish comes back.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV has connected live with a presenter who wears a bow tie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls off the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces a hard start
As Mexico’s incoming President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads that lead to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but rather to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the management of the nation.
He is faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before colluding with the President of the United States, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of on-site tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of the new roads of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with his name on the entrance of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will achieve real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, the PRI.
“In particular, when it comes to security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was dismantled by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s lack of essence of the new president.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who can listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated stretches of highway is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
On a desert plot next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto say, at best, that he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
“When I got to his house, it seemed as if his body had been cleaned,” recalls Mrs. Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and that one is silent.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect,” he says.
The presidential band that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says the deputy of the PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of abuse of Bradley Manning during his time in prison
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the grounds that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while under military detention.
During an interrogation by the prosecution of Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein stated that records of the weekly visits of officers from the unit Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request that the case be dismissed because his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
WikiLeaks later posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein and Manning reviewed the forms officers filled in after Manning’s visits during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was imprisoned under maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers allegedly asked Manning questions and jotted down his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the caretakers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had discussed those issues and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They were writing 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said it had placed him under that restrictive regime, which lies one degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of other people.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was okay and (wanted) to stop being on injury prevention ... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered committing suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, some clothes and glasses.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday's statement that, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell for a night, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of jailers and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given a chance to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the concierge's order that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she experienced during her time in prison and drastically reduce her sentence should she be convicted in the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to make Manning guilty of misdemeanor crimes and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was detained under the rules of application to any detainee who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely walked down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Posters indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I should go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It’s ethnic shorthand, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italian.”
I later decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle it during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and got in line with foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as he will venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory to gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand at the foot of the war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is what they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was locked the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit in a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this curtain of silk, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you’re not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, from what I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, folks.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unprepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated far less time ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and usual discussions about who started first, heaps of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything torn apart whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make their struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to believe that his deadly impasse could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on Nov. 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have bolstered falcons on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been well beaten.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the world’s most miserable and populous corners, Israel has failed to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time is playing in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a re-emerging regional power that had formerly been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah party-military dominates, through Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels could overthrow Bashar Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn’t have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas’ cousin brothers and their leaders rely more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas will emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep calmer... for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, thanks in part to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase even though they are illegal under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the area will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin curbing arms entry into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention to it.
This attitude represents a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
Generic Tobacco Packaging Act Enters into Force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases wear on boxes of a dull green color, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapping of an olive-green off, horrifying images of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies because they are children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, compulsory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed on a small font type.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
Australia’s federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
He trusts studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
“You can see that children, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited after the law passed.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said demand for silicone slings and covers to cover up the nasty images of the boxes had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a rejection of the law in Australia's Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stock.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector to which the plan is aimed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has come online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet for local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this little window to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in brand reviews from “foot-on-the-go citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the hassle of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry is more focused on what the new regulation entails than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are asserting to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though neither of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images on the boxes.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“Photographs don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
“You take the cigarette and keep the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
“Honestly, there’s only one reason I’d quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, says uniform boxes make it more difficult to place them on shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unravel one delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it’s, okay, it’s over and we close the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not that bad to get a little bored
During Thanksgiving this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But more and more scholars and child development experts are praising the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we cheerfully accept boredom?
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't.
But, we'll talk about it later.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book Boredom: A Lively History published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, it is not.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it’s already been defined and discussed in very different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and putting the idea before a 100-person discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “wanting, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
The difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the attention process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be them.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In their study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading an article from a journal.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume TV show that had no connection, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they struggled to concentrate, but were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, altering attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like spotting defective parts on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or scribbleing — actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom — can actually help combat it, as they make that person more physically alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “trend to boredom scale.”
The scale includes issues like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that I’m interested in that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
It found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when out of school.
3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period when boredom reaches its highest," largely because both children and teens aren't given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance use as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way your brain tells you you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And "that ability to be dosed applies to other situations," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain themselves, but learns to control themselves better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and unsettling to relate to something worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor crimes each carrying a US$100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession offenses are being nullified both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped bringing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally enacted once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have pledged to move forward with marijuana possession cases and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of recently authorized marijuana stores in their communities.
“This is all changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing – all before the deadline, December 1, 2013, comes.
They say, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no true precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
Washington’s I-502 law goes into effect on Dec. 6, leaving a year during which you will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “adequate access” to licensed marijuana and its ban on cannabis businesses within a radius of less than 300 meters from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centres.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Aurora’s chief of police, Oates, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop bringing prosecutions for minor marijuana possession offenses to people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offenses that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been tricky even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer summon adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, a county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana use for recreational use to the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier to district prosecutors,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing marijuana possession defendants and a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that they can’t actually accept it being legal yet,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national trial cases for drug legalization.
While attorneys and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving nominations from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offenses.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hopeful that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While drug agents are likely not to pull down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser.
Several cities in Colorado aren’t waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to put ourselves in a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said City Council member Bob Nicholson.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted for versus voting for what the state voted for.”
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Students are not attacked for their views only now
I don’t remember any moment in my life when I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had been in what I thought was the best place in the world to learn, a contemporary-era Greek symposium that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue a career in history, I had already packed my bags, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had given up because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer A.N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in chunked cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my flamboyant name, or the fact that it came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the Conservative party.
You might be wondering what that's coming from now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred for Conservative Party students is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s JCR say they are “often seriously estranged, personally attacked, and treated as unpleasant people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and portraying the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated like “Turkish heads” by introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of the University of Nottingham Conservative Party Association, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of the left in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, 19, and the president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, an alumnus, an "honoris causa" title after cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the new university students welcome week, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that professors not only turned a blind eye to the mockery of conservative college students, but willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminary.
The first one I attended had to translate French texts of the 18th century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they simply fools?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grumbled.
I returned to my room as a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at dinner time in college; then I felt a slight slap on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They mess with anyone suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many newcomers to the Tories appear to be Labourers.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to cover up.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick proved useless.
A freshman in Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to hang out with people who thought like me only after dark?
Should I become a Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History intended for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
It would break my heart if you let it go.”
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional endurance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had insinuated, totally serious, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside curled up in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me a weak cryer.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only trained 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the show "Valentino: Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Couture", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most pomegranate of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the humble fashion designer of the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty is nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off the butts of their sniffles on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of Alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-requited loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-metre-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the walkway to contemplate a dreamy "audience" that wears masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with the "Aristoteles the Monassis", or the "E".
In that audience of mannequins stand names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-72.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others because of his femininity, because of his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I really like the colors it uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and living in Italy, I dreamed of getting the age and opportunity to be able to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honor neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dressmaker's party dresses with "the utmost care...because a dress is not just a dress, it's also the set of memories it entails."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding costume at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the tailor calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk suit with inlays of pearls, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obsessed for years with the elite’s savoir-être, Valentino is now his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always been struck by her refinement, her calmness, her clean and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest craft in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are playing on life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies upon contact with air.
After plucking large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at turtle pace, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any trash could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who took off years ago on the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur they extract
Once upstairs, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly carrying the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) for each kilo of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three daily ports.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but allow it to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is triple what I would gain in the field.
“The miners’ pay is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the cut was not that hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as blunt as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing with his skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already begun to pay his bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I’ll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he said.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man might be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supplies any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at both the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera surcharge that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a formidable 42-year-old porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and squeezes the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that leave the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and sores in the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight.
By swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at 53.
Each day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat path between the weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest trades in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for having no children.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like “Let’s put a bao (cake) in the oven” to laugh at Singapore’s birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, harbors hope that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do “their national duty.”
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents awards up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 — known as the replacement rate — was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy leading to drastically increasing immigration to cope with declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst electoral result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has come to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have had a lot of sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the center’s financial district doesn’t seem like they’re going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa<0xC3><0xB1>ola it is about the quality of private or "the realm of private life that one has the right to protect from any meddling".
What is private for a child under 16?
How does this definition apply in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by venting situations on the Internet that you would surely not share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very much mine,” on a personal level, and “on the user’s password and name,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t be uploaded to a post,” says Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not everyone,” she says.
In FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I am also entertained by my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who’s making a fool of me,” she says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, nude people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he meets the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just upload them," he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He has no hesitation in answering that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teen has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in which the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated him or asked him for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressured me or demanded it, I simply took them out of my account,” he acknowledges.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
“It just gave him privacy.”
It then explains a series of steps to securely set up the account.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would, if I don't like it or I want it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game,” he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the issue is complex, “because we are asking them to have a definite criterion about what is appropriate to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not make it.”
“Even if they’re selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences.”
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you label party photos, did you ask other people for permission to label them?
And one more, everyone needs to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
“One who is out of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential for parents to read carefully the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or post,” he says.
According to Guardia, it’s key to remind children of the lesson of “do not talk to strangers.”
UNASUR Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders, being made public.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but then they affirmed that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was provided by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the unrest of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it is about the Humala pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that transmission systems were insured for all journalists, but they limited the collection of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that ruled a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the pleadings of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will kill and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are expanding the agreements on residence".
Actions are being promoted to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters.”
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to envision a better future for our peoples,” added Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read out.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his re-incorporation into the Union of South American Nations,” from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations among neighbors, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal respectfully with the maritime dispute following a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
“Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua,” he said.
“With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defense ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay join UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of UNASUR.
“We must achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San Jose Pact on human rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum given to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he does not regret that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, “there was a well-founded suspicion that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that it be subjected to interrogation on its territory for a suspected sexual crime when “Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What is there is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a lifeline that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London seeking a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
And he said, “If Britain gives tomorrow the safe-conduct this is over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and evil politicians but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it is no longer these journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if he is reelected "he will go deeper into the revolution to continue the path and the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in the UNASUR until at least its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'etat clad in legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this failure is not being complied with.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them extensively to overcome them and move on.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment no matter how hard it is."
Referring to the eventuality that he presents himself as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 election, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador’s, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last term in the presidency, and that’s when we left public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It does not mean a relapse in President Chávez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today cause late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the test result: AIDS positive.
“It was like a bomb dropped on me,” he refers to the moment of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to do “softer,” without evident success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about it; with such determination that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affectation to the immune system presented by patients at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not users of drugs: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years.
In simple words, the above means that whoever is diagnosed with HIV-positive at age 25, under these terms "as long as he remains in control he will be able to live smoothly until he is 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
This is what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who require it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida) agree, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to be tested, only motivated because he had done so by a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from common Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the complication.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die already, I better blow myself up three times a week," they say no to my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medications.
To date, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
If they were at risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle motto to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tabloid journalist who has taken up the cause around HIV.
The biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with grimace and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents are not exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be behind the counters and that those hundred be in public toilet dispatchers of the sites frequented by young people.
It’s not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded, when asked if there would be condom distribution in his Administration.
“This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.

There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since by a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling that ignores the restructuring of Grupo Vitro’s debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would therefore be argued that the surviving procedures of signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical side, the endorsement of the June 15 ruling by Bankruptcy Court Judge Harlin Hale for the North Texas District leaves Mexican firms helpless in the face of the possibility of forfeiture of their estates beyond El Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico’s leading glass maker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At first, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main proceeding is the mercantile competition dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law was created, placing itself as arbitrator the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro’s was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Merchant Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, that is to say the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced starting in 2008 to escape the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, hitting the country.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will bring an appeal of reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full of it, i.e. the five judges, since only three voted.
If it does not prosper, Cerciorare’s appeal will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher authority, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which it details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Merchant Competitions Act, noting that he was relieved with adherence to the agreements signed by the United States to tie it with the chapter 15 of the Law.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: they beat Vitro and they beat him to the country.
General Balance
Sleeping for several months the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexican Aviation against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Union of Pilots Aviators has already found the bottleneck.
The case led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Attorney General ' s Office on a transaction by the employer to extract from the F/589 trust of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, of a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental coso that razed with part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
ACTA has died.
The government ignored a demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by deeming it infringing on freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball globetrotter Hector "Hetin" Reyes was linked to the sport of the board for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of minor categories, player of the National Superior Basketball, proxy and leader in the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamon or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I’ve put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at once, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his extensive trajectory, attest to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all, the ones he treasures most emotionally are those that recall his time with the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he served 15 years as a co-sponsor or proxy of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones that I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as proxy, co-advisor or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships running from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s BSN debut year.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, since by 1988 he was already a federative commander.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it should have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Panamericanos in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also had young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Pre-Olympic 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan-American mess of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level like Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Bolivian leader?
That's very hard.
We had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, table officers and referees.
That's nice.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predator oil magnate J.R. Ewing on the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producing house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it she played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at home.
She also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who Shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked at bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment show in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. made her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiator he lost.
Victoria Principal, the co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as “huge, on and off the screen.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each one of us, that we were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the process, the network reported.
There was immediately no Warner or TNT pronouncement on how the series will handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he became an organ donation promoter and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short while, but you'll be fine."
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the Mayan Calendar's "long countdown" on December 21, which many people have clung to as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: Cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called “debt-magedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charme told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If you analyze what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only teacher who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, probable, credible, and impossible," Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a course, titled “The End of the World.”
“We didn’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old undergraduate in Psychology and Nursing, said he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said they believed in the Dec. 21 expiration date.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a senior at Temple, 21, from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge of these speculations.
“Other ways people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any courses about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, “people will start thinking immediately about the next date” or philosophizing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends to make us laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
