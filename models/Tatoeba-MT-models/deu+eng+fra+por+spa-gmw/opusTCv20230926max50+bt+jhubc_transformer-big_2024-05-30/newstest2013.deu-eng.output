A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that election fraud is rarer in the U.S. than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have announced new laws since 2009 that make it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on Election Day, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court record is available.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana’s law.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are seen as voters casting their votes for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in 2011 promoted laws in eight states that abolished voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These limitations are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general election helped to register about 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of registration of new voters in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made up only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, representing 76% of voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the laws passed and see them as a clear objective to influence the results in the decisive states for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 votes required in the Electoral Panel to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already undecided men for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the USA, there were numerous interfering factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that a follow-up after 12 years is 30 to 40% more likely to form metastases if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40, respectively, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made truly understandable of the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not impair the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases he is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be treated are determined with increasing accuracy.
Therefore, I recommend carrying out the test.
However, the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine if it should be performed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows us to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy for the prevention of cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of becoming ill with it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone was eating well and moving sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, that figure would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely harms people’s health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, mast, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against bowel cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing cancer of the anus or faeces.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their investigations, however, are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another more likely showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-existence.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has aroused some excitement last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model – our best or “least wrong” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter – but not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but there is still a lack of data to be completely sure about it.
Still, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be little risk of being mistaken, and let’s look at what it’s all about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that means that two objects cannot be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state", with this "state" largely consisting of some of their characteristics.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, known as Fermione, who are faithfully obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - definitely not this principle, which means that they can, in fact, be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
That is, when a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at exactly this place, roughly like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to show.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be frightened by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - is required to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on its own in the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all this research be "good for", asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to study all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who are eagerly hoping that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major deficiencies, as it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-stroke laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 – already told us that the laser was initially seen as more of a “lab game.”
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its Committee on Dying in Dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate needs to be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“It’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to let himself be helped with the meal.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to cure my diarrhea, because it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man pees standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept a step backwards, he notes.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
Patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overcrowded with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who take care of them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation."
But through the illness I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t have any desires in life anymore,” she says before she accepts being given a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she is still expecting a final visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provide personal care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, a bed for palliative care is available for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That’s very little if you take into account that one day we’ll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died over the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help relatives and patients alike,” reports Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
In the Victor-Gadbois home there is no day like the other.
Alongside a 93-year-old old man enjoying the last family gathering in the yard and being well supported by his pillows while being pushed in his honor, a 36-year-old young man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children tragically dies after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Greater Montreal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes several physicians specializing in palliative care to look forward to the passage of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent palliative care personalities such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to transition to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without any measures being taken to relieve her.
I fear that patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst prognoses sour up to the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued heavy chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I gave up the fight, she said.
She told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not giving up on this desire after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which results in the patient falling asleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we are not perceiving this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to fall asleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction companies, political parties fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell every day what they know about a great “system” in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosos are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has crumbled since drastic measures were taken,” jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was uncovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of misappropriations in connection with the contracts for roadworks in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stresses, "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts," because some were restraining their instincts in order to maintain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Launched in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit, with its troops of auditors, investigators and government analysts, is also making great efforts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Troupe", which has caused the "Canalization Cartel" of Montreal to act more restrained in the artificial inflating of the contracts since 2009...
In recent weeks, she has carried out series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third-largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving lubrication money in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been charged.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission how the "system" for the receipt of public contracts works.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has had his hand in the game throughout the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of $736,000 in return for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, a organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of intentionally overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the eastern part of the island, she opposed the sale of a communal property from 2010, which was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% Black Money in Election Campaigns
Of the investigation, which is ultimately being conducted, she says that it “draws a thread that makes it possible to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants, in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits.”
She says the procedure is “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need an investigative unit only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officers have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is above all concerned about the role of "mandate holders who are in the picture about tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in the funding of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a faint slander of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which it says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot go deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new level with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play on a daily basis.
And with a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the preparatory training center of INF Clairefontaine to my season at Saint-Etienne, I have made gradual progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are accustomed to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the forehead and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Yes, of course.
Ancelotti gives respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're in the ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we have qualified for the round of 16.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to speak out against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group ahead of Porto, so that we can play the return game of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is given the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it’s really important for us to reject this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to take the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a master with 79 points.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Considering what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal that a lot is expected of us.
We accept it perfectly.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something to accuse us of, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people still expect.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to come up with a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn’t managed to qualify for the round of 16 for two seasons, and has also made huge spending!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to be 15 points ahead of the game break!
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance.
All the better that we speak of a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That’s why he came and he proves he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some playtime.
I’ve seen things that I’ve come out of.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blues".
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we need to show good behaviour.
What do you think about the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and pushes for victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the “Blue” to Brazil.
Is this forced draw (1:1) in Spain on October 16 a kick-off?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this encounter in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange like BitTorrent, which allows direct file exchange.
With 15,000 computers on the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After Bitcoin’s price peaked at $30 in June 2011, it dropped to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success”, “competitive with the dollar or euro” and “similar to traditional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that can be won or bought through games (and sometimes also exchanged back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, every time trade is controlled and handled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the ledger, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the account book of the public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding that extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can effortlessly check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay very fast twice (less than 10 minutes) with the same money for cheating, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible up to a hundred millionth, which leaves a certain amount of leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-concluding sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend where hierarchical systems are reconsidered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB’s report proposes to re-evaluate the various risks that are now highly regarded in the event of the success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain ownership of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and devastated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees financed with French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown over by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war due to the fighting of the various rebellious groups.
Their seizure of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into shopkeepers by confiscating government land to sell it as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from massive American subcontracting.
They were in disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as do those who have been able to take advantage of American donations: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series representing a modern world is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be held to be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Private initiative is given priority.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor has spread that Afghanistan possesses immense natural resources.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to reestablish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls’ and boys’ gymnasiums, French Institute at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and had carried out by a small French non-governmental organization in order to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive.
These works, which required numerous local workers, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often more than 2,000 meters high.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which they say is their own wish, the continuation of smaller, more well-controlled and directly affecting civilian aid would be necessary in their favour.
A Constitution with the Crushing Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unrestricted authority, it has decided to put everything on one map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a provisional text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "footstep the right".
Its proponents assure us that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to renounce their plans to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
It’s also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
After confirming in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt they were unable to bring their views to fruition.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed at the time of prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the clock of the Constitutional Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda stunt, are responding to “fake holiness.”
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants Al-Azhar University an advisory function, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt’s specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “those who are asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see in this the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also nurtured by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At present, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system,” said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, reference is made here to the "Fiqh" [Islamic Jurisdiction, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to decide on it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In line with the request of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears about the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, there is no longer any article on the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the top five reasons to visit Israel.
Prostrate in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the conversion of water into wine at a wedding ceremony, walking on the water, the quenching of the sea storm and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries are in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the Way of Suffering or the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave behind notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of the Masada fortress are the remains of the secret hiding place built by Herod the Great for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rocky wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else takes a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain top.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are ancient Qumr’an manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
It exhibits the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of visitors and bathers at the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And it sounds the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
Israel’s three main recreational areas lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sol) and healing mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugary disease and to soothe stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend after all hold that touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre nowadays features evening concerts and operas.
Wishlist for tourists
When you go to Israel, don’t worry about your bad English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is preferred not in euros, but in dollars, which can be changed easily in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city, you usually travel by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stops that connects the lower city with the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is at rest.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you’ll have the choice of different dishes with pork and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (Falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-nourished cats that stroll through the streets comfortably and unobstructed.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Admission tickets to museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
'The Great and Powerful' Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language testing for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the homeland.
On December 1, a law came into force that requires every migrant to take a test that certifies the Russian language.
So far, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Agency, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
It is not only necessary to take language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also exempt from this law are persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, Problems and Protection of Rights
The entire body of examination will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants are able to take the tests in all cities; already now more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law came into force in the press: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to demonstrate language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, responding spokespersons of the Migration Authority, it is about reducing the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must already be protected before you leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination encounter problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who will put him under the guise of help in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of months of his own without food and documents and work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our immigrants.
"At home, you will be promised the One, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be taken and you will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the Headquarters of Employment Migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Swaripov.
Don't scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, admit that they not only cannot master the language of the target country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable elementary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
“You feel humbled and inferior.”
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only immigrants with legal status have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the visiting workers continue to be illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Prohibited Access for Unauthorized Persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are for the most part counterfeit and we are not registered, and this results in cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Just don't shy away from the cost of false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the migrants’ registration documents could be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive these for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to avoid the tests in this way paid 7,000 rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs one worker migrant three thousand rubles.
There is agreement that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time they get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Home Office Ignores Illegal Arms Market
Proportion of legal weapons to crimes extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: wounded in shootings at weddings and seven killed in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was endorsed by the chairwoman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaya, and promised that the amendments to the gun law would soon be presented to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless aggravation".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said criminal justice lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
At present, according to the writers, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police armouries and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military stockpiles.
In many military camps there were often explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military official said.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers are also making a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private armaments factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore waste their weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military official.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated how much each of the five channels has about to supply the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
Most of the illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities, according to investigators.
Half of all guns on the black market have come there because of the “blame of those responsible who have been involved in their work with weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers’ data, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% come from theft in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant for a non-named gun shop assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by anyone since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to procure supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A weapon, for example a TT pistol, is purchased via a flag.
The weapon is displayed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
“The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they are not able to comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically make control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons,” the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had been looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the Begovaya station, where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I only found out about the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and make a date with a code like "from Ivan Ivanovich, who tells us that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming to some hit rings right now about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the punching rings just because he knows that I don't trap him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military official Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album that depicted "everything possible".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military official.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the sack, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or personal meetings are held.
“You just need the right amount of money,” the ad on the website, “Buy a gun or a rifle,” reads.
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," user asks "Ivan" (literally quoted).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are hooked up to the service.

I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the concealment of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can finally go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently launched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are hooked up to the service.
“People come in like hungry fish when feeding and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to scoop up coal,” he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices are expected to range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarov-type gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait for a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons warehouses by mid-range supervisors.
According to official statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand from January to October 2011, while the number of discovered cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
Fast Food and Supermarket Employees Strike in the U.S.

In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Nor can anyone predict whether the protests will swell even further or if they will soon run out of breath again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, when sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handcuffs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, quit their work and, together with unions and left-wing activists, attacked chain branches whose target group are low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paying Walmart employees only shop at their own workplace.
The prices and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed anger that the contribution to the company’s health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than they’re now donating to wages.
If Walmart were to completely transfer the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
That would be $12.39 a year for them compared to today’s overspending.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that there have been protests in only nine states and these have caused no losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday night to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post's website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees quit the work and that the protest was just "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free checkout!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore non-existent so far), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than you in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get around in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. young people were behind the counter after school at McDonald’s, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly encounter people complaining that they have to get along with this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if one does not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue on Thursday, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was a meeting at noon outside McDonald’s in Times Square where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!”
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should jointly support the fast food workers so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves!”
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people there, far from all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, with tens of thousands working in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be moderately outsmarted so far"
The theme of augmented reality, popular with followers of modern technologies, has recently been commonly perceived by the lens of a special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It excites the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched as well.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are an advance, and nowadays, no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still played out on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output so far not decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overvalued?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of object management in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and short rather than expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- What do you mean?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this bubble can?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can’t afford at the time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the next time we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately record people’s reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is it lacking in resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So all the current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X and Y axis, but also along the Z axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly stated, the current 30 fps are too little for gestures, especially.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds in our laboratory in Redmond, where today’s commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera tilts to see how that helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that when it comes to applying the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in your hand when you're on the go, but I think the following: The most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality, where we could switch from glasses to smartphone via a cloud,
Glasses are a personal gadget and this is their strength (private ones can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from being able to work on virtual objects together with others.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often talk about the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection support.
She perceives pressure excellently!
However, there are also technologies that are actually geared towards giving the "pictures in the air" something hand-fast, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently but as weak as someone is pounding over the palms.
There are also wrist bands that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to trick the brain?
Does it make you think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately outsmarted, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is what makes work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list were already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad beard that you can find at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street conjures a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and ensures a good mood with them.
Recently, he grabbed a film organ and became a Petersburg film organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates somewhat from the grey standard causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the days of the old free, but not officially recognized painters then ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevshina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I like theatre, fashion, music, everything but literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation works there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of the Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how String came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
String and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wore tight jerseys and included today's hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became their "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs prior to the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Persons of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and with that I had reached the climax.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be that way.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man a hand, you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you playing the role of an urban organ player, and a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Mikhailov, however, come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings that even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov in a collector’s house.
I started with pictures that usually don’t come until the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
They say they are servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Czars, because the Czars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked because they need higher-level experts to properly evaluate the former and clear their way.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What about you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
It is difficult for art to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art has to be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth inhabitants on board are on the hunt for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I don’t think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
“It’s Mars and Venus,” says Vladimir Surdin, a research fellow at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Half a century earlier, experiments were conducted with plants.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit was not at all different from the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to investigate how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks overwhelmed each other wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely dulled.
The chicks did not respond to light and sounds.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Twice we hatched chicks and then stopped the whole thing because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent to space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats were given offspring.
So far, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered this question: Can it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaya, who was in orbit twice and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts with whom after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is, even in flights in orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydro laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders testified that life on land emanated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother's belly in amniotic fluid, and that it can then become more easily accustomed to water.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth to the first swim.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not come without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze out the child.
Well, let's get around this with birth-inducing aids.
The birth could also take place, for example, in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earthing, the organism cannot form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a workout suit in orbit like an adult does for training.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we are conducting together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to give birth to a disabled person, a completely unadapted person,” predicts Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
Eventually, however, it will become a reality when the Earth inhabitants set out in their spaceships to a distant planet that will become the home for their offspring born in space.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> Chief: Control of the Black System Fails by Faulting Politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but is declining in their application.
Speaking for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, this was said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> kontroln<0xC3><0xAD> <0xC3><0xBA><0xC5><0x99>ad, NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied – and I don’t think that’s the case with us,” Kala said.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he points to the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the prime minister said that the SDGs would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and obstruct the control office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law, in its activity,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a matter of European legislation defining how public contracts are to be handled. National legislation builds on this. Finally, there is still the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find very interesting differences: In general, the laws in our country may be even more "strict and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more precise rules over and over again. One also has to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us stop constantly striving for perfection of laws and for the reduction and austerity of thresholds, if this is not particularly positive.
Economics means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it’s even the case that we only burden the system with excessive “paper crap” in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system will have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds stayed higher.
They talk about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> of the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar in structure to that of us and also has a college, which is merely formed a little differently.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these accounting offices in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds that are managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the state accounting courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a role model in some respects, although it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the auditors are better?
I don’t think so, but as I said, I don’t like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are a role model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our agency, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, and how important the amendment of the procurement law was to your authority, do you feel any impact?
Considering that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our examinations.
Since our checks take place later, we have to expect some delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of uneconomicity" and with it almost 14,000 public contracts are examined and analysed - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the passage of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be adhered to.
Already under the previous rules, persons subject to examination are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) in such a way that any non-compliance with the procurement law is equivalent to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First, let’s say which path is not effective.
The prime minister recently said that the SDGs would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and obstruct the control office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law, in its activity.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing,” but he can’t say that we pretend to be nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think we are missing.
On the roads there is some ice-smoothness, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice smoothness.
However, most of the roads are easy to navigate, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easy to navigate this morning, there was occasional snow and ice.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and only a thin snow cover remains at the lower elevations.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and the first class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and smooth.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, there remain in sections icy or extended snow remnants.
Therefore, increased attention is required, especially in the higher regions.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a risk of ice flatness, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes a layer of snow on the roads, the road and highway management informs on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice slick, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
Ice smoothing can occur in particular on second and third class roads in the districts of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or serene, and it remains mostly rainy.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen district
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now easily accessible, but local attention is required, and the driving style must be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures have fallen afterwards, there can be glaciers on the roads.
Fog is also expected locally, but visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masteries.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the road masteries between the 80th and 131th kilometers.
The first class roads are mostly dry, but frozen through.
However, in the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, there may be ice smoothness in sections.
The roads of the second and third class of roads are moist, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here too.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Drivers who are heading towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc district have to expect snow today.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snow remains on the pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo as well as on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nighttime snow driving forced the road masteries to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district, there are still snow residues in the altitudes.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snowfall towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k,” a <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration official told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Her colleagues in the district of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k also had to go out at night, according to their information, the roads up to the altitudes are free and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district the roads are fully accessible, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district drivers have to be careful in forest sections, as the roads here are still wet.
District <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, District Liberec
In Northern Bohemia, the road masteries report several poorly accessible road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the district <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is closed according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower levels, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads, while no problems are reported from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads there are usually dry.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the I/13 road at the border of the districts <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec.
Blocking the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches being pushed from the snow load to the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think will happen in less than a month?
This is one of those catastrophe messages that we people like to jump at.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re making fun of it and saying that we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce our readers to the project?
This is a nationwide charity event that we have been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to harness the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 9 p.m.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we are handing this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "The end of the world falls out".
Even today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, provided that everything works and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem will be sung by all the performers at the same time at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems are broadcast live together on a direct line from Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperate with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we hold many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most of us are interested in working with us and have fun.
What purpose does the proceeds of concerts against the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been working on for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will create our own building, which we will then move into with this project.
At each concert there are several groups and performers.
What criteria did you select for them?
We wanted to create a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. In addition, we must of course carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I sometimes wondered already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travels abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with people with disabilities there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely non-disabled, where it is still unusual for someone to travel in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course that a wheelchair user is allowed in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we can hang on after...
However, it should also be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to take an active part in social events, we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public eye and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I founded a Musik-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, tends to say, it gets a little out of control (laughs).
But the band has only become known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if one does something and it cannot be seen outwardly, one’s own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In show business today, they often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things out there, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is not only progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and also require a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have to rehearse twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm of many quickly fades away.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop it.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuitry and there is a common interpretation of the anthem "Weltuntergang fällt aus" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipping of a multifunctional educational centre suitable for the disabled, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a meeting of the Council of Ministers, making Poland the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, but they did not always come to terms with it.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was honored, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the earth-facing side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It has not even been clarified whether the rocket should be used to launch or brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents passed on, it can be seen that the research has advanced to the stage of practical tests.
Research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the draft of a photoelectric hunting kite originated from Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski appeared in the trade press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated at the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of space would have a future.
In its early days in 1956, the Polish space company PTA endeavored to join the International Federation of Spacecraft, which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów Desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor to the first RM-type missiles was the Meteor-1 missile, which was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B was 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C was 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
Repealing the non-profit law is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit work.
This decision sparked a lively public discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause of this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wage), there are price tensions.
This term is understood to mean a situation in which the manufacturer attempts to compete economically by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" competition in order to seize a greater market share and thereby increase its profit.
On a large scale, for most companies, this means moving their production abroad or buying cheaply there, or abandoning their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with similarly high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage caused by them as a whole.
This situation is well known, so concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with one another in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus lure foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food distribution centres for the poor for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the minimum of subsistence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all of the EU’s southern states will undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to seek a hunger wage on the fringes of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here naturally the question arises, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or even in Africa, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the dismay that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists narrowly on its position that the state must not intervene steerably in the economy.
Then, however, one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the entire state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby that is ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual prejudice, legislation in which virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, due to the lack of finance, commissions private legal firms closely intertwined with the industry to draft legislation.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer proceeds from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently the liberal democracies are now quickly in a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied with violence.
For lubrication money, by illegally sneaking out advantages, or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went to the election with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "It was really begun to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation thought Pompe was a sole domination, and that a strong man had to be elected by the Cäin, then the Cäin all the team...
Today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least striving for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s point of view, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, with the next round already looming.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today’s elites face the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social catastrophes we are already witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history, in complete ignorance.
Repealing the non-profit law is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s share of capital in the economy, increase citizens’ influence over the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be one,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel, arguing with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs, and calling the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty in these recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It’s about giving readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look at who the 95 years of tension (counted from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are above all useful to.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In any epoch we can identify an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one particularly, which could be called the head of the octopus (I don’t know if anyone else is above them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds back in the nineties of the nineteenth century to stop the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or preparing for them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Ghaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime placing its central bank under the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild’s Bank of America’s status as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed – he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds’ global cravings for power led in the years 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist state systems of Europe, by the second war in particular the colonial rule of Great Britain was to be broken, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), creating an absolute religion (which is not the predominance of ecumenism here).
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the forefront is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not recur).
After succeeding in triggering World War I through the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire through the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the annihilation of the Russian Tsarist Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power Austria-Hungary.
In order to be able to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers, through politics, created a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations; thereby they created the preconditions of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who was to name the culprits and offer simple solutions to a warlike; a much more important factor was the creation of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the founding of a Jewish state, if possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were initial clashes with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was torn from the chain in which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become victims in the front line, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply people divide into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power at the beginning?
A distinction must be made here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as in us, the people, only elect their own candidates.
Israel’s current prime minister, Falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone politician loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything to spark a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly lead to a global conflict of global control, could only spread by Iran’s 2 percent, and could only spread the world’s 2 percent of the world’s control.
David Rockefeller’s words from 1994: “The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the bondmen all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell, except he have the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom; whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The movie Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, which had guarded the patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at hostage-liberation only made it worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover up their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited filming locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by “exfiltration” expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels alternate in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly oversized.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career with this film.
A mocked actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City Without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film not to be set in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that set this director’s previous films apart from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, showing the reconstruction of events that have really taken place – the opening sequence of the message’s onslaught is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, where he sometimes helps the reality - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, which is caused by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are by no means alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses a bit of traction as a result. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and can taste the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day in a certain way, and as proof of how far-reaching the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd banking fees, this year decided to host the contest "Absurd Regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea led us to the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% women's ratio in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing this survey, told the Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible entries from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Some of the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, and the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs much more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also reaped the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of commerce and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks, even with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to food wastage.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be last year’s EU regulation, which requires balloons to be labelled at sale that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU cited an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of suffocation deaths of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground turtles.
There are curious thoughts at home too.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects European officials themselves - anyone who assumes an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must say instead FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated not only the above-mentioned absurdities, but also the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies on the territory of a member country.
The EU has thus set the maximum volume of food supplies allowed to be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or by the idea of giving grants for applications for grants.
These ideas, of course, did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged because we don’t have a sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU,” said Jaroslav Palas, then Minister of Agriculture (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state stockpiles were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally reached the Czech Republic to the point of organising a call for tenders on the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grants for grant applications were offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), specifically to be funds for the preparation of grant applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, but some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union are more likely to be recognised.
A more serious problem, in the opinion of these experts, is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country also evoke the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and this fight does not always win.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the inland community (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or parma ham now also shows up the Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saaz hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can boast.
“People want me to save the republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
I don’t want to be a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn’t run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the republic being plundered for 20 years, how thieves roam freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your voters’ backs?
I have told myself all along that I will start the fight for the castle after the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for President if I am elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function; the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, scold, but destroy anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media that want to take away one’s honor and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
You have started the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive declarations of assets of more than 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been committed to keeping the guide a free trade, and this has been enforced.
The problem is petty-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is intentionally rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from any party what is best for our country without thinking of drawers and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me more on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You dislike it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only be left with keywords.
In the long run, you will not get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side in order to enforce these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors by law.
And the people who have been told should say why they reject it.
A strong personality who points to misdeeds can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I’ve just started with politics and I’m trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work out, I’ll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can’t do anything on my own, so I’ve talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don’t want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of work overload.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade of light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy on the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of eligible voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district leaders.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have the time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there is only CZK 20,000.
You don't have money?
You're talking about financial statements, what would yours look like?
I estimate my private assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million more in my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I've always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant to women and fighting evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors shows that my program probably does not arouse too much interest.
And I am not obligated to run the campaign on my own.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator’s salary alone; so I could not finance, for example, my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
Do you still work as an entrepreneur to get your income?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
This is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have partially retracted my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
Approximately 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would completely discontinue my undertakings.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday issue of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built book mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by by the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby large company, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy city just outside the gates of Rotterdam, is an odd record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library must be here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam-based architectural firm MVRDV, master of daring beam diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with familiar serenity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury was still gazing around and shrugging, the naughty Maas piled up his exquisite contribution to the size of a pyramid and ended his shareholder-backed speech with the words: "Dear City!"
So this is him, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain was dumped.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town retort, which until now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and an astonishingly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: bookeldorado under a cheese bell.
There is a lift in the middle of the mountain massif, but the true pleasures of space and reading can be discovered by climbing the topography on foot.
The all-glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lamps unmistakably speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
They are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookcases stand along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and in the middle lies a large, dark room, which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and pushed the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black bookcases, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes parapet, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, tactics and smell are foreign.
Even inclined architects and civil engineers shake their heads because of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse municipality, at the request of the Standard.
And so one day, in a Friesland farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used in the Netherlands as a root support in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky garbage.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - to plates four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like a new car and a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike, the Literaturcafé not only rewards you with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They ensure the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Troubort.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal heat.
Although the book mountain is under a glass fall, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand transverse to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, serve as shade and capture much of the sunlight.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done with fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already daring to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
For the time being, the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library – currently 70,000 pieces – will be filled.
The concept has emerged.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, now every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called in the technical jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as he may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – but without being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently transforming its foreign policy away from a policy that was managed by the US, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
What makes it more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still tackling their role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the attitude towards the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to confront the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, it’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the United States of America for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
Because it signals that it as an international player must be taken seriously and its interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly advocated a veto.
Are there disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, of course, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual disagreements are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and on the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, especially because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not used to it yet, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a larger role, various anti-German sentiments become free.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to a wide variety of neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is filling this vacuum at the moment, but who else will stay there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

'Trademark' in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the originating companies.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they will be right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for the imitators to register their trademarks.
Thus, from Gucci it is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he is proceeding against the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
“This is damaging to business, you have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
“The brand is being diluted, the uniqueness disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial failures and the process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be delayed, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because, after the long period of time, the name complained of had become "market fairness".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he must even pay the plagiarism money because he violated its trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little staffing and space.
Last year, however, we had returned to normality from the “emergency situation in the work process”.
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still awaiting execution in the office.
Tackling it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is topping the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
In simple terms, each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Tackling it costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was not the case, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the objection of the Munich authorities.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be hellishly careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely time-consuming and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had even had to go through a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
“This shows how much we value it,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to drift back to Europe.
That is, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has abandoned this business for a long time, but it was still able to avert registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but foreigners should “register anything that is somehow worth protecting in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registering.
In fact: If Freudenberg was subject to his trademark drama in the last act, then one would probably have to pay the opposite party royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that exceeds well over 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - press, deceive and chase each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings it together with his supple wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choral voice has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 2,450,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor.
It guarantees the child school allowance, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or praiser.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, the small part of what all of Swaziland is suffering from is the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male foreskin circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation from school, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to provide him with a warm meal a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then takes care almost professionally of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (mushrooms), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless: around 20 percent of new HIV infections are accounted for by this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of an STD?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort with urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not offer 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gages that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have accommodated up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day on time for school.
If you don’t have anyone else, you can go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is best to keep it silent.
A king with 14 wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
“Culture is different – flesh to flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels every two or three years together through southern Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know from apartheid times on the southern tip of the Black Continent.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also degraded some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although the small village can hardly be found on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than well known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," the people there say.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it glowing there too.
NASA finds ice on Mercury
The spacecraft Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is supposed to be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as evidenced by three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets, or possibly asteroids, that hit Mercury.
No one is linking the find of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, chief scientist at the messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small gaze holes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a “planet” according to the International Astronomical Union’s 2006 new definition of the term.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars can be identified as blue dots, the pink "newborns" in the star-circle room are harder to identify.
This star-forming region – unromanticly called W5 by scientists – has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the image of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star threw out in the process of dying.
In the huge Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better to show off.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula on this infrared photo is looking at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius star image.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.

One of the Hubble Telescope’s largest and sharpest images: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour scheme, shots of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid derives from the Latin word trifidus (three-split, three-split), as dark dust stripes triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two fusing galaxies race toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don’t have technical abbreviations, you may call them Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is known as UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Cradle always produces new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, coupled with the rosette nebula, is constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it only emerged shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for stargazing.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger and deeper – and the insights they provide are deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: the telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the elevation angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light-collecting power.
This ranges – despite a comparatively small mirror diameter – close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should cover a whopping 42 meters - and be put together from almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which is still looking up into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to marvel at an illustration.
However, the Hubble Space Telescope provides the most important impressions from space.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets – mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, it was announced by NASA that 1,235 planetary candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The image shows the latest launch preparations at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been suggesting for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Launched in 2004, the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury, the scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day - and turn 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysians, of which not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and are very durable.
The terminus is Lerik.
The small town boasts architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too burdensome.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen talys from the area documented, which is older than 100.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
But the museum’s controversial star is the shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented human being, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely dubious.
"He was born here in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have had another daughter.
So did <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov charge a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"Remarkably many high-age people are also found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "extremely many very old men also live in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific proof of age should be kept, especially since registers of personal status were missing.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many high-age people live here in the South?
The Asian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is about nutrition.
However, the fact that the calorie-rich diet of talys, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter every day, is not exactly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that tirelessly rolls her back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long since been grandparents.
Two small children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in line and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought food in the supermarket once.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
Worst of all, it was in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
Propaganda sounds strangely from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven around the father figure of the nation who ruled his country like a dictator hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijani elders.
230 manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long ago grayed-out son is right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country’s deep division.
The future constitution with the Sharia as its basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said he had, almost apologizing, temporarily cut off the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a Ph.D. from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are concerned, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles flogged by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour nightly Parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what do we mean by “principles”?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and there is a fear that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the legal leeway that comes with it for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least one newly added article: In all matters concerning Sharia law, Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great radiance in all Sunni Islam.
That does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the removal of the judiciary.
Much of the draft text is a matter of interpretation.
Also problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress oppositionists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, according to the draft, “protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values.”
This is legally so blurred that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the wording that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke enough at the expense of a lawyer?
The matter of interpretation, like so much in the draft, which Morsi has for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual agreement on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring down the Charter even before it could enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs "on the rubbish mountain of history".
Via Twitter, he accused Mursi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the counter-demonstration, but as a precaution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi, “Clean up the land!” and asserted, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would probably have evoked civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word 'human rights' doesn't even come up"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have been going until February and should have involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in a conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Morsi’s expansion of power to all three powers in the state resigned the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto puts it out of place,” Saeda said.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, “You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards – not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country’s secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
You have to imagine the nose-stunning smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to go away.
Rakfisk is salt-sprinkled trout, which - depending on how smelly you would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk general" also hosts the festival.
Around us people eat small cubes of fish and consume large amounts of alcohol.
“Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” says Havard.
The spirits can suppress the smell.
I tasted some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near your nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish were soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in the fall.
In the deepest winter, it was then taken out after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol - consumed.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians in search of work were forced to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who not too long ago was far richer than Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, albeit rigorous, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t make it to the world press often, and most people don’t seem to bother with it.
Here one still hates to name Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the “July 22 incident”.
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for Norway’s wealth today has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with ripe Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and sharp blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very empathetic, we don't like boasting.
Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money they did not have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have had enough.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening the stinkfish is again on the menu.
The hotel I’m staying at is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging sense of smell – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
As Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, BBC’s Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but on Monday a steel ring was erected that blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will take over the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proved economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which are a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with his name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and ongoing changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who serves as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, which works for PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has set great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, which the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was deployed to fight drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left in the last two years alone on a patch of wasteland near a large landfill.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico during Governor Pena Nieto’s tenure, a statistic that even exceeds that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he at least did not adequately address the issue of women’s killings during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body stiffness had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is attached next to a cross that carries a single word: Justice.
But this, so the family, has been denied to her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a gossip, a troublemaker, a scolder.
They just want to accept their judgment and keep their mouths shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Binding on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term.
“I hope that as president he will be the way he was as governor,” says the PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors say Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
Prosecutors Contrary to Bradley Manning’s Allegation of Being Abused in Prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a dismissal of the indictment due to harsh conditions of detention
U.S. Army Freedman Accused of Stealing Thousands of Confidential Documents
Prosecutors on Friday tried to determine that Army-backed Bradley Manning — accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history — missed several opportunities to complain about the alleged mistreatment he suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination of Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to dismiss the indictment - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard time in prison - Manning had testified that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning passed through the forms that officials had filled out after meeting Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he had been held under heightened conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein interviewed him on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as “excellent” and the treatment by the facility as a whole as “very professional.”
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints about abuse, although officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) 'No problems', and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observation status to "prevent injury."
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status — which is one level under suicidal risk — for his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational status for injury prevention ... to be able to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what is going on with him or in the outside world has been distressing.
“My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he had tried to stay in motion because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - for example, he slept naked in his cell in Quantico one night and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
At the interrogation on Friday, Manning said he had shut down the blanket he could have covered himself with on an order from his guard, but he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, trying to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the waistband of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his length of detention should he be sentenced at his trial in the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained under the regulations that apply to all inmates held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transfer of national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of chances
Mexicans tend to blame emigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when inconsistency spread in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irene" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
Later, I chose “Mexican-American.”
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I also do not get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and lined up for aliens.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans nowadays are just as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartels, even though he did not give details in this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s preserving gun leadership to give them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official makes even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the country’s elites about how Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma set out on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge in truth lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, one person — perhaps a parent or grandparent — didn’t get a chance in Mexico and emigrated northwards.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty goes to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now have lived the American dream, attended good schools, and got good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living — not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership don’t like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans dislike them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they belong neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to resume their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional “ambassadors” for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify its ties with Mexico.
Well, now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge at how their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual accusations, countless buildings have been laid to shreds, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets have been struck from Gaza near Israel’s Tel Aviv metropolis and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there is reason to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems anything but appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hard-boiled on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its group itself suffered major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are invaded in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, temperate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a rejuvenating regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken sides with Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Rejoicing Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist imprint could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region in a lasting way.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is consorted with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers – not least thanks to the blockades that have flowed into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared to be in violation of international law.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians coddle and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their fellow Gazans?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to win, but the Arab spring could make a cut through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense status is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in restoring their economy.
That pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a truce could be a promising sign — and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still being deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside.
The correct answer is that represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and this newspaper: two states where Israel is ceding territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by exchanges of territory and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama, too, has to help move Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he is equally reluctant to participate.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children suffering from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, is from next Saturday.
Australia introduces the world’s most stringent tobacco packaging regulations.
The Australian government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
Studies have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at age 26 are 99% more likely to not start smoking thereafter.
"You can see even in young children that they understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws favoured black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has risen enormously since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian court with their challenge to the law.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units at wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, the catch lies in the popularity of social media among precisely the population that the plan is aimed at.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, barred them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most merchants to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising through local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noted an increase in brand experience reports written by “all-normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or is a marketing agency involved with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry instead of marketing is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries trade larger with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a photo of a mouth tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the “King of the Pack” tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says uniform packaging has made it difficult to replenish his shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
“The government should have just banned cigarettes altogether – then we would have said to ourselves, okay, that’s it, we’re shutting down,” he adds visibly angry.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored, too.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane went down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to get bored with a few thoughts.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying – even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts refer to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us — and our children — to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us nowadays are almost constantly staring at one screen or another, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn’t think so.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom that dates back to the first century.
And then there’s the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it."
Boredom therefore differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
With apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a feeling that time is slowly passing".
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re boring, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band in front of a person's article in front of a magazine.
Some groups listened to a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who listened to the barely audible television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for them, and attributed their troubles to boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, if you perform a monotonous activity - "like looking for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, it can distract music and help you not feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that rummage and scribbles, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people more physically attentive.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hoard around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored easier than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala for boredom susceptibility".
On the scale are statements like “Many things I have to do are repeating and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything”.
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys become boring more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of teens were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were out of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is certain that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their daily routine.
So back to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are studying the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been exploring the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you’re bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cook it, you’ll be happy.
But television can provide feelings of happiness in the short term, but these disappear in the long term.
If you give your bored child an iPad, it can take him away from boredom, but he has not learned to talk or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control is transferred from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from the constant sprinkling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to shut down and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it’s hard to get busy once the noise is muted.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and football player, is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a misdemeanor that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of fewer marijuana bouquets and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving a car in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils — cavalry offenses, each with a $100 penalty — and received a court appointment.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug offenses depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of legal violations revolving around marijuana have already been dropped here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent. This will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative districts have announced they will continue to track existing marijuana offenses and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are awaiting guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013 in mind.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, and thus also forms the end point of a gray zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how to agree on the state's requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On Nov. 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora employees stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21, and that the police would “immediately” not pursue criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce urban regulations regulating medical marijuana growers and continue to prosecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to prosecute cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people must be held accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were crimes at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
Reactions are mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer report adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana consumption with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state brought to light a profound quarrel among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants in court for marijuana offenses and acts on-site as a spokesperson for the National Marijuana Reform Organization.
“They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for being unable to accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national examples of drug legalization.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an era of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give in.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of medical marijuana consumers and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officers are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local community administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban, likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said City Council member Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We are guided by what the community has decided, not by what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
It’s not just university students today who are attacked for their views.
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and older brother had attended that university, which I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my arrival at Worscester College at the end of the eighties – where I had planned to study history – I had packed my bags again, bringing about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously declared that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, it ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been bullied for one reason – one reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a proponent of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate right-wing students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same equal rights protection that benefits gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They are calling for a seat on their college’s Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It featured, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University’s Conservative Student Association, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and sparred in a silver-coloured suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are seen as “sin heaps for the introduction of higher tuition fees.”
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservative Student Association, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the plea for greater protection, believes such a climate is “unpleasant.” 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has observed a growing rejection of moderate right students among JCR members.
“This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members,” she says.
In my first weeks at Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first-semester week, when new students got to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what would happen in the future.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with joy.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wooden-paneled rooms of the tutoring.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English, but I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (who has since passed away), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite ugly.
“Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes there were tears.
“I suggest that they take a few French hours in their spare time – so if you’re not too busy with your social activities,” Pitt grumbled at me.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college at dinner, when someone gently tipped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters claim to be supporters of the Labour Party.
At a local pub, I tried to dress up later.
I insisted that I did not agree on all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
An undergraduate in philosophy, politics, and economics who had ironically attended Eton College, which is considered to be conservative, told me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me stretched before my spiritual eye into a purgatory of rejection and isolation.
The only tutor to openly acknowledge himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist perspective of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said quietly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower tops.
Even my communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His damp eyes were clouded.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being teased.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had given up on the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly collapsed in shame, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “old fools.”
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who punched the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my harasser gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You're welcome to call me a weeping slut.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses have been compiled, created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion designer in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility doesn’t have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t kick off their tilts on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charism of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one recognized and felt his influence.
"All guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began its career at the Haute Couture Week 1995 in Paris.
“He never gets out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre long catwalk that proposes a role change: the user takes the model's place and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy owns for her wedding with Aristotle's Mona Lisa, the "Keep the Wool" of Mona Lisa, the Woolly.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” the former Duchess of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was living in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care" because "a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazzes" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half-meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, cumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
“He was immaculate; time leaves no trace on him.”
This is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur along the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who make a living by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilograms in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the rugged stone paths.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent at turtle pace, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip out and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed down the slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur they mine.
Arriving at the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresomely heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They then sell it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocent) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we usually carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each track he needs three hours, after which he is completely managed, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
But what looks like a miserable reward for such an almost inhuman effort is three times what he would earn from fieldwork.
"The daily salary of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees a day, and the work was not that hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I converted a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left its first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o’clock because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that the guardians of this nature park demand, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrycot.
"This work is for the animals and not for man," protests Madrusin, a stubborn 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the mineworkers jam into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which are shaped by the weight of the bait.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, with some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the elder at the age of 30 also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time goes by, but the poverty continues generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human burdens on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on the career, stress, and cost of real estate and parenting.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but nonetheless — or precisely because of that — they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper's song, which local sayings such as "Pushing a "bao" (laib) into the furnace to make fun of Singapore's low birth rate.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, keeps the hope that the commercial reaches in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to breeding, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this was an issue we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating nights (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why not do something as creatively as possible to tackle this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But so far, everything has had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that rate was above 2 – which is also known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why aren’t Singaporeans getting kids anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the national population authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people, apart from getting married and forming a family, to have significantly more choices in terms of life goals and setting priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and the delay in marriage and births, resulting in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract population decline has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore’s ruling party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Agency for Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they will discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer directions, which had previously been placed in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will not have a big impact.
“People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why many are pushing it out,” says one young manager.
The children can get others.
“It’s important to me to have my own money and time,” says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of ownership and education as reasons that they can’t have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – there’s still so much the government can do.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any type of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the importance of “private” on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or images of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t of me, or of someone making the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos of nudes, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone is answering me, I’m just uploading them,” he adds.
"The social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
After indicating the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone oppresses me or asks me, I’ll just remove them from my user account,” he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experiences that are known today as cyberbullying are not unknown to the boy.
A friend’s friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He only did it privately.”
Afterwards, he explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or if I want to wipe one out of him.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academician Marc Prensky, holder of a master’s degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work “Digital Natives and Immigrants” formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and adolescents who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we still learn ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, “because we require them to have a defined criterion about what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it.”
“They should also be picky when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is, is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then outlines some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of yourself, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you asked other people for permission before if you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you’re doing at any given moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, age, or what to share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not speak to strangers".
Conclusion of the Summit of the Unasur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically to be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the Chancellery of State and President initially said that they would hand it over after the exam, but later stated that it would be published on the website of the Peruvian government at some time.
When asked about the text, they said that the contents were explained by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The little information circulating among the journalists was received by the press representatives of some of the UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press officer.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail to the media with the "concluding statement" of the summit, but it was the Humala declaration and not the official document at the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a press appeal, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not published.
The official website of ASPA confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were in place, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague resolving a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we presently bring to this international court," Humala said.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, makes agreements, and submits to international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered a serious mistake.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from UNASUR since the ousting of its president Fernando Lugo in 2011, did not attend the meeting.
President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The head of state read the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for an investment amount of a total of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that UNASUR countries will “take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we extend the decisions on residency rights.”
He said action would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our output and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to prioritize a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America, and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read-out statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, lying on the transverse axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its re-establishment in the Union of South American Nations," he said.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting in Mexico on Saturday with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
“Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
“We will review all of these paths – they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary,” he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the takeover of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is the temporary chair of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America actually being able to learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "today are practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating South American citizenship, which the member states of the Unasur promote.
“The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign the South Americans.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been “substantiated assumptions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his proceedings would not be followed.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which had demanded that he be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sex offense, while “Swedish jurisprudence allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental state would be impaired.
"Since he was in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," the Ecuadorian president said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“This would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was to grant a free letter allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, and he underscored that there had been talks with London to find a solution to the reasons for WikiLeak’s imprisonment.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a number of proceedings on various European bodies,” he said.
“If Britain grants this letter tomorrow, I think it’s done.”
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as allowed by Swedish jurisdiction and done in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie that distorts freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and blackmail for profit,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and neither by the bankers nor by hegemonic and bourgeois countries", and anticipated that in a re-election he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain tough and not allow any opportunism and no coup d'état disguised as legally" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and according to the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not implemented.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look ahead.
He also relied on a good conclusion of disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court, saying that “it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries commit to accepting the verdict, even if it is very hard.”
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate in a row, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one that guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
“That’s decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
“In no case does it mean a relapse in President Chávez’s state of health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of dying from AIDS today is a too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the test result: HIV-positive.
“It was as if a bomb was hit,” he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor was “trying to weaken” without discernible success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to find out about it; and this with such commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye “because it led to a dead end.”
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who are unaware of their disease and in whom the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," explained the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was scientifically considered in April of this year.
Infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that although AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that those greater chances of a CD count of 200 years are not drug-dependent: up to 30.
Simply put, the above statements mean that if you are diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25, you can “have no problem reaching 75 years of age as long as you are under control,” this expert explained.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is still true that 60 percent of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year there were already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no supply problems with the medications. The problem is that people come into a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all those who need it must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the professionals and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, and this for the sole reason that it had even made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was a common turcoma and phase of AIDS.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, only his parents know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
“I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the global AIDS Day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the desk
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
“The distribution of condoms was actually increased in the places designated for this purpose; formerly they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Among those at risk for new infections are young people.
"Why do you need this?" is a common mockery question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system that young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the desk, but in dispensers in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity,” he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally ranked 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur through intercourse, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for every registered case.
After the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a ruling not recognizing the restructuring of Vitro Group’s liabilities reached through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is set for any national company with offices in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the land of stars and stripes in contradiction to international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the verdict by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Northern District Court in Texas causes Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals first says that the main proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, using the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the companies’ votes, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate that the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this option is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among the group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation since 2008 as part of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave blows to the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family lodges an objection before the same Court of Appeal in order for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States, will be filed.
What is serious about this case is that the court set aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), describing the procedure conducted by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, and pointing out that it had strictly adhered to the United States’ signed agreements in accordance with Chapter 15 of the Contradiction.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: a hit for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the accusations by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots Trade Unions) has finally made progress.
The petition, led by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of impeding the judiciary.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic’s headquarters of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the bank’s trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE in the name Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is Surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Caribbean University forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental establishment, which partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government did not comply with a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been filed according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it viewed them as a violation of free expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without impairing short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching stock market certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issuance is the first of four equal issuances that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competitiveval
Formed by the leading information technology companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, a group of companies was founded under the name Competitiveval, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment is over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball globetrotter, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was wheelchair bound by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was a part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, proxy and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
“I have put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with his faithful wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I’ve enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed one championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
He was granted the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze if it wasn’t for this Canadian referee who made us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won at the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the Pan American Games team in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the U.S. team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz) back in that team, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great joy, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter as a substitute for the locked players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family news release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He pleased everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, including The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the adorably despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who Shot J.R.?”, which was supposed to create anticipation for an episode full of emotions where Hagmann’s character was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a record viewership at the time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) instructed.
"I know what's on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn’t win.
Victoria Principal, the co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a “huge personality on and off the screen.”
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world, and it keeps us in our hearts who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TV channel TNT.
Recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian town of Malibu, where many celebrities are based.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I believed would harm someone or affect them in any way,” the Associated Press said.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxious patients.
“I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and thereafter,” he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "don't be afraid, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charme had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called a “Deudarmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charme told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone were to analyze what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, it would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Every week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a fellow professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We don’t take 2012, so we always keep the option to hold the course again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "ancient demise", students must study, create projects, and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than to continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end, Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still places available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of consolation or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a class where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed — let alone a professor — said they believed in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Maya, and in a certain way we discredited them,” said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has increased this speculation.
“People don’t think that way elsewhere,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of by the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21st, “people immediately think of a new date” or philosophize that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
