What will happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
CSSD's new elected officials in the capital's city hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the city council level with their old and new SDG colleagues.
The daily newspaper Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argument that was born in the last years in the city hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it has been discovered that the newly elected members do not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a faster in Prague politics reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected culture to the test of the vocabulary of the "Godfather".
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"This is the only expression you propose to me that I use."
Otherwise, I'm not using the argot.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, the editorial board chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the Prague City Hall.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the patisserie, "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "encumber".
Three of the elected officials agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who is to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has flatly refused the test.
"I don't care at all about these things and how the representatives of citizen democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently working on how we will understand each other in our programs," he said.
As has already been heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that he is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"This is the Blanka Tunnel," Kaucky said, adding immediately, "But I know it from the newspapers."
“I’ll have to pay for a language course,” he joked.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to the pastry".
"It's, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests there is no lexicon of argument in social democracy.
“I’ve consulted with colleagues and it seems we really don’t have anything like that.”
“Instead, we say names, sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
“I was called Briza at school but I don’t know if my colleagues call me that,” says Karel Brezina about the nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
Elect Weinert is either a Grandpa to Party members or the least friendly Little Old Man, Representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little jewel".
The nicknames are also the only ones that Social Democrats admit to using within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in baton law" it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his degree of doctor of law JUDr. at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches", a brochure has been published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man very rarely has this fate.”
"Young women in good health are also not judged because they participate in work and give birth to children," said a sister who is working in the capital of the West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” Die Standard warned of the drawback of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Burkina Faso’s neighboring Ghana, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil that is used for ritual anointings has ignited at the contact of the woman.
The oil blew up, it seems, when the team wanted to "hun the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human spirit-eaters have always posed a danger,” he says.
As Burkina Faso strives to curtail witch hunting, the Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad witch hunt that, it seems, participated in his death and would have been endeavoured by black magic to also kill the President."
“Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, randomly chosen men and women in villages in the Gambia,” Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
About a thousand people were released under international pressure.
Bakal's tenant: The poeles are warming, he has signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man walked out the door of the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying under his arm a file with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and that of his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 apartment of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there's no hot water and the heating works on solid fuel," the man with the signing power shows on his son's new contract.
"But I signed anyway," he explains to angry and half resigned.
The citizens' association of apartments BytyOKD.cz, which described the renting conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a leaflet will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" by frowning.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory for deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason Aktualne.cz has decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Right next to the door stands a guard of a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You do not have time to read your number "157" as your number already starts to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere else - requests for repairs, insurance events and the like.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving mails with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The new rentals special counter has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still a trial," the employee behind the counter responds after a moment of hesitation when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Derailment and the old apartments of Bakal miners are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament and from the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the social democrats reported this fairly consistently before the elections and it now fills the local newspapers.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a plank put in the toilet, the man mentioned is relieved in introduction.
However, it is mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a discount of half the amount of the rent that will be received by other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" counter on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
“Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent,” the employee told the counter.
And yet RPG porpos both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will decide.
“It’s not about threats, it’s just about informing you about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
“No one will go to court here,” one of Byty’s RPG employees thinks, and the man on the street in front of the customer center is right.
“I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
“Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people are waiting,” she said.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the fund for housing," says Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the fund for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with rents in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to make 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling in front of the upholstered chairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no fewer than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments.
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per m2 per month," the screen reads.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices that included the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that it also houses a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colorful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch. design employees have been able to visit.
The company of projects-architectonic Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini business kindergarten from the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employed about 90 people, mostly of child-bearing age, and it was important to her that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
At the same time as reduced-time work contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
This gives builders and architects the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (to the tune of 2.8 mil.CZK). They were able to buy equipment and equipment and after two years ensure a qualified staff as well as the start-up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The preparation of the project took a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped to make the request for staffing.
Childcare is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over three for the most part.
As it is a "mini kindergarten" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without looking at the hierarchical position.
Although it is about individual care and education, the mini kindergarten program is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children do not only play there but quality teaching is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and not have the stress of a delay in picking up the children at a school far from the parents' workplace.
Parents use their time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi’s interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric Saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic shapes, the house received the nickname Bone House from locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, are all ypical for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought precisely.
At night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of bright colors is reinforced.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood in waves copies the window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the doors, the eyelet and the slats.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district on the Passeig de Gracia shopping street at number 43, was born from the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction took place over two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on demolition of the old construction and construction of another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-family home was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade were born.
For the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the House of Bones".
Others, given the specific mechanism of opening the windows, have called it "the house that gives way".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its time of central heating, with vents and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems weird.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect the building directives of then and did not let himself be hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction it obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and asked for changes.
For example, the city council members did not like the fact that the pillars of the construction work on the public sidewalk.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's call, Josep Battlo asked for (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or else limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has received away from new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with skylights.
The two-color play gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house which was inscribed in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous designer.
They continued the tours as they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the field of tours to common areas and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price for Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a bedside: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for bedtime, so the mattress and bedside give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive,:weight, height, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the bedside table will be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where one does not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not suitable because they "warm up" gently.
In addition, they have a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not also have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
Habit is also crucial in choice.
Those who spend the clearing of time abroad where very thick mattresses with a creeping layer are frequently used, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all the hokey players who come back from NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
“For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a rammollising layer of lazy foam.”
“Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore misunderstand “information” from joints and skin,” explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything is going well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example appropriate mattresses.
You don't have to be an NHL guy to be able to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won’t turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You just sleep better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squares.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, i.e. about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm, or a total of 180 cm.
For single-seat beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly bent. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Maseratiers and decorators that has been dedicated for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a two-seater bed each needs its own bedside and mattress, so be careful however during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the frame to different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of this count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
"When touching or sitting on the mattress you don't have to feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of bedside.
The bedside, when the mattress and the bedside are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night one normally sweats from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this reason, specialists refuse to claim a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But all to his but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a mattress of 120/140cm, renounce, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to manufacture zippered coatings for the whole set, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for the washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a bedside table?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board with ventilation holes (if there are none) and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position slatted mattresses with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more regular slats, 28 and above, where the slats are possible to double in the part of the bottom of the kidneys as well as rigidity.
For mattresses with several positions, do not take spring mattresses because it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special connection of the lamellae which makes it possible to press or even to tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have “shoulders as wide as their backs,” this is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses who for the "males" have begun to use a creeping area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or wafer frames with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure spreads in more points and dilutes the tension.
But of course, beware, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated with air) on good mattresses and bedside, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which the Scandinavians for example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow should level (with the shoulder cradle of the bedside or the rammolly area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones based on straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also towards organic mattresses.
The petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While the birch plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract speeds up blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disrupted cellular structure so more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of the cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex came in first place.
Saving for the mattress and bedside is not easy.
One may from time to time have in the framework of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example the company Magniflex which offers Duofreze mattresses with Memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
The second can be taken for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
It started as matter for NASA because astronauts were undergoing huge load factors when starting up.
The Tempur creeps into the heat and hardens, on the contrary, into the cold.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this reason against poor sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
Czech manufacturers use for example EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as for example that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a match box but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage, but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The children's psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to carry something of this kind on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the little ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long waits,” says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very questionable.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Currently, it’s the phone.”
“As soon as tracing equipment develops, they (criminals) will look for it as well because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help in an unprepared assault by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracing services for both cars and people, having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an assault.
"The apparatus may be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period."
“In the event that the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned.”
“More expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is lying down without moving,” says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart cell phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special software.
The problem with current tracing systems is that it is either a device similar to those that are worn on a pendant the size of a match box or to smaller telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that’s why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as for tracing cars.
It is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the service life of the ropes is two to four years maximum.
The military has bought detonating cords from the STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general staff gave as reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosives exercise each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, Commander of the Army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army's reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is enough to have a maximum of 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has ensured - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited because of the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't take my head if they buy from us such a large amount of detonating cords."
“And it’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the military is a good customer that we as merchants strive to satisfy,” said STV Group Chief Commercial Officer Jan Decky.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejsek argues the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of the detonating cords and pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the depots, it can even go up to four years," says one of the two who does not want his name to be published in view of the army's criticism.
The life span passed, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The ministry's other argument is a rebate due to the amount of 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the opinion of the Ministry of Defence buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the necessary amount of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifespan.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnics and in order to be able to obtain more flexibly more modern and reliable types of detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading for the Rhine.
What awaits this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted in a few years: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap".
To this day, I am taking advantage of the contacts I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the contest for the best Individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of last year’s Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in his third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The ratio of quality to price of accommodation in our area made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building which he converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his activity as an entrepreneur has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until very recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another one of the same quality happened to him.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates showed up,” the number one contractor said last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," Pytloun adds with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very pleasant,” he recalls.
He recommends participation in this contest to anyone who strives to do something.
There is no need to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have otherwise obtained.
“With those I met through the contest, I started to have regular business relationships.
According to him, the fame related to success has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I observe in them above all the loyalty and pride of having committed themselves to something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the winner's sense of purpose Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to Slovansky dum for the first place in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition last year is Karel Zdarsky, the owner of Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award has not only encouraged me and my employees and increased our self-confidence to fight the competition," said last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky’s father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the communists confiscated the property, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father’s entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success obtained in the competition through the media.
“Not only did our customers really get to know the Farmet brand but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that had the greatest success in its home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year has not only been spent in Farmet in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"Obviously we have not escaped this situation."
“The turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that unpopular action is needed from time to time.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
At Farmet, however, they continued uncompromisingly investing in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with the grants, strengthened the company's presentation in international exhibitions and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of Affires go up and with them the number of employees as well.
"To the new winner I wish that pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes senseless regulations.
The Inquiry into the Absurdity of the Year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations may have been removed.
This year's little-glorious winner of the Absurdity of the Year survey has been the obligation to bring into the offices documents that public servants can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the Social Affairs Administration requested a paper excerpt from the trade register, whereas the grievor can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract from the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Bringing out all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and having those that are absurd removed is the meaning of this contest of the absurdity of the year.
This investigation is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters demonstrated, it was at least 4,000 this year who brought their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only slow down the company, and,this, more and more.
"Perhaps we are among the number of documents to fill out for tax returns in the top places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is in 74th place in terms of conditions for the company, 8 more places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first set up in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for "the anti-prize" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until the last investigation last year, a hundred, or more accurately, 105 regulations and decrees have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees is for example the obligation that motorway and highway maintenance vehicles pay the tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The proclamation of the competition, which always begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a happening in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts batons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to delete, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a swordshot in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days in advance at the office for the individual company at the location of the company, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most popular requirement in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a 30-day service trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by an order from the Ministry of Health last year—the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or even sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies that monitor their company's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible business," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodaphone, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the competition of the company of the year 2010, organized by the company Vodaphone, have registered companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns people with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the example of the Prague software company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old Podebrad paper mill, which employs more than 70 per cent of the employees with health problems, was awarded the title of Head of the Central Bohemian Region and placed third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, won for introducing relaxed working hours and even decreased to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also awarded it the title because it is primarily interested in Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyen activity in the surrounding area and is concerned with the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business and administration has the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work from home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the company's representative.
At the very last rank is, also for its activities, a Washing and Cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, increasing qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal construction company Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesia region.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company category, who had completed the enclosed questionnaire for registration and sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
Poorly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the company Responsible but were not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodaphone Firm of the Year."
"Independent entries are not possible because this is a sub-category of the Firm of the Year main competition," said Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handed the handcuffs to the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos.
The latter had attempted to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a request for restitution in such a way that the proposed land would be obtained by a particular candidate.
He was to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider criminality as part of a public tender and competition," the head of the Plzen Prosecutor's Office, Antonie Zelena, told the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations as the investigation is ongoing.
Police released the 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how he could influence a public competition, one can only speculate on the basis of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokeswoman of the Lubomira Cerna Lands Fund said that the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
“It was a customer and in no case an employee,” she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has the real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is set up when several beneficiary candidates manifest themselves.
"These individuals propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a ranking of the buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," said the Fund's spokesman.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered for the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary because, having purchased a large number of restitution rights, he had proposed to the candidates on the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards at the FdT (Terrain Fund).
It was included in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a building had already been edited.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the access road to the industrial zone of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction in jeopardy by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional 100 kronor per month for housing.
Starting in January, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
As of January, families will have to pull out of their wallets up to a hundred crowns a month more than they do now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more for the supply of water and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be close to 100 kroner per annum for households in apartments.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energies, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
One can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest communes that are planning to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 kronor more per month, families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 kronor annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 percent increase for water and sanitation for the event that the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the Prague will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising by 7.4 percent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450,000 apartments for rent from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided on an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be brought to court by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from the parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who get drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are no exception.
This is the result of the experience of physicians encountering cases similar to admissions in the children's departments of hospitals.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
"The trend is really towards strong alcohols," says Ludek Pelikan, head of the children's department at the Horovice hospital in Central Bohemia.
“When they manage to chip a bottle of dad in the closet, it’s sometimes about whiskey but it’s fernet and vodka that predominate.”
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, a spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, said she was right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
“It’s alcohol in fashion today, especially in elementary schools.”
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought home from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the head of the Pélikan department, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 years old at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he practiced for ten years in pediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
A girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought in with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem weird to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours,” the department director said in a statement.
It is the disinterestedness of parents or their extraordinary tolerance in the face of the fact that their offspring indulge in drinking that are the main cause of the development of alcoholism in children.
According to specialists, however, we do not talk about addiction, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the term alcoholic we mean a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that we do not find in children."
"For those who use repetitive acool, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," explained the head of department Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with a crave intoxication requiring hospitalization are integrated into the statistics.
Drunken children who are after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pélikan, there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: Witch's Day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after poor results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I experienced the Witch's Day admission of seven drunken children at once," Pelikan said.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in medically controlled detoxification is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffered the day after the "hangover".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a sweet awakening and nothing hurts them."
“They’re just astonished at where they are,” Pelikan adds, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ good mood at least with the bill to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
“Once in a while, I have applied this as a means of education by counting to these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend the whole summer on seasonal work to pay for a single night,” Pelikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive managements, which should recover from parents the burdens related to care, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 aircraft of the five in all, for which the Ministry of Defense exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is based.
This is the first time that aircraft of this type have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were until now in service in the Czech Army and were in a flying state.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody's planes is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seater aircraft planned for the exchange were taken on long-stored aircraft without causing additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The two-seater L-159 T1 has been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
In May 2009, the ministry signed an agreement with Aéro Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the conversion of four unused L-159 cars into two.
The military took delivery of the first aircraft in July, with the second scheduled for delivery later this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
“The contract clearly states that the one taking into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who considers how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not launch a tender and contacted EADS directly.
At the time, the defence management argued that the exchange ensures future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought from Aero Vodochody 72 aircraft and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence with the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of a European-wide tender and in no case directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
Longer index than annular index is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that relative finger length serves as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under the age of 60," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo the prostate cancer test, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index finger shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular the risk however fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60 the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is covered in snow this Thursday morning.
On roads and sidewalks, there is mostly compact snow, clearers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93rd kilometres in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 highway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile Club Central (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometre a truck was accidented, in the 93rd two heavy vehicles hit each other, the accident injured some.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit there.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometre in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers formed at this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
There are queues of cars in Prosek for example, Sterboholska street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed for example on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff must meet again.
The railways and the airport are also experiencing problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to eliminate because of the snow 7 rapids links.
For example, the lines from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Wednesday 11am in the night until 5am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko chains are mandatory to pass certain communication routes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snow removers and snow cutters.
At the moment we cannot estimate when they will be rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is of rigour in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snowfall is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the code name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate gun
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive breaking, in fact functions as small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel chips falls on it, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses “smart” technology.
"The soldier essentially uses it in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of sight, according to which he corrects his site sighting and presses on the trigger.
"Let's say you've targeted at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 relocated jobs
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located in the office building on Mareinbader Square in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant specialized in the manufacture and maintenance of computers said on Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far in the Marienbader square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu said that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-air offices at Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us.”
He says that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Frankfurt City Council’s head of economic affairs, Markus Frank (CDU), said once again that a “global player” had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important momentum for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
At an early stage, management informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer facing the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of preventing such an exceptional place from being unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the City Hall Square building, previously used by the Fujitsu company and the neighboring "small vertical" as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, were part of the controversial spa construction project.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hall, which aroused a lot of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be partly parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advisory firm Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-based specialty group Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund, and a year later these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, considers itself the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name is reminiscent of its star-shaped design, is home to, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is facing more and more problems.
Internet service provider Amazon has expelled the site that specializes in revealing confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may hide political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
WikiLeaks founder Mr. Assange is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the WikiLeaks website is being attacked with ever greater force.
The cyber-activist group "WikiLeaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, eminent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is likely staying in Britain, according to reports published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," the cyber-activists behind the revelations said Wednesday via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
After the release of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of accesses to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for the people in Europe.”
When free speech poses a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, citing Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned WikiLeaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Territorial Protection had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to take this step sooner in light of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information,” he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of the servers by the platform.
“WikiLeaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and endangering lives all over the world,” the statement said.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of stolen documents.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described as intrigues orchestrated by his critics the lawsuits brought against him by Sweden.
WikiLeaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee has demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser told television, obviously ironically, that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the claims of a website."
The US government is now fully testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Russell Travers, deputy director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed as the official to fight the leaks.
Travers is in charge of putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to take care of the security of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by WikiLeaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The University of the Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice cream confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated showcase using a spatula, disposes it into the waffle and then starts selling it.
To know, one does not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbet maker founded the University of Ice in 2003 so that the ice creams released from its machines everywhere meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day introductory course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice cream, which spans several days, and hands-on sessions are held in the private ice-cream shop.
In the midst of the crisis of their forties, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk fulfilling their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia and Hungary.
Jacky, an art education teacher from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product to the industrial ice cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and, after a few years, she wants to draw something unique from this nerve-wracking profession.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
Determining not only the good taste, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "Italian ice cream is simply the best: and then it still retains a fair dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: he takes out a white cream of pasteurized base, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately beset with the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano cautions against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who only talks about ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will not chew anything but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery shelf of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will all try to refill you with dozens of flavored ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Either in ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and forms, when added cocoa powder, the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course have to move to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purees: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of walnuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of an ice cream," says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (winners use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the calculations easier.
The production of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as in the past.
It is not only the automatic base mass making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it creamy and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo brushes with fruit puree from head to toe and, thus, splashes his schoolmates when control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur in each class: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an Ambiguous Position
According to some sources, the industry that experiments with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve been well informed,” Christoph Then, the director of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
Some reports indicate that the chairman of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby group.
It is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of EFSA's test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The provisions elaborated correspond, in paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi lobby and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities established in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior EFSA official has recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, She has changed sides.
Not long ago, even the Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union control authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicion from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, EFSA does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as it is of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of EFSA are not prohibited from establishing contacts with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi, based in the United States.
This body sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts from, among others, science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobbyist.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impacts of genetically modified maize are causing the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
“If we don’t look for risks, how can we discover them?” asks Mr. Then in an accusatory tone.
This is also the view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not related to societies.
In the company's view, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls security research."
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell took care of it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manoeuvre.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: By September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billions.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in a halt to construction work.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the shell limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
Some fragments have been obtained.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and inexpensive rock, simple and terrestrial."
He claimed that by cutting it by saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
traces of the Stuttgart stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tübingen, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappeared in the landfill,” he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was subjected to insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to keep using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took away one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing on average 80 kilos, whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir in while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half are still piled up in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long since become "Mäuerle" or limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," Rongen said.
"was this political component."
He gets into his all-terrain car, tours his vast 20-hectare empire.
He did law studies which he dropped out and later undertook to study biology before becoming interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
He accumulates treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's holding back.
Sandstones sculpted with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of fingers: red sandstone, previously part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin. "
The parallelepiped was once part of the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the travertine of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the reddish granite from the cathedral of St. Blasien, the tuff from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and carts pulled by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
“It would be a scandal if such a heritage were to be dismantled.”
He did not become rich, much less rich.
But today this carrier employs 14 people, and stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon, he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Struggle for talents to conquer high potentials
The counter is very busy.
16 students are rushing to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea competition, they have to talk business about the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, by the way, know the Volkswagen company.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go hand in hand in the competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive in the job market and they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify outstanding talents in practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group loves the talents.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group enclosure.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal benefits for both parties: "Students get in touch with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into consideration as a collaborator.”
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
“In the past, the focus was on the professional project,” says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In industry goods, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a host of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and above all court the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering degrees who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum relating to the positions of engineer will increase further.
Roman Dykta goes on a talent hunt for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a sort of paper rally where competitors have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG subsidiaries and get to know the company.
Participants must decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to search for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until today, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct amalgamation carried out on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a quite conventional way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
“For example, at the solar technology show,” says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of succession.
Currently, 35 positions are contested on the company's website.
"At the moment it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example the University of Fribourg.
"Professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to undertake professional internships or write his or her graduation project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are being announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
“Often, a large group can’t do that,” says Stübe, chief of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played the leading role in job search.
Other determinants are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honours table for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and its context while looking at the framework conditions of the employees.
The head of staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the company's image among job seekers.
“I think candidates rely primarily on external assessments when it comes to a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means first and foremost taking internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through its own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied collaborators make the best messengers."
When they treat their employees well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” Kriegler said.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida in the southeastern United States in the coming years.
The Washington government has issued an equivalent ban and thus definitively overturned its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains banned for the time being.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April is behind this strict ban, which is expected to remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating tide in golf has not, to this day, been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces billions in claims for compensation, is at the center of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze on the drilling site after the platform exploded.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security guidelines, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing extensive reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced they would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector now publicly warn that the flow of feed in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to a current survey conducted in the sector by the audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban pronounced Wednesday.
In fact, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is oiled brown; it gives off a odor similar to the one that exists in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of liters of crude oil destroyed Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Humans live on theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the environmental activist told reporters to calm them down: “You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has attempted to photograph a young man plunged into muddy water to the chest, as well as the greasy trail that surrounds him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the radiance of water in the color of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom recounts that she once collected shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil erupted from an oil pipeline that exploded into the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the small nearby town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fishy waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the devastation is evident when you walk through the mangrove swamps crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat splits crading brown water, and anyone who dips his hand into it removes it all covered with oil.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like licorice sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly leave their palms hanging.
We search in vain for clouds of birds, as we usually encounter them in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of yesteryear that resembles a gas station by the smell it gives off.
"What is happening here is war against the environment," says Celestine Akpobari with a sad look: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The area where the Ogoni live is a besieged battlefield for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers penetrated here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because these were very dangerous.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines in the entire Delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are untapped, because the petroleum situation there is too low.
Every few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trenches like bizarre sculptures: The heads of drill holes are very affectionately designated "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are eaten up by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari estimates that a drillhead of this nature breaks from time to time as a steady stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts’ estimates, more than two billion litres have poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that flowed into the sea during the crash of the super-oil tanker “Exxon Valdez” 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history.
Who should be responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For Shell, pipeline sabotage and siphoning are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, while environmentalists consider drillhead explosions and perforated pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, US researcher Richard Steiner accused the Shell group of applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "even higher than allies".
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of cockroaches and installed in the open: They are completely naked and covered in cockroaches up to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motif on the site must be spotted: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then at the end of the pipe the kerosene drops fall and finally diesel is obtained.
For example, Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a ridiculously low price of just 40 cents per litre of diesel: because they buy their raw material for free.
According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: The networks of organized crime, which also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, load the lion’s share in tankers and blast it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute environmental catastrophe or rather subversive activities to the population or to the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni’s relations with Shell especially have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal of the group. “maybe operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better.”
Then Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time you went out of your way,” the rugged oil worker announces.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers, mainly from the north of the country, want to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
“In all respects, this damn thing has brought our country down very low,” Akpori said.
Investigators Discover Construction Defects in A380 Reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major safety issue.
In examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had visibly had so far more luck: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian aviation safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft had a serious safety problem, and it cautions against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipe, according to a statement published Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a “catastrophic reactor failure.”
These are the reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4 in Singapore, is among these.
The Australian airline has now filed lawsuits against the British manufacturer of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas’ director, Alan Joyce, said his company would seek damages in connection with the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is causing the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety-related tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be significant enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of an A380.
The two-story aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall across the country causes transport chaos
All of Germany covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the entire country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is raging in Germany: With freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked on a permanent basis, but they could not cope with the snow that was accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather alert center Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were trapped there overnight.
Even in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfall hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutsche Bahn, severe disruptions to rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, fallen trees on railways, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport between Leipzig and Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the train’s 165 passengers with blankets, food and drink.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at Germany’s major airports.
According to a spokesperson for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport said that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service ensures a permanent service.
It is true that there are not many passengers stuck at the airport, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a barrel on a slippery road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: the snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could generate up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former location of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not state the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, “We’re checking whether it’s more interesting to own the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back for rent at a later date.”
Thus, Germany’s largest financial institution has already relinquished its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million euros from the holders of equity and then rehabilitated them.
Transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, engulfed around 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector of activity estimate the value of the towers, in the meantime renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is currently unclear whether the properties will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the deaths of minors.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the buried miners who have been declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been recovered because the safety situation of the damaged well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years of age were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disaster well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance of survival.
Until now, the bodies could not be recovered.
Today, relatives and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun at Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place.
The flags were placed in front of all the public buildings of the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative holiday that New Zealand has nourished hope that the miners would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pits, said he cannot resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the epic of the fighter.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators to wait for dead in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the blind man does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at the most, by the detour of one or two sentences some appalling screams of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland that is the setting of the Viking universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and for excellent travelings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is a pity that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy related to the fierce drug dealer and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema of art and essay.
Most supporters of art cinema must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads all around and to the intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom when the blind man boards, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a matter of dialogue in this film, nor of a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator cannot escape it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glacial images and a gloomy soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully by the side of the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by transforming himself into a warrior, is perhaps sent by the devil himself.
It represents decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, decayed.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at anger, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications about a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone submit to the agency's controls.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city located nearby is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is talking about the reactor that Syria built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing by U.S. intelligence services, the CIA, dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would be well-suited to produce plutonium, which would allow atomic weapons to be manufactured.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with fuzzy satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or even the inside of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is barely more information available than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery is getting deeper and deeper.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but had little evidence that the country was developing an “active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about it and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, saying the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrians certainly hastened to remove the rubble of the " unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the terrain.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in al-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a member state satellite images from commercial providers showing the moment directly following the attack; it appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always assured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built a reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it unlikely.
Since then, damas refuses any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection at the al-Kibar site and refuses access to the wreckage of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on it."
For example, the investigation into this case has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and is "increasingly becoming a serious credibility issue for the Agency", as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat serving at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately a serious violation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
The IAEA believes that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria denies access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear that the inspection group is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it was intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have shuttled between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could “serve for fuel production.”
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where should the uranium have come from and where would the plutonium needed to make the bomb later have been separated.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, was stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt have disappeared, no one will have information on where the rubble will be stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that in 1998 Syria had the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from al-Kibar, across the Euphrates River, examined to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to those sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it did not help to dismiss the suspicions.
It is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was intended to allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only the time invested shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means at the disposal of the Atomic Energy Agency to implement its controls.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but he is still hesitant.
This means carries a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to reflect: "Would it be useful, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in Time of War
It’s been going badly since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a love story between a Bosnian woman and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
There is a persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s federations immediately protested, and in response, some filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women's Victims of War organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she offered these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined that offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's script speaks volumes about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended that the UN High Commissioner remove Angelina Jolie's goodwill ambassadorship.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his screenplay, granted a filming permit to Sarajevo after some hesitation, but it is not known why it did not come later despite the permission.
The young author assures herself that she is not pursuing political objectives with her film, that it is by making a lot of effort that she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This is a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with his executioner".
That Jolie’s film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on erroneous information.”
Now, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, all is well with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy against the backdrop of loud music, they stutter with their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in southern Ireland vibrates because the players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls from a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre spectacle is called "beer-pong". The winner pockets 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to attend the World Beer-Pong Championship in January in Las Vegas.
Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and reserved computer scientist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the distressing question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not part of his plans, and in January he will lead interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I don't have a job there."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "within two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man with a smile.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner’s three sisters tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now holds a position as an IT consultant in London.
The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts come true, it will be an emigration flow comparable to that suffered in Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed great ease, grief now takes all the place.
The economic crisis, however, mainly affects the well-trained young Irish, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
Loss of jobs and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there was money in excess.
But in the meantime, three out of every ten people under the age of thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is drifting."
“There should be an uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but whoever has the chance, goes away, and so does our country for a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eyes and offers no prospects for the future for young people.
“They’re cutting minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
She sees her classmates clinging from one unpaid practical internship to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon is organising the "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers full support on the theme of "working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers to the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," he said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallantry, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house is emerging in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hanover and Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he takes part in an extra job, in order to complete the repayment of the loan contracted to build his home in the home country.
“The situation is already a bit crazy,” he says as he crosses the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I practically don’t live anymore.”
He bursts with an embarrassed laugh as he passes through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-groomed front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for 380,000 euros, funded 100 percent by the credit.
“It was moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid of seeing everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan pondered for a moment, scooped up some hot tea and said, "I don't have any kids to care for and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer does not like the lamentations he often hears lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, but our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he said.
“Working for a while abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe it’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there, and in Ireland, life just went on."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leaving the future and discovering how life goes elsewhere.
In his charts, he already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him well in recent days: the party to be organized on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye party.
“Just not a lot of emotions,” he says while drinking a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it seems worrying."
"Let's call it a goodbye night, relaxed, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from this year's survey results, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase from 25% in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America shook support for democracy.
If this has held up during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only experienced a brief recession and benefited from a sharp recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or a loved one have been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected a perfect general election in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the distressed country and plunged into fear.
There were ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballot papers scattered in the gutters, looted polling stations and intimidation.
The polling stations were open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced by the January earthquake, were wandering around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event to be "a pretty good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these serious irregularities necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is expected in January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal to have the vote declared void.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second round.
With an epidemic of cholera raging, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stakes are important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the center
In the weeks after she suddenly became a widow, Argentina's president Cristina Fernández enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points, to more than 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, visibly in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was accustomed to developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has plunged into dismay following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement in power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian hit one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more flexibility to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and union wage demands see this figure close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Ms. Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was boosted by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation eroded the growth boost following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Ms. Fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore financial relations between Argentina and the rest of the world.
This year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the minister of the economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; which looks like a prelude to the sanitation of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines have returned from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have rebounded.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, quietly, many of her husband's policies.
Half an hour for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother located across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters on November 27, or 70% of eligible voters, came forward to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments about the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, it failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which leaned toward Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including bustling campaign trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal outfits.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, KMT Honorary President, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an election impact by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to note that the question of the mainland itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from stoking anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable to Taiwan's economic survival.
Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but let’s start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was in trouble: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, like Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it too can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement released from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will find it difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT must make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been low; despite dizzying economic growth, KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson for the KMT said its cabinet and its local offices would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan’s support for the rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer picked by hand by President Obama to perform at her 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the Grammy Awards’ surprises this year with a wide-ranging nomination in the category of “Best New Artist.”
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains somewhat mysterious but is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given her slightly engaging vocal style, skillful hand of pop and funk, and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line at Spalding compared to Norah Jones's last-ditch success in 2003, the closest category for Grammy production voters in those years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Award voters have rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a turn on an invigorating thrill of a recording that was one of last year's prime favorites.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of New Orleans' raucous vocals and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognitions in the big ensemble category; competing with rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose live byte's "Pathways" album was a fine example of that bassist's democratic hand as a bandleader.
Nominated for Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
Classical nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards feature a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
Leading nominations include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto by Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also running for an award.
Classical nominations are spread over 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for classic producer of the year features five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the various"
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Avenue" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin's National and ChOr.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute work is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he aviat wrote the 15-minute work especially for mandolinist Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only soloist-vocalist nominees; these are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixes, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the planning commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public, often passionate, witnessing.
Critics have attacked the project by claiming that it promotes both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respects local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of that as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice wins."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very strong voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, with most of the time people speaking out for or against the centre, at approximately evenly distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no more America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet in height.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the city council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even if it's far from a truly 'foreign' life form," said Paul Davies C.W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacterium, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We wonder what’s still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, who co-authored the report.
The discovery is important when it comes to researching life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, Anbar says.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we deem absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances might be able to substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
“As a result, organisms have a hard time distinguishing these elements separately.”
“But arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work exactly like phosphorus; it gets inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she says, so researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed in the beginning,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs on four stolen from outside a Bellflower motel were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced Thursday.
The four show dogs — two Akitas and two Welsh Pembroke corgis — disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express pickup truck in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
“They are in good shape.”
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in what neighborhood and what the circumstances were of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas — Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female — were safe and sound, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach's "AKC/Eukanuba" national championship, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple’s nearly month-long canine exhibition tour.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to their bedroom window.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and corgis, in thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is unclear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start all over again.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Thursday officially praised the creditors’ “pre-packaged” plan that roughly $5 billion of debt would be erased; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and television shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover under the tutelage of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will become a lighter studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has entered into a $500 million credit facility to fund MGM's new operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which is hitting $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy the studio’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more that creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be redone as the MGM team had begun work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially leaves bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have raised $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a $4 million “success bonus.”
Barber and Birnbaum plans to revive the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", with Warner Bros.
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to fund its share of these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, has attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the top candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the iPad, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a major breach in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumping ropes, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three domestic toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
Clearly Moore's Law has evolved, this year's tech toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more deals.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on the stomach.
One pressure is equal to a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several of them, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-based games like Simon Says and can do lunar dancing thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complained of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It’s back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with game cards questionnaire designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve binder.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three standalone alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3-8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3-12 year olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3-7 year olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows family photos to be displayed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and over) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before time runs out, this is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online from Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 year olds) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child receives enough credit at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be roller skates or a toy pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button-stacked micro-robot.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to policing in China
Tang Shenbin roamed a city square as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve loads, issuing low-key orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan -- imposing officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence -- to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stay straight!"
"Be piercing!"
“Show them,” he said, “what the pretty girls look like!”
Four girls who had barely passed their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical olive-coloured jackets and trousers, were frozen at the guard.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned with the ruler.
Four neat hats perfectly perched on top of hair tied by a striped bow in blue and white.
“Personally, I think they look average,” Mr. Tang said, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city required all new recruits to have a higher education degree.
The province of Guangdong has traded the grey-green uniforms for a purportedly more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced lower-eyes with the strong way:: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by casting black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporteur packed up his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large imaging operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, shape and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have difficulty catching the eye of this underground urban brigade of China
And for good reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal ordinances by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei province beat an observer to death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a landfill.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and put online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game imbued with violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year, after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper called for a "true complete cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had real chores or if they were just tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and “five facial features in the right order.”
They should be larger than average, 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
Officers said the work was too physically distressing for women over the age of 25.
"It's their image that's important," one district officer told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are suitable; these are size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and “inner qualities.”
The women of Chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the features of the face.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, disabled or disfigured people do not have to apply.
“We can’t let a crippled person or a hump come to serve here,” Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheekbones with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
“Do you think I look sexy in that uniform?” she asked in a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old colleague with dimples, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their mandate being limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into the alleys where they are supposed to limit their business.
Each morning, the team confronts a dozen street vendors who travel quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before escaping.
"Master Wang, you must go."
“We’ve told you many times!” said Ms. Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle bike cart.
The officers describe their functions as rather monotonous than arduous.
“It’s pretty much the same every day,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies post-work marketing.
"Grande Routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property from sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after false rumors spread that chengguan agents killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police and chengguan agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were knocked down or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from placid Baoguang Square, where female officers were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle was screaming at scandal.
A 15-minute gunshot followed before the police, with their sinister face, made their way to their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men’s team, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 and older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not indict Senator Ensign
Attorneys for the Department of Justice have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign over a case involving a former campaign assistant and his efforts to get lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers said on Wednesday.
The ruling puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer being investigated and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice abstained from commenting on the matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, saying there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, obtain a lucrative lobbying job to gain silence from Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as Treasurer in a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with the documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator with Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the so-called lobbying revolving door ban.
“There appears to be prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and materially violate the revolving door law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge declined to explain the reasoning that led to the Ensign decision, Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks by its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop the prosecution of former Senator T. Steven's fault.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the general manager of citizens for accountability and ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's senior lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call Monday from a Justice Department prosecutor and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the ministry was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
“I’m not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that Mr. Ensign's parents' payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Home Office on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a luncheon with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth-ranking Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing in the distance in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent horrible testimonial reports every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the rape case trial and the children tied to their beds in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the trial widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official ending where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that outlines appeal arguments, likely to occupy the courts for years to come.
What is provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial – as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists – has created a “circus atmosphere,” a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been ill-influenced by the public’s passions.
The request could prompt appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms undermines human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the Superior State Court laconically dismissed the claims in the ruling last week, saying the media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that doesn’t seem to be the last word on the issue.
Courts of Appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage courtroom communications, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered prejudice when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical of prosecutors, and that he improperly pressed for a verdict by making the unusual decision to get the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was being discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to ignite the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily tumbling of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “didn’t resemble anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that snapshots were more incendiary than slower press releases was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court’s policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appellate courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they made reference to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction for media coverage of the trial and said they would invoke the need for new rules for new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring divisions closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as about recognizing their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the committee on the president’s deficit was just as civilized, despite the political divergences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap; but which, however, still divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voters' patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxation, spending, health care or rights, both parties are miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed in tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“This is inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade.
That's good."
On certain issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of it, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism lies on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done are, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed widespread skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what’s going on between now and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea voters who contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in early reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, pushing back the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the toughest tasks in Washington and, according to them, have imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the group's elected representatives, suggesting that there are, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise on tax issues.
Galston plans two phases in the battles between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes and health care, and then be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever will be judged as a loss will have to change course and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more substantial election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
US documents leaked describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and passes to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. Embassy in Russia said in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are conducting huge racketeering that helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Luchkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for the corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little clearing since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation lawsuits on those charges.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's thrown away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government, according to the embassy note.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term used in the criminal/mafia world which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor’s office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level.”
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report states that the FSB is robbing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the small ones.
One source, he said, “explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because not only do they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law.”
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high.”
The note notes that although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their business shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he has admitted that little progress has been made.
The note from the embassy conveys reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats,” said Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow’s Indem think tank, in a recent interview.
“But he’s part of that bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of a political class because there is none in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption are estimated to be more than $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent poll on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The release of the note from the US embassy, which was only made yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angrily to the remarks that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest with you, we didn’t suspect it would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School spoke about the man who built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader; and he cared about his people,” said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty to Anlong Veng is finally called into question.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led with the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentenced to 35 years in prison, the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
Faced with this development, anxiety has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans from Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the U.S. Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia’s border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements surrendered in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large Khmer Rouge fighter groups began defecting from the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have plunged into black misery, common to rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officers retained their positions of local leader in exchange for laying down arms, they were unskilled farmers at low rank and record.
“These people benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
“They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime.”
“They were raised in a setting where doing business is a foreign concept.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to provide for our own needs.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, early next year.
The court’s mandate is to try senior leaders and those responsible for the crimes, but it did not say whether it continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm fears at Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, a former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem was returning from work to the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is at peace and stable,” she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court sued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang of the documentation center.
“Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces,” he said.
“We need to put these pieces together so we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved handbook on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new handbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he says.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will sue.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful appeal here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads up to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone seller, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component for nuclear weapons, as part of a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world.
The deal was released in a joint statement after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and appeared to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarus research center.
This paved the way for a deal Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who raised the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton called the deal "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and weakly enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product ... We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with poorly enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Careful coordination and organization has been put in place to build trust," leading to Clinton's signed agreement, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy department official specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Centre, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remain essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not objected to CIA thefts.
The government has raised no objection to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners heading for Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by WikiLeaks' cable-filtered documents in the daily El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, which add that the first vice-president of the government at the time, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked for the Spanish executive to be informed to "demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign planes that were passing through Spain".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report accusing dozens of countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting was held between former U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised Zapatero's out-of-the-box government" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection regarding intelligence theft over Spanish territory.”
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "taking them off guard," Aguirre says in a cable.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, informed the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (NIC) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the embassy said after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information of CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "even though the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid the comments of a fiery rhetoric."
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," she said.
The parenticide that went to confession complained in network of the "abusively" of being a mother
The girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; both of them from Noia, the village of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl started a relationship in 1998 with Iván T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We found another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a fasting man from Lousame, a nearby municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little boy stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is said that their idyll has fractured, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Menorca, alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and upset that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed like a good thing, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If he doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I get home," she alleges.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'll only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to show up for a job so as not to lose it."
She explains that if everything was going well, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him of my life with another person if that person is not my mother,” he said.
In July, there is another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
"On one side he's with me and he likes this place a bit, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
“He’ll be there a few hours in the summer and that’s how I save some money from the babysitter.”
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, el goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's giving me some money."
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now stuck, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph) ".
The last man who lived with her, vigilante, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened so that she hadn’t told him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the Provincial Penitentiary of Palma yesterday, from the Judicial Detention Centre of Menorca.
The official lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts had gone, "and she also did not intend to harm the minor."
Before that, she had confessed that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats in Congress.
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and deputies registered in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the general because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these committees normally doubles that it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomous ones of 2006 they obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If we continue this upward trend, which is desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the retention of the electorate of the PP, the analysts of this formation calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four MPs (he now has 10) and PSC would lose neither more than 25 MPs.
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one member - it has three now - while ICV would keep one member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is maintained, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal committees, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority either the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its number of votes in all four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, <0xC3><0x80>ngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular ones have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan Cell Facilitates Thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the Barcelona Police Information General Police Station formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the deaths.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus and "therefore its operational capacity" has been "weakened".
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, may have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were integrating the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its “combatants” could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with complete impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, that is why in the investigations participated, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be similar coups in the following days as recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani detainees Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddic Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another one was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87><0xE1><0xB9>, and the Pakistani<0xE1><0xB9><0xE1><0xB9><0xE1><0xB9><0xE1><0xB9><0xE1><0xB9>.
They were the ones who headed the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a few miles of dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used afterwards by the integrators of the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The police have seized on a wealth of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are summarized as giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures as well as the national complicity.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of the nomination.
From a possible agreement with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an inauguration "all sovereignist and independenceist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to reduce the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the interim that he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the center's lawyer, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally exploited the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can not at any time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only a hint of recklessness on the part of any other person than the accused.”
The person already baptized as the "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the center's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and a cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of inmates, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or on the contrary he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12-17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB Threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet’s threat that “the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral differentials have closed to force and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by closes of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose his fear.
A month ago, the ECB cited us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary futures liquidity measures and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly unlimited access auction at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond-buying program will continue and even signal intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds and they collapsed the markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year milking auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only $500 million at 5.28% compared to $750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension ahead of the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we are all interpreting the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, double the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was swift and radical and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it resolves with strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than $40,000 million in liquidity available, triple that of March, at very expensive types and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, appearing."
Courage, we can get out of it!
The president of Eulen will challenge the advice of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no right", the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José grant their legal drums for the new chapter of their litigation for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to cede in his litigation to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who have appointed themselves directors in the meeting of shareholders of January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Register of Commerce and Companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder within the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the plaintiffs his five sons to try, through procedural arguing, clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18," according to his official spokesman.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the assembly takes place, it will be contested on the grounds that it is "null and void of right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group nevertheless requests usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application for challenge for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new team that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without detracting from the champion’s skill as a driver, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that powers his car, in the world of Formula 1 we speak of the legend of the “secret weapon” that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to transform him into a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far removed from high-level motor racing.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly lines of manufacturing plants from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 teams had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications on the trolleys.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's bolides except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can move from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological advancement is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolides in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this task has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull’s Formula One, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and notoriety zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago one could say that R&D progress in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to set up 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will count this initiative with the 16 zones already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the refurbished store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to establish 200 branded points of sale in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first openings were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, although she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems has assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold the same image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of businesses aims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, assistance, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves potential problems with HP’s computer equipment as a warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is designed specifically for MPEs and users, as the large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on ‘stealing’ one million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell’s managing director, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
Despite this, it anticipates a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increments in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011, which will last for three years.
The goal, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating by attracting one million new individual customers - 700,000 if we deduct those who can leave the bank -, its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the particular customer.
This year it captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same, on austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year his Optima master plan, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more fiscal year.
Customers who miss out on savings banks will be his main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a “difficult and transcendental” year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liabilities war - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and coffers pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
“The liquidity and financing aspect is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit.”
“We didn’t tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend now “is to increase commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater dimensions will be requested."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He says capital needs are "growing enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the timely closure of markets, he has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it is not possible to issue, but contrary to what happened in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the credit unions
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of savings bank mergers and stressed again the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings banks merger process began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been carried out, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been completely realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation as well," he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the manner in which it takes place within the deadlines that have been set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he said.
"The move from 45 coffers with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million assets is a trial unparalleled in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of serosity and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is reminding us that we have to meet the deadline before the end of the year".
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system that has started a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the greatest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has done well with the stress tests that BCE carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions prompted a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private investment agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins in criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to break the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, fiscal rigour, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for apology.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought needed to be done (fiscal rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow from the Central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the EU treaties to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although slightly sweetened, was approved, and in the following months we should see the process of reforming the Union that makes these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And it tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we do not agree too much, from then on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked to do is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater tranquility.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and the announcement of yesterday's new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, the path has been opened to the thesis that it is necessary to put the house in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, one cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone too full of unreasonable countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and Fraud Law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of ink to flow about the anti-sports character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the game (which their team was already clearly winning), both players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will carry out the regulatory sanction during the next game of the playoff against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and various economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not quite common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate that appeared in the case related is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn displays the nobility and honor and who in past occasions sentenced to a fine to its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, who provoked his story and added an episode of more trinic to his di.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation and contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions are a fraudulent act, because they are indeed actions that respect the sporting regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the kind of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, that is, there has not been a violent game.
Another of these assets that are alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the offending team from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not get an advantage in the same game either, because obviously the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club could not count on these players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indeterminacy, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a sanction match and move on to the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing up the ladder, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which nevertheless includes the making of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (this would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), but otherwise they chose rather the time in which they submitted themselves to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or escaping it.
Even though the boundary between genius and law fraud is diffuse, on this occasion I think we had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there have been two self-evictions and because of the way to transmit the director to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive of the offers to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tournament and the lottery, when December arrives also come back the dinner groups before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive you adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincided with the sector of the interview and businessmen.
To complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying out of their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The employer's representative, now, does not dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The deal will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with a good service", he adds, and recalls that customers have a tendency to go down a ladder with the crisis, so that the slice around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey of various establishments in the center, the collapse of requests for the night of the 17th was observed.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom in demands for that Friday, with the pretension to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in invoicing since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a bit.
On the part of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "animated", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons at a faster rate than any other country.
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details about the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are congested by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations to the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is running and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," Yuri Korolev, an expert at the Russian Foreign Ministry, told a meeting with his US counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange’s portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy dispatch in May, calling communication with Pakistan "frustrating," argues: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official with the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end tacit support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for the WikiLeaks leader
Obama will appoint a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent further infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be certain of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track Assange's movements".
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
In addition, this one is not new, otherwise it dates from November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
According to WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens, “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
On the 20th the international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order on request from Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries were given an indication to identify or locate Assange “to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot issue an arrest order for an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the Red Notice call a free path for arrest -- which the national police force must realize -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is believed to be the case in Sweden and England.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange solicited and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and in Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave Time magazine director an indeterminate interview via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they are spying on at the UN by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not at all sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counter-terrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators have been proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House, has asked the State Department to consider including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance.”
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to go back on his statements after saying Assange would have to "be murdered".
“Obama should turn it into a lens and use an unmanned plane or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
“Anyone in the government who has leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the nth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with winks that allow him to blind himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodicists want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand from the president a little more than making his position available to the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maxim organ between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive a roadmap until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The ERC leader confessed that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash his laundry in the family room.
In this line, the article that the current councilor Josep Huguet has signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the incumbent of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he has listed five of them, two of which he points out.
The first, to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through elected delegates.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion instructed the leadership to revise the assembly model in a specific statute reform congress.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this subject.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time might be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse in Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada, hands tied behind and eyes blindfolded.
The man had an injury produced by a gunshot in the neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza was reported, and two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the morning after the body of a man was located in Huixquilucan that had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to a message that his executioners had left behind.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunfire in the back of the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman were detected tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet strikes and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what is happening with those who do not align".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n Colony Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message beside it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of the country at COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed with respect to reducing greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the replacement of incandescent lamps with energy-efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser to the government of the country on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than one thinks.
For example, he said, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former leader of the Paniste has the right to appeal to the Commission d'Ordre National to demand what is lawful.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former leader Paniste has the right to appeal to the Commission d'Ordre National to demand what right.
In the interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, by making a complaint to the Commission d'Ordre du Conseil National, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he enlightened that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on December 4 and 5 in which a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, we enjoy it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to elect the best leader that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would replace "the person determined by the council."
“I am completely calm and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five.”
He predicted that the revival recorded by the party in the last July 4 elections will be reflected on the next dispute, although "this is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that there has been "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón over his speech during his four years in government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them get out of ‘the closet,’” he said.
He said that the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because in the country there is no gag, let alone censorship.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve the legislation," Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today gathered at the national rally to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree with the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve the legislation," Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps open a cybernetic link with a broader document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
“With a vote that we hope for soon, now is the time to listen to your voice,” he said.
The message was leaked after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block voting on any legislation if the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding extended.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved we can set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year.”
“I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “closing of debate vote” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted as of next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800,000 young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have remained in that country for the last five years and they have been accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the assistance of a large number of Republicans, at a time when the project’s partisan organizations protagonists intense lobbying to ensure approval of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nonetheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican expressed support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his stance so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which the participants showcased the narrative.
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment", the Argentine writer gently threw to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only leads in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "Patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who took his breath out in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is opened in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I was only able to know that it is what is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very intertwined.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exhibited a charming narration that he titled Praise of Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at one point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous enchantress who touched the clouds, turned back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to then speak America, the great news that had from the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted Bernal D<0xC3><0xAD>az del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of narratives.
Cervantes, who invented us all, made fun of the false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in one way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty.
Nonetheless, he pointed out, "madmen and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the “tradition of Cervantes”.
“It’s because of our heritage that we are what we are told.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with her round table Le must on the wound.
The Cuban-Porto Rican has put her own on the great scourge of social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes of trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not, of course, premeditated," she said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the engagement that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero who also stressed "it must on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every negation there is a small yes".
“To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting a finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also disturbing the powers who prefer a world in black and white,” he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three losses in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, although so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine ended up consoling himself with the under-champion medal, he stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The health strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Opening Tournament 2002, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with a 4-2 overall result against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely Ray.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team made a 2-2 equal match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got a 3-1 advantage with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the 4-3 jump result.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the helmsman when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I think that's the one game, it's not the one."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts in his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we only have to prepare, the previous tournament we hoped, unfortunately fate made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety that we have to keep the title between us".
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicant Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to show up at the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASCs) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for visa processing and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a one-time payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only appear at the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who wish to have a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency has cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will release an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which sparked speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, we make possible the arrival of 'bipartisanship', it is denounced.
The 60th had just set up when an opposition bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patrón Montalvo appeared in the Congress, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Houses.
Before initiating the session of installation of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tuned' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, bipartisanship is initiated because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute political marginality on the part of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that in the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be again enslaved by the two parties and in this way the opposing coalition will end.
"Until this has happened (the opposing coalition), that's what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, from Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolitical".
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipartisanship in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
PT’s Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that now Congress has turned into a ‘butt’ between the two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it in two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the personality of the member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let's not let them by cupular agreements out to five who will probably be 9 deputies, now to the five that we see, separated into different fractions, we decided to unite to look for a place on the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform that they made, that they decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform.
$200 million more for the "supplier"
The City of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount that was paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of suppliers account".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
“We didn’t buy anything, we just paid him what we owe him, as well as the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the provider has not yet published in the Official Gazette of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a business is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer has assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Northwest had published a revision of the cheques that the City Council issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennate of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune you lose, otherwise they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and only make the fix," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“They have not been given the attention they need and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious to everyone, the interview is necessary.”
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, under secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that need to get in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP calls for results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs should take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector in Mazatlán is calling for a dignified working legislature free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and facing major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 people's representatives.
The list of expectations that the new incumbents of the Governmental Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that MEPs should take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
“We hope that the MPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to watch over their own interests and they turn into carnival masquerade of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
“We will ensure that they do a dignified and above all committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add strength in seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
Regarding tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I have understood that this is the second Secretariat of the State with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as a major economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to classify resources for detonating tourism projects that help to give security to the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We are looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more or less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they desire so much.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live from day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
4-year-old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests waistwear for a year.
“He said to me (José Alfredo), ‘I’d like to have this monster,’ but I said to him, ‘We’ll see, my son,’ because he was very dear,” Cayetana recalls sadly.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, 11 years old, is shoe size 12; Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, 10 years old, is shoe size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, is shoe size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign On Quest for King Mage, giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were expected to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The search took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted nearly a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la S<0xC3><0xBB>reté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservatives' bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, is clearly going to be defeated when the three opposition parties said Wednesday they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
“I stand with a party that created granite under your feet,” Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, as he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow for up to one year's detention of anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he is targeting the wrong target.
“We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
The NDP’s immigration critic, Olivia Chow, has backfired criticism that her party is not firm enough on illegal immigrants.
“The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers and that is what we are doing through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are telling MPs massively that they don't tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a pavement."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections in the event of its rejection.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each member who opposes it would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, contends that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this issue as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
The public safety critic, Stéphane Bergeron, described the announcement as "a rabbit out of a hat" and "a handmade solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it, he just says.”
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
“The more Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the <0xC3><0x89>cole nationale d'administration publique.
To get out of this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General,” he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the cards of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another glide would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, i.e. 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday night, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is a fear of overflowing several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by Quebec Civil Safety for the Ouareau and the Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the object of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was swept away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a high alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Prediction Centre issued warnings Wednesday for heavy flooding for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partly blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Council for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks about social assistance and Haitians as well as his rude language on the air.
The CCNR finds that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day."
The Commission also concluded that a discussion of suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were inaccurate.
Hosts need to provide solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had considered that suicide is a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have addressed a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was therefore retained in his place.
The latest litigation was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then indulged in a face-to-face media that had sparked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI facilitator said he did not make any donations to help Haitians because it was not possible to know with certainty that the needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already cleared my three-day suspension on that.”
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of rude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during peak listening hours within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special career path.
The athlete who excels in “sand” (kung-fu “full contact”), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop in professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don't like ground play in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the man who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the UPS company delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories,” he said.
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the San Shu World Cup."
“The fighters who finished in the top four in the last World Championship in each category were invited.”
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth in the tournament, while I was third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
“At this pace, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China where punching and kicking, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned boxer from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely answer his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the friendly guy.
“It’s a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).”
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real pro,” he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded over-the-counter contracts of $450 million to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that obtained the largest, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
The Energy Stewardship consortium was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti québécois, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
“This is the new way of collusion and defeating competition.”
“In other words, instead of doing this secretly, people are now doing it openly,” said Sylvain Simard, a Pequist MP.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he says it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour".
She said that "it would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortia formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is underway and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Devoir, the formula of consortia in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s business register makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, leads back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay territory responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The Eastmain project's great boss, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Corporation (JESB), gave an explanation that made people wonder that the project's stewardship contract was awarded on an over-the-counter basis.
“If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Stewardship consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After auditing, Le Devoir had 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the Energy Stewardship contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before specifying that they were rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and environmentally friendly certifications to guide their choices.
Although he is immersed in a media world where messages for more responsible consumption are rife, he deplores a lack of credible information, a lack that he even calls a hindrance to his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the discourse of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this part of the consumption currently driven by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the void and doubtful nature of the information would calm the ardors of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the alleged performance of the green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all changed the brand of one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61%, they also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food products grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus du Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside its car, says the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State Loan for the Repurchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus et le Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only with a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving him his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan whose amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state offices.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris case.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State really needs to be discarded.
Recall that the Association des proprieteurs de cinéma et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to fund real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several stakeholders in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, for ten years carried out author cinema in his premises of the complex after financing its construction himself, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of theaters for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The Société Angus and the Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are conducting a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallele, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by showing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des deux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downside proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted over a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks unravel what the U.S. sees as the Canadians’ inferiority complex to Americans, but they also betray their sense of superiority to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are astonished that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, reports how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations for this situation.
“A near-inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues rather than pushing this election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, “the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically,” he said, “the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa’s Chargé d’affaires, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the early February vote of confidence on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30-40 billion stimulus plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties were making its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed stimulus plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series aired on CBC send back from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O programs, in which we observe subtle references to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or to the abductions for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that the spirits are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC’s airwaves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “murdered.”
He was echoed by Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Lighting
In Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n, the United Nations proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that is nearly one-third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolize 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorescent compact bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (LEDs), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of global fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize the climate rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - the company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all-new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
A number of specialists have reported reservations for compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and they need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set guidelines.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce wasted electricity in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion dollars.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire waits nervously for election results to be announced
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire "without delay" after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN chief said.
“It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission passed the Wednesday midnight deadline without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had told television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
Calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara multiplied on Wednesday.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director for the Ivorian president, said the United Nations' intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who denies any connection to the former rebels, said the delay in announcing the results was "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that making a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been split in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished ahead of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (SVC) published Thursday by the INSEE.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over the course of a year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people in the labour market has deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over a year) and 25% including the DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed under the ILO.
For their part, seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as over a year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only the 25-49-year-olds benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The INSEE has not published any monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, on the other hand, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the general council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was indicted and arrested at the detention centre of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been indicted for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, confinement, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexander Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strongman of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and found dead.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but run the landfills he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of it, said Mr Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts that are being accused of him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken this into account by not depriving him of his freedom," his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux, said.
Four other people had been indicted and released in the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two civil servants of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged with "subtraction and misappropriation of public goods by a person charged with a public service mission", the other for "complicity of misappropriation of public funds".
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was indicted for "rejection of abuse of social property".
Among the people who have been confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently caught in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of laundering money from big banditry.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a La Ciotat landfill, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysee exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the undersides of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to treat their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been a consideration for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man detained in France and wanted by the US justice system for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they shed light on how the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it wasn't.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The Elysée’s strategic affairs adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, meet with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forcibly detained nationals to Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "hammer constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
After the attempts at discussion through discreet channels, "silence will not settle anything", the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers".
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (€ 230,000 bail).
And he makes it known that the Elysée anticipates further hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
The Iranians could “in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States is calling for extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. embassy, like many observers, is questioning this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran’s clandestine networks for acquiring equipment for the nuclear program, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only “completely taken by surprise by the judge’s decision,” but sought to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not go back on the decision" judicial, he observes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser dialed a phone number, hung up, and then informed the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare its efforts, by means of communiqués and "leaks" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and see that the manipulation pays off since several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009, evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
The embassy in Paris asks what is the basis for so much "gratitude" expressed towards Assad.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians actually did."
The paper then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which “was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and undeserved.”
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"It should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot.”
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a so-called Cinderella law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to demand that online gambling companies block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"A lot of kids play these games all night and then have difficulty studying in school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who demand it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
FIFA World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA nominates the organizing countries
In the midst of turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday designated the countries hosting the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying could take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen competition will take place in Europe, the traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 one will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities who are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes treatments are therefore likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) cases have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavily on the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is enough to displease FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have been lobbying intensely in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front lines.
The head of government hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the Olympics 2012.
Will this intense activity suffice to renew the coat of arms of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the Spain-Portugal duo does not lack assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, Olympic-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the shortcomings in its file (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
As the world's leading economic power, home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, who have separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-hosted the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, which FIFA has long wanted, would effectively render Asian chances null and void by 2022.
With Qatar, which came out with futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weak TV rights paid (due to the time lag) by European countries, the nerve of war for FIFA.
Second Mandate: Evidence
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand had made it appear that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
A mandate at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make good use of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to act as if there is always doubt.
In one direction as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011".
Speaking to UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday night at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has sowed a bit of feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The President was merely reminding that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five-year terms to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has been talking about the presidential election, in the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me," he told them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they do not make him less.
If there is any comment, it is for a dual reason.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not Ségolène Royal's entry into the race that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an earlier order of battle than expected.
The wrong polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," the Prime Minister's entourage immediately and cautiously responded.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," Raffarin said.
"He will always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations that are to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the Frankfurt issuing institution will probably not be able to afford to be as peremptory as otherwise aggravate a situation more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde hailed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show more talk about his intentions, merely indicating that the program for the purchase of government securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main policy rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market operators that there will be a continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change in course.
While loan operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this mechanism to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's significantly changing her program."
"Otherwise, it would be risking further tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
- Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds to animate a weak market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the size of the exposures of European banks to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent an explosion of returns paid by the most fragile states," said a senior bond manager yesterday.
For if interest rates fly away, States will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government has a round back
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday with the ebb in 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the economy minister, regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, at least, the gap with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, leading to a certain collapse in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the gap with German rates was greater than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atonity of tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecast was a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (vs. 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (vs. 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilisation efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries," said OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan.
The issue of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
This would lead to an inconvenient period for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
In a press conference in Paris, Lagarde said: “Europeans, I believe we demonstrated it again on Sunday in the day and at night, are obviously solidary, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone.”
Although any relative, yesterday's relaxation on the rates of European government bonds brought water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about the start of normalization yet.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on banking systems in particular," say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well underway.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform Far Eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly paving the way for them.
The first issuances of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries on the front lines, Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are keen to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardisation of sovereign bond markets.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with, to date, EUR 60 billion.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snowy episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and risk disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne, have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later at night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, occasionally from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowy episodes are sufficiently noticeable to generate traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, several departments have been banned for trucks over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only in case of necessity and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to be cautious on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on Thursday at Roissy airport in Paris and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion euros are mentioned for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris is to build.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the SGP to borrow from the markets a part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, reviewed in the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the beginning of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
The figure is: "The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that pay?
Mysterious.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're a long way from the $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of capital endowment that will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," reads the statement of reasons.
At SGP, we don’t find this system shocking.
"From the moment you create revenues (both taxes), you can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4 billion after, it is explained."
"It will be included in the budget and drawn as it goes."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still to the absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat hectic parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Avengers and Spies in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals itself as an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file constituted by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The “extraordinary” U.S. revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits only report what could be read in any newspaper for months (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gaddafi’s sinisterly caricatured profile has long been for sketchy cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unpublished research (or know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occultism believe only in what they already know, and which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
Same for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (otherwise he might be, I know, editor at Liberation), who holds as true only what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have turned into centers of espionage.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put U.S. diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put so much the victims in crisis as the “bullies”.
But let’s get to the deep nature of what happened.
In the days of Orwell, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved completely since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel was already saying, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true, that all knowing about Berlusconi’s or Merkel’s character is indeed an empty secret, because it is in the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from her.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - that would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it's just as obvious that with today's technologies, it's useless to hope to be able to keep confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state travelled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relationships be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copies in locked drawers: deep down, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph.
The (analog) videotapes had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going back and forth and uncovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now the (digital) CDs only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the trips it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that communication policy and technology should come back to horse-drawn cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secrecy of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacks its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the promises of fast-start or early-stage financing made by developed countries are being met.
And the big French doughnuts are revealed.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (420 million a year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU released the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU said it had made €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen agreement, be "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference year: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years under fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment in terms of "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 lent equals €1 given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that rely on more efficient technologies), it is false to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, only the cost of the loan for the lender country should be counted under its commitments (equivalent of interest).
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so heavily.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts in €1 to meet its commitment, France puts in only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice pass-through tour!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it can make believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy did the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other member states continue to give if it was enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter on early financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in relation to all the climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the immense machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward the discussions on the issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope therefore rests on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Warning for pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly the Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and a snack in a day by a child of a decade, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, were tested by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The bottom line is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation clearly shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogen residues and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as nearly twenty residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even breadstick and chewing gum were packed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this “contaminant cocktail” “is probably underestimated,” according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "facing the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase of diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
