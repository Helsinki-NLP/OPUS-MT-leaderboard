Parliament did not support an amendment to free Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Penal Code condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of a deal with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet final, and the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
The Victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be defined who is the winner
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is about elucidating whether they are moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Koran.
In Libya an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it probably did not suit the Libyans already mentioned.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters accepted the help of unfaithful dogs gratefully.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When they look for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a shooting that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies get the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Shariah do not cross us.
A New Era of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe on the hunt for investors
A statistical whirlwind has spread throughout Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer looking only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical cabinets of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (increase of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquarter period, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> the trend to a gradual slowdown in economic development growth is shaped.
The results are even worse than analysts’ forecasts.
Main events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but has stagnated quarterly.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy fell 5.2% year-on-year.
The interest on your ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is also beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
Interest on Czech 10-year bonds remains at 4%, although the situation in the area is getting worse.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the European Championship.
They won 1-0 and celebrate the qualifying with a premium of 200 million.
The football team fulfills the most difficult task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to excellent <0xC4><0x8C>ech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, the win was 1-0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so that they will not miss the European Championship date.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of <0xC4><0x8C>ech and the heroic Jirá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the match were Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who missed two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup event, so the national football coffers will receive an approximate reward of 200 million crowns.
From the first few minutes, there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were just trying to keep the lines and played nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, kickers to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense managed to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With his gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students started praying outside the facility at noon on Tuesday and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center where uranium is being worked.
They intend to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is struggling to obtain nuclear weapons.
In Israel, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students prayed at noon outside the nuclear facilities in Isfahan and then hurled death slogans at the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be reached.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity affects 5%.
Obese children come mostly from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It re-demonstrates the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, sausages at least twice as often as children in normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had eaten chips the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a coincidence".
In families of overweight children there is no practice of sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 basic education children from all over the Czech Republic participated in the same survey.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th grade.
A proper diet and plenty of exercise in the family are determining factors, which significantly reduce the number of overweight and even obese children.
“Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the diet: breakfast, lunch, lunch, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results found.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, each has breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find that in 10% of households, nothing is eaten.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that families of obese children consume insane chips much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet soft drinks daily (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen boys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from ideal."
Among your favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
“The popularity of sweet sodas is alarming,” the study’s final report warns.
As the main meal, the palm takes the pasta and follows closely the poultry meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
“In the control group of study participants, who filled out the questionnaire after completing the prevention program ‘Obesity is not a coincidence’, there was in many cases a major shift in favor of the principles of healthy eating,” the study results point out.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer normal, running water.
Children would also more frequently choose poultry meat and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the industry, how to dress troubled characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone is short, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves, and someone is overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or trousers do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one extra piece of bespoke fabric.
They will certainly not regret it, because the clothes they feel perfectly are priceless.
With a tailored skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapes.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am happy that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who must design two locker rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It's been my turn to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have fattened about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
We have to cut the dresses out of magazines or search for them on the internet and print them, and then make them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the complete result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist, therefore, does not only physically dress, but also deals, for example, with the pages of products in magazines (concrete topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All of this was told by designer and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But all of this remains for Sunday.
The designer has to have a global vision.
The three specialist guests animated the conference on Saturday with information about all kinds of bodies.
Fashion designer Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a trench coat (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed in the classic with jeans and t-shirt, but also serves to dress the naked body with heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them," Jakub said.
At last it is clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (thus ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos, the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> assured us that image and style alone represent, in many cases, half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not yet a clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even the famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough for me, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, it must be borne in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate us a very different size from your real (smaller).
Then it just remains to gleam and find out if the heart magazines have already written about the topic, if a certain celebrity has fattened/thinned, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but he has to understand the outfit.
During your work, you should above all communicate with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he does not miss himself, he defends his opinions.
“When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and fill it up with pretty clothes, you can’t take and throw away everything there was and say, ‘What a horror!’”
“Find at least a couple of things you can ponder and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the job market.
This is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, scissors removers, or must-haves. There is also nylon thread (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as bags or hats), special clips hooking garments in front, if it is larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a set of cost.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, you could damage the sole and much more the outside.
And we did nothing but put on and put on.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors so as not to damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I don’t get those skills very well.
This is just a small part of everything we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already realized that devoting myself to styling at a professional level is not a pink path, but I don’t care exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run it competes all over America.
Reviewed
A trip, in principle carefree, gets complicated because of a series of improper carelessness of a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent the expectations were met, but this is of no use, if, in fact, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added to the title, aroused high expectations already before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, as a result of what is shown, it appears as a game that should not end up again being an action genre without more.
We are also curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in the NFS series, the results do not differ much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather it is the incomprehensible mischief of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
It introduces you to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
In this way, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
But in the mountains, be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of opponents (normal in a classic race), then you try to gain time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only make things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than would be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the aforementioned context, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous episodes.
This means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can search elsewhere.
But a race designed with plenty of action is quite suitable for this driving style, although we can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
From games of this type it is not expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a blow against any object, you cannot predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when making a very tight overtaking or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is only a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very trustworthy.
Sometimes, not even the reset helps, it only helps to learn the given stage from memory.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you will find yourself somewhere "civil vehicles" always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you angry especially in situations, when you see two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It is the same when you arrive, because it is programmed so that the “surprise” will always happen before your nose.
The opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will get to places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always lead you in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at whatever price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can make the car porridge.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it’s a shame, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and action-packed, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it really doesn’t matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or qualifying in the race so it doesn’t fit the boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is changing cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline suppliers next to the road, because precisely there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will be enough what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition to main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
Upon reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and ending up with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the subway tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark on the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind you the convoy of the metro arrives and takes you ahead without further ado.
In the editorial we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game nobody even thought a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects are in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
What a shame that, in the most tense moments, the image quality is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where there are many participants involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of their father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It feels like the game isn’t over.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will hit your eyes with the strength of airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
“I didn’t expect a war without barracks to be waged.”
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calm down and new players get used to their new roles," so began her conference at the Law School with conviction the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How not to take seriously his motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as would be the envy of many lecturers from the U. Carolina Law School.
Vicenová also considered the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is that if he's insulous, a gray official, capable of taking on any role, but I have to say that he left everyone bewildered, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go.”
The new post of representative for Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "Who is this EU, what number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union with regard to states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese from us.
Vicenová has also taken up the agenda for the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador: "a good uproar", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget must be approved, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive the most support, and which ones will be the least?
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
“The truth is, I don’t like the ugly abbreviations, the foreigners or the jargon that people don’t understand.”
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban Olomouc cheese from us?"
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of speeds awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive ones.
It also regretted the low participation of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approach me, a Frenchman by my side says to me, 'What, have you stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?', and you can see that it is not funny to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, is awaiting tough new budgetary policy rules for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new one of the "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure.”
“It was said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those that don’t, that they should stay out.”
"These procedures will increasingly strengthen the two-speed Europe," Vicenová said.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU must be discussed among the member states, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were to look for a term that would define IBM’s strategy with great precision, the closest approach would be “long term.”
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet a hundred years have passed since its foundation.
The foundation for this long-standing character was laid by the firm’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
Already he coined the motto that many of the world’s problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its hallmark, around which the life of the future giant will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully raised corporate culture.
“For us, IBM involves long-term thinking, a continuous move toward the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We look forward to further prospering in our second century,” said current company director Samuel J. Palmisano during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, cared about caring for his employees as the Ba<0xC5><0xA5>a businessman in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American workers to enjoy paid vacation, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning, the company knew how to discover talent (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years, where she has been Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
It is not surprising that there are plenty of ideas, as almost half a million people work at the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of an institution rather than a technology company,” says Harvard Business School economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company trying to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (develops both equipment and programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the highest number of patents of all U.S. tech companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill $220 billion this year. This year it has become the second tech firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first overtook Microsoft in 1996.
Looking into the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t anchor yourself emotionally in the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they don’t work, abandons them).
And that differentiates it from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly engaged in services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and one-fifth are computers.
However, even in 1990, teams accounted for more than half of the share of suppliers.
As of the year 2000, IBM has sold low-performing assets worth a total of $15 billion, and over the same period has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM operates on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that so far the IBM company has managed to overcome the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
One can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM History: From the Cheese Cutter to Spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 – originally it was a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation that led to the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
He possessed inventions such as the famous "signing clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM’s founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are built).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began producing and selling all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson led the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and the company’s massive continental expansion began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after almost forty years in the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "peces", which introduced the standard of computers of that time, came to the market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which in turn acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, meaning “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example in terms of transport and city administration.
For the commerce sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to hope that Josef would wake up from her pink sleep and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer like my partner," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová welcomed Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ové into her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá<0xC5><0x99> doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will kick him out.”
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old donkey who was wrong, but as a man to whom certain ties bind me," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová said, adding that he had already disengaged from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn’t mind that his wife has closed her back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
“My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it.”
"The company remains in force, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talk to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtá<0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rychtá<0xC5><0x99>ová found a new love, he would not object.
“We don’t sleep together and she doesn’t care about me, where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” concludes Josef.
Women’s worst vices: Are they referring to you too?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of the males?
Go shopping
Are you reproaching your half-orange for being dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cheat a week?
Do you like to buy often at sales?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to wander around the clothing stores, look for tight-fitting clothes and then try them all on the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can practically turn into hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner to wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
"I'd need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like it?"
Don't these phrases sound to you?
What do you mean?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her looks.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing their partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite tiovivo.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, remove dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for soiling a freshly cleaned washbasin and a shelf with glass doors that was so hard to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation," try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
"Used underwear is left with dirty clothes."
"You want to put on those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comments to your partner more times a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
Of course. You don't want to say anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Defamation and gossip
Some women also get slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracies against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, who, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossiping women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, they despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female workforce.
Jágr and Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek helped with their assists to beat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jágr took part in the NHL game on Monday with two assists that brought victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star’s move, and went one step further and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the meeting, Jágr told reporters overseas that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the match, I had told him I would make a triple.”
"I felt it."
"Sometimes they look like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first run.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trail.
Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek took the disc behind the Hurricanes' goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half they already dominated the Flyers.
Particularly for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot was queued for the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say I'm the best player on the court, but I'm sure he's in the top three," Jágr said.
“It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him.”
"I'm very pleased with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my teammates were playing for me, and that now produces results.”
Carolina still turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's penalties again to a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any further complications, although they ended up outnumbered by two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
“He cleared the record, I picked up speed and Read went to the farthest part.”
"I tried to target the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vorá<0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the game as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired for an upper body injury.
The Canadiens not only lost one player with a lot of defense experience, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the match with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
“We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels.”
“At last, but you can’t do anything about that, we have to deal with it,” Martin said.
"As much as rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to further simplify the game, pull the disc off our field."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty interventions from Winnipeg in the 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only five authorized state travel agencies: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time mostly sold trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists were therefore on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and travel of Czech tourists was then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but one had to queue up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" which was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The way Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million vacation trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that to the currently favourite destination, Croatia, until 1989 it was not possible to travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
In the early 1990s, visa-free travel to neighbouring Western European states was imposed, prompting a huge surge of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not fed up with the excursions to the west, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, groups of Czechs slept in parks in tents, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the Czechs of that time was to take food (canned, sausages, etc.) with them to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living was increasing and with it also average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 onwards, to regularly prepare travel using charter flight connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on passenger volume.
By the late 1990s, Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as early as 2000, when it was organized, thanks to enormous demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists depart every year to distant and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this epoch, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, arrived in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they have spent more than 15,000 Czech crowns per capita on foreign trips, including on-site expenses.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, who could end up again in a deadlock.
For almost five months Czech football has been without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be known even after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you will not be able to vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June not before summoning his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národn<0xC3><0xAD> d<0xC5><0xAF>m), located in the Prague neighborhood of Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment on and because of this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which full representation is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer be shed by the Executive Committee which, in its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which, from the association's leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round, the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," so Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees with what has been said, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates are more appropriate for Pelta.
“I would like to see the votes voted as much as possible in accordance with the statutes.”
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All passions will be appeased with today’s match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and in this way you will cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professional and regional.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
“It’s not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience.”
"This may result in a further blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, including Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifier will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, at last, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of Sport (<0xC4><0x8C>STV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the lottery house Sazka.
Paclik will fight for the presidency because he can’t find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), neither would he run for such a relevant position.
“If there were a suitable person, I would be fighting for them and I wouldn’t run as an election candidate.”
"But to this day we have not been able to find such a person," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (<0xC4><0x8C>TK)
What motivates Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R).
Paclik also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve already talked to a few people that I could take into account.”
“It was crazy for me to hear some people say that at the moment they don’t even want to identify with Czech football.”
“I would like to change that view,” he adds.
What is supposedly most annoying to Paclik at the moment is Pelta’s relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclik it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case he wins, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit,” Paclik said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta’s name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring to Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us," said Paclik, who also takes some caution from his previous statement that he would "sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday's election, Paclik could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He's very capable."
“I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the representation.”
"but not as a manager of an association."
“I also don’t put my noses where I don’t feel capable,” added Paclik, who in September garnered much attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitrators’ Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He draws on his management skills of private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
“To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which likely tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeals committee, producing unpleasant situations,” Paclik said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
“It’s one of the key issues that the new president should be dedicated to.”
“If they were to raise gambling taxes, as political parties are announcing, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to go,” he says.
In addition, Paclik now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I see no sense in hypocritically ceding my Pilsen Club actions to someone else and then returning there after a year and a half," Paclik said.
Pelta promised the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R new statutes that would end the deadlock in the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitely serve to resolve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral regulations.
The Jablonec representative is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes the pre-election conflict could move toward a solution today with the football team's possible victory.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do well to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
“People at all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president on Thursday.”
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and on the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," Pelta said.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as a lure to win delegates.
“If I’m elected president, I’ll take it as a personal challenge and I’m willing to respond in case this fails.”
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” Pelta says.
Also, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
“He’s been in the football world for over a year, and he’s already achieved some successes.”
“Their attacks were embarrassing and many people were surprised by the election campaign.”
“That’s why many of them doubt their true character,” he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for promoting football.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"Immediately afterwards I would engage in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal changes to the squad.
“I would have to know the tasks of each employee first,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios ahead of the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel to Nymburk in vain on Thursday.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working eagerly.
If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, in case he is elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He is also committed to resolving the Bohemian case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work begun by former President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to dedicate myself completely to football.”
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee in such a way that each member can devote himself to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others.”
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step,” he explained the reasons for his indecision.
“A lot of people have told me that I shouldn’t give up, because then others would give up too.”
“It’s about having faith so you don’t give up like that,” he said.
According to them, he is also motivated to continue the work he has already started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“During those two years, a lot of the work was done that I don’t want to lose now.”
"There are processes that have been started and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said, worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be as it was before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's time.
“I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
“Behind him is above all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a select few.”
“I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
“Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into one Czech and another Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not be the current situation in which we have only three Moravian teams, which represents a problem for the young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although Toma<0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the presidential election, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
“I’m still sorry to have strong support from the Czech Federation, which has elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes,” said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantaged contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of the guilt that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he considers the other rival, Paclik, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has already started and will not significantly change the staff on the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” he said to his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Those who visit Europe can experience its blue wonder, and after a visit to the city or a hike, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing in her luggage, a swimsuit.
Leaving her back on the water, she looked up at the artistic dome, swimming towards the marble angelots, waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and was amazed at the meticulously restored Modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, he took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathing fans have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while jogging fans can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or hear the cheerful trills of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The splashing in the pool and the ethereal oils in the sauna. The wellness factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, indoor pools can be a real gift to the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is optically folded: the tall vaults, the colorful tiles, the trampolines.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historical oases of well-being, but, mainly, it makes you want to jump to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are nitrate waters in a unique karst cavity (cavities baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jász).
Many open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looks at Zurich’s rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary awaits customers in Längenfeld: The water cathedral of Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not invaded by the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Arpad baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the pestilence of diesel is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legame sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a pleasure of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a spot in her search for nice places to bathe, when she wanted to visit outdoor pools and sunbathing in the Czech Luhatschowitz bath, she found a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
As Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow Modernist building, he saw the weeds grow among the tiles.
The decline was countered by a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; you can not only discover neo-Romanesque elements from the times of their construction in 1844, but also an Arab hall in the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of pool collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to fuse different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank analyses the commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to assess the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving up prices, and banks are taking responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate’s campaign is aimed specifically at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, bets on commodities were thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled themselves from bids and demands, and take profits from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than American competitors: he promised to review the claims and said no business “deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank’s good reputation.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank’s board of directors, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank’s management will report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, the founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The bets on rising food prices show in an especially drastic way how ruthless banks are currently harming the public welfare.”
Ackermann stands as the biggest banking lobbyist, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank must nullify all investments in its portfolio where it puts money at stake for food price betting,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agrarian speculation you can perfect your image.
And he needs to care as soon as possible losses, that's what his successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would nullify investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on food prices.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when they discovered that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would nullify all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 percent would discourage such a bank from its acquaintances, 49 percent would ask, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
The 21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture is passionate, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is a suitable and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well-known that he also built the Austrian pavilion in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to Vienna's South Station, was reformed in 1962 and a 20th-century museum was inaugurated inside, it was called the "20th House".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Today, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, opened with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, PhD in art history with a considerable career, among other things, artistic ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the modern art museum in Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his move to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy devourer," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office,” says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The "Brussels flag" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why it wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, there has been an urban stroke of luck. The completely new and planned "central station neighborhood", with houses and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city over a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that amounts to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of personnel must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against winter-induced train breakdowns and delays, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, of the planned investments until 2005 of a total of about 300 million euros.
For this, better availability of vehicles and the railway network must be achieved even with extreme weather.
Among other things, it is planned to bend internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of breakdowns and delays in trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fines in the U.S.
After the tumult over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem arises, the Deutsche Bank must pay there a million-dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the disputes due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA blames many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank admits no guilt with the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
NCUA is attempting to reintegrate the losses of millions.
The agreements currently concluded are their first type.
The regulator had also called for accounts from other major banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it led to the perdition of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, there is currently a complicated wind blowing for U.S. banks.
Investors and inspection have launched countless lawsuits to receive compensation or penalize misdemeanors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It accuses the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Also Deutsche Bank has a demand from the FHFA, it deals with businesses worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to answer for “substantial losses” without giving an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Contributes $10 Billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett is investing heavily in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or information technology as the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He must have understood long before that IBM mainly offers services and seeks computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technology should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has revealed at CNBC that it has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has soared to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM had not yet heard of the compromise.
He praised the leadership that dealt with ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They’ve done a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of computing centers.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortiums such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
This is why it is an idol for countless investors from all over the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname “Omaha’s oracle.”
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s publicly traded shares rose one percent.
“The Blue Giant,” as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and ranks, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world’s most valuable tech companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The Threat is Concrete
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
One newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is revived again.
The murders of eight small businessmen and Greek tricksters between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost that was long believed dead has returned, since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no further episodes of violence against Turks against the far right.
However, there has never been a question of xenophobia in Germany.
The discovered far-right network reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were by no means predictable.
“Is the bloody ideology revived again?” headlines the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" on the contrary highlights that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German broadcast "Hürriyet" also does not insist on drawing this mental connection.
“It starts to smell bad,” says the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He points out that the murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not long before sought out suspects in the far-right circle.
Some are less rhetorical about the drastic means: “From now on, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and armament.”
"This will be the best self-protection."
“The internal peace of Germany depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network,” Selen writes.
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the attacks on Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been etched in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group feeling on the Turkish side.
Not repeating the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the lack of German politics after the attacks was criticized, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit Mölln's survivors.
In the wake of the Solingen fire attack, he sent a telegram of sympathy to the Turkish President, and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how a person’s value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
Current Turkish media reports once again show how profound the distrust of many Turkish-born Germans in the legality of this country has since been.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a re-evaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Lake Zurich scandal
The riskiest bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it is run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought of it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit in July, it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the board of the big Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and lets down kind remarks about its future peers.
“USB has achieved a revitalization.”
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all of the bank’s security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the board of directors of the USB was considered equally touched since then, and everyone asked: When will Axel Weber arrive?
Weber will have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation that is surely necessary.
Suddenly he becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved again that it deserves the title "the largest bank of the scandal in Europe" for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slips from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis has begun.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The discreet and solid but also handy image of the Swiss asset manager, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB handles more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s major banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later banking professor in Zurich for many years explains: "In front of my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank."
“From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To top it off, USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, naturally that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian, opaque Singaporean state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 on the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its erroneous investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought troubled securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was stated how dramatic this was for a small country, if it housed such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS’s balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times higher than Switzerland’s economic performance (see chart).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a fiscal conflict with America and was willing to hand over data from wealthy customers, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the bank’s help.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS confessed more or less to having helped in tax fraud.
At the same time he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
Thus, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in asset management through aid to tax evasion.
And just when it was going to be a little quieter again, just when it was thought that UBS was going to get it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator disappointed 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it was revealed, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also confident: “The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls.”
Thus arose the idea of precaution, with which Swiss bankers had long been presenting themselves, to be the guardians of the world’s greatest goods: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of the Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry stores like Tiffany<0x60>s among traditional Swiss businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, through the Credit Suisse Palace, to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS by means of a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bank there is a large sign to indicate the "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
The UBS has become too big, he says, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came disaster, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-strong country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do you think?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to complement the two different UBS precursor banks: a wealthy but dormant bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
“Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from learning at the bank to the summit.”
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: The insanity came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the consortium’s head, always repeated the same motto: Getting Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headlined the "League Tables", the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
A few steps went well.
In forex trading and stock trading it was at the top.
However, the advisors of commissioned companies highlighted a weak point: In the international interest business, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Eager for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its high-risk funds created in high-risk U.S. investments.
It transformed into a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgage loans and then selling them, keeping certain risks on their own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the descent for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
Positions at UBS have become projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Nowadays, whoever runs a large bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea, to end investment banking, to focus on asset management, to return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must decline a lot, it is clear now.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he imposed himself: He must permanently run the business of UBS, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Abolish 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's that?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a home with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The looming recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors at the start of the week.
The changes in government in Athens and Rome remain ineffective.
The restrained industrial production on the continent quells the hopes of stabilizing at its origin a debt-induced crisis.
General relief may not be imposed on the changes in government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was half full, not half empty, but now the problems come back to the fore, said Janney Montgomery Scott’s Mark Luschini.
First and foremost, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard stocks closed with a 0.6 percent drop to 12,078 points.

Companies produced two percent less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat’s statistics office.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be liberated so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
For this reason, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws overboard a decade of old principles and enters the American tech sector.

Smart fats spread in cities
In many places grasses are considered "problematic birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulating complaints from neighbors about the crap and the noise of animals.
Although no means have appeared against "problematic birds" so far.
The grass no longer leaves the cities, say experts at the first grass symposium in Leer, East Friesland.
There specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected grass fields; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end traditional living spaces.
The hunting, the growing construction and the falling of trees that host them make it difficult for the birds to live.
The grasses are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to mass-kill the district's rafts jumped into the negative headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by bird traps and killing with sticks especially brutal.
"Expelling them and chasing them away in a normal way does not achieve anything," said Werner Klöver, urban planner and landscape designer of Leer.
Shooting nests with water or throwing trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals deviate, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Evicting them is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or colleges.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits to resettle elsewhere is possible.
"Informative panels instead of chainsaws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against it in order to treat animals in an entirely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a beak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger grazing teaching circuit, where signs inform about the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticisms for the noise of birds: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, gravy not only take advantage of resources to access shady bites, but they make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four bars how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second rehearsal, the cunning greases had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the handle of the tube.
Three of the four riders got it on the first try.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope for the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the first leg, made the five EURO appearances in a row.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the play-offs return match with outsider Montenegro, after they made things clear in the one-way match (2-0).
Croatia did not let him score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a weak 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia failed because of Portugal in the play-offs of the 2010 South Africa World Cup.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a direct freestyle from more than 30 meters to get to the top of the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not show up in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance thanks to scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of England's Manchester City, kicked a header to the club, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit for Czech Republic
The collegiate Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was then in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark scored a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished with the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion is ranked for the fifth time in a row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal on Tomas Sivok's own goal (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the lap from the front, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the spar of the world-famous goalkeeper, the FC Seoul striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb’s football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink was to leave his seat on the third bench of the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost achieved a dream principle.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole, and attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to send the ball into the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly took control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow any goals to be scored.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute took over Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish are celebrating their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team, who triumphed 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a previous decision, to lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied for the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
In the 32nd minute, he went ahead.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, getting 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, invests billions over the next few years in China and wants to nearly double its number of employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will circulate, the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
"We will get more R&D facilities and hire workers," Bill McDermott, co-chair, told a conference in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from 2,500 workers currently to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of SAP’s more than 176,000 international customers are headquartered in the country of the boom.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the dax consortium’s 2012 strategy.

“Our goal is to trigger lasting growth in China through extensive instruction.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story About World War I, “starts with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one fall soul to the feet.
Here are some action tips: Start this page gently and turn it into your branded pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novel narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he rightly describes as "a work of anti-history."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened," it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
“The beauty and pain of battle” combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix while others go out.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the disastrous trench war on the Western front.
“The beauty and pain of battle” expertly moves through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a heartwarming book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordita.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why this war has to be fought.
"A lack of facts," observes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
“The Beauty and Pain of Battle” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor from the offshore fleet.
His stories have been obtained mostly from memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
The explanations of their lives can be terrifying or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and coping with what’s out there.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice and pressed in ram fat (and topped with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peels of dried potatoes; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive toward savagery and expresses about war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are conceived for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a bestseller, and pretend that that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, tachon breast."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will find out or care about it.
“Once one resigns to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, he is horribly like “a condemned man being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in good clothing who executes his carnage while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about the soldiers who actively tried to catch a prostitute venereal disease as a way to evade service at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the gonococcal pus trade, which soldiers buy and embadurnate their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifelong blindness."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes it reflects the way the war unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People begin to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's Modern Memory, or novels such as Novelty on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction play.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen the night of Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others that they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, could not be repeated, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the “okupas.”
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared themselves to see how occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking toward Zuccotti.
Agents increased so-called disorder training - counter-terrorist measures that involved quickly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
“The few cops I know who were called for this, they weren’t told it was to enter Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
“The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the apartment.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the city's district - dozens of mobile agents who routinely used to flood high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said a lot of people, like those who travel daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there was the least number of people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with spotlights and loudspeakers were congregating at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages resounding from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters just picked up their things and left.
No shops were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed at the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they tried to prevent police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by agents.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture footage.
As police moved west through the protesters’ dense tangle of personal effects, including baggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic stuffed with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, images appearing on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were locked in their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made at the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for “altering public order and resistance to authority,” he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief detective, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block to the north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen air-tapping from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
The union of support workers will sue the city for the layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the 37th municipal district, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid lost their jobs on Oct. 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked him saying that nothing in the budget specified that members of the school’s support staff would be fired.
A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city’s Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers laid off as plaintiffs, all black or Latina women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in the city’s poor-area schools to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees as they had been chronically undersubsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36th Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.S. District 36’s budget slashed by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" most often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
“Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired,” says the draft complaint, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi to be captured and killed and for US involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a bipartisan affirmation of support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the Libyan debate has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties quarreled with each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never came to be voted on in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a sort of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoyed enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience to liberate themselves” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs committee, or will it divide legislators as did the June bill?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to bring their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte’s is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates – the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate – and others with slight variations on each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful that will “control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors — especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes — the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of such a move.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one banning the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the nullification of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly filed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren’t much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added – 27 – was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman fired at her at a constituent event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords appeared on national television Monday night, sang along with Broadway's melody "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The show documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, which passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the House by surprise to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang – and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When asked by Sawyer how he feels, the 41-year-old Giffords responded, “Good enough.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special program, which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program looked at Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar pierced her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up while her husband cheers her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toasted", a request for change on their breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspect gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
"You've only been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
Troops make you feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and marines broke into their posts around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They showed them as kind of an orphaned child,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
He lavished the troops with praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
Increasingly, the public acts as if they are sorry for those in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls.”
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity are conducted quietly and privately among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an “angry and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding job from Washington immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
Military unrest arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are seldom chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praises of politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of a service member’s suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-time soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked her if she could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded like an alarm signal,” Lyman says.
The Texas native, however, set aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
“I wish I had listened to my instincts.”
Within minutes of entering Lyman’s room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, on Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread violation among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or impart adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to get the army's big plane, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have contacted her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, headed by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy — in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active-duty personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of plaintiffs’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the military that focuses on diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles claims of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted on the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response.
However, the attacks are remarkably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which account for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke’s case describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, he reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times differently to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged author, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember I told my commanding officer, ""That wasn't his judgment, that was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from service on less-than-honorable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow lawsuits continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn’t have the same incentive and deterrence that accountability poses.
“The odds are strongly against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go your way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ attorney, will queue her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military on this issue until the reform takes place,” he says.
"Or until we die, whichever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aired his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: he had spent most of the time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook’s personal information stash is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific precision — the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then directed ads to them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
By arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of doing research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, men and angry at immigration.
However, in a sort of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stand behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in “likes,” wall posts, and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom, pushing the number of academic papers with the site’s name in the title to nearly 800 percent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student post too many status updates with their drunkenness.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise not be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “picking” its own population for data.
The site’s Data Team has compiled statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of voter turnout in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using the information that can be accessed – long-time digital freedom advocates who argue that the site should make its vast amount of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with the public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know what part of a user’s profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen remain the best research tools that no one can use.
“There’s no substitute for getting into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway,” he said in front of a room filled with 500 people.
“I oppose the court, as it received mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because “I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views.”
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written speech in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, barred him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre notion of being part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge ruled that he is not a mentally ill man, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t,” a relative of one victim said.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs’ Missing Interview, Shown In A Theater This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special projections in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was certainly a designer, dreamer and self-recognized hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flowcharts – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease consisting of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the job... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
By that time, it had barely been 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely’s interview was used on Nerds, he said the interview’s originals disappeared during their transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full copy was discovered on VHS in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited footage is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute Missing Interview, which hits Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his tech philosophies and trading strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking accuracy.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient due to Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward the most important themes or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic about The Missing Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision for the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Missing Interview:
About how you learned to run a business:
“Over the years in the business, I’d always ask, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they give you invariably are, ‘Oh, that’s just the way it’s done.’
No one knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Bewildered by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done with a good eye, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs in detail.
The joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and screaming through the public phone and going back a minute later to the public phone from the next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandoned, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while making his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was woken up to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling over the phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made him a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a summer part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age and it formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I would get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time on that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a client if he could assemble the whole equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments ... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble in his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say that you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, and what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
The sales and marketing departments increase success, so it is this kind of people who end up running the companies and the people in charge of the products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position is rotting because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs. bad products - the knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
“There’s a huge amount of work going on between a great idea and a great product...as the great idea evolves, changes and grows.”
A lot is learned about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t make electrons do, glass does, robots do, factories do.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end, it all comes down to taste – it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you’re doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who casually were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health care law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama’s health care law challenge, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were hosted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will lay the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the petitions for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a battle cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the lawsuit and, in fact, a historic 5-and-a-half-hour plea is expected by March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court’s decision comes to light.
The lawyer who will appear in court and claim that the law must be scrapped will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it is not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says, “A judge may attend events to raise funds from law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’s absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as to a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This impressive breach of ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several magistrates that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, the chairman of Common Cause.
“The judges were hosted at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have pending court cases.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising funds for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say they too easily mix the court’s activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Magistrate Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as the attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to.
Boeing Receives Record Order of $18 Billion
Emirates ordered 50 Boeing 777 double aisle aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It’s rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft maker Boeing Co. and the selling price for the 50 planes rises to a record $18 billion.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft for its dollar value - 50 Boing 777 double aisle jets.
The successful order came from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total selling price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect on Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the highest costs - is not so harmful, because the country is making money with the rise in the price of oil.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The UAE order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the widebody market and helps keep at bay its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Apparently Defeated in Michoacán Vote
Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she claimed on Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, from the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday’s vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... seized the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly outpaced Calderon, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidatures out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections in Michoacán may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year."
The BAsD urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avert a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director general of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world’s two fastest-growing major economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries looking at Europe’s hardships in a “impartial” way and said that Asia’s financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avert a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has heightened fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channeled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power for Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an imperative, because where do we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
“At some point you’ll realize that the Greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and going on vacation to the beaches and that’s not going to go well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous, well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs of under-managed, loss-generating companies like railroads.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces “downside risks” due to Europe’s threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious Pentagon Warnings About Potential Defense Cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that the impending automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a chain financial backlash from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “kidnapping,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a halt to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects unable to be executed – you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily remove many of our civil servants and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to discharge civilians in order to meet the target.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and would seriously damage the good disposition.”
The cuts would eventually reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
“While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the kidnapping, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in base budgets,” Panetta said.
"The hiring of personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war."
"The payroll staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would provoke a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are firmly against this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is not an outcome with which to live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“Kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly candid about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing tough decisions.
At a news conference last week, the Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what might lie ahead – an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an air wing without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to fulfill the mission,” Panetta said in her opening words at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries.”
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the reductions “generate significant operational risks: delayed response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new onshore combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate some $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and tackling potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the most recent headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “punched” with an open microphone claiming U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner ridiculed his denials quickly rebutted by irrefutable proof.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been instances where teachers have given test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception did we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim, “I have you,” the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been rebutted.
Liars look in the eyes.
They don’t always stutter, babble, blush, or disturb.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years probing scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, make them feel comfortable, manage their own emotions and intuitively feel how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies," while women tell more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they usually tell tend to be "normal").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline."
It helps provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter, and vocal characteristic.
It’s best to know if someone normally hits their feet all the time so they don’t make unfair accusations when they see their feet hitting in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for misleading, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as warning signs, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet at the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-interview relief" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely make it appear that the interview is over only to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson shook his paw to the bottom and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
People who cheat can also use distancing language: "I didn't have sex with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question altogether.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... as far as I know... to my understanding."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to uncover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Diverted After Threat of U.S. Delay in Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- enraged unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company looking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to reroute it.
TransCanada said Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the Nebraska Capitol press conference.
TransCanada’s director, Alex Pourbax, says the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department’s announcement last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until potential new routes to avoid the Nebraska Sandhills areas and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater, are studied.
“This is a real path to progress,” Rep. Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013 after next year’s elections, although officials denied the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s request, and expressed his full support for them.
The 1,700-kilometre pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only raised limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrifying her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
"Lady Marmalade" singer Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, was so frightened that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family said in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when plotter Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
“Someone came up from behind and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and I went to get her,” she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman in anger.
"He said in an aggressive tone, 'I shouldn't have left your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
“I said, ‘I have no interest in what you say or think.’
He became enraged and began to use bad words - the word C and the word J out loud...
He had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water out of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the girl's mother said.
LaBelle jumped at the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be restrained by her surroundings and withdrawn to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
The family later sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a cancer support association.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," Davis said.
“That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it’s directed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old boy in her arms.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-described the change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, on the other hand there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions of losses to the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damages, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage in 582,835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed a thousand thousand accelerated, as from January to March average 55 thousand 053 percent of people in the state were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Population Economically Active, and a 6.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a resource restriction by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illicitly it is not easy for them to work, invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entering, and secondly because entering they also have a lot of difficulties to find work, those people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in the state work without being quoting as a worker at any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Together with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 there was the largest decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economy from January to June of the state FDI totaled $ 630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143,312 dollars recorded during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Faced with the scenario of economic contraction, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, the same that would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to reactivate the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2,6 billion pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of the sector in debt.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, lacked the effort of all and above all the good synchronized march of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo Lopez said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year halted the state’s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, stated that it is necessary to prosecute the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
“Overall we have observed that work has been being done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is unleashed,” he said.
Work to do
The president of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better aligns the Government’s efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the government has been striving for good results in different areas, there are some progress in terms of economic development but it is important that a long-term program be developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in how it conducts public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
A neighbor in Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a 100-day fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office reported that the convicted narcomenudist is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenudist was riding in a pick-up truck, white, where he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle's box and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was left at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person continues to be interned at the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Must contribute to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although the work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because they have not fulfilled the State Government with the corresponding contributions which add up to a resource of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the completion of these becomes valid.
"They have almost 12 million to contribute and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share," he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute at that time.
"It happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, has been requested to expedite the efforts so that the corresponding percentages reach as soon as possible.
“It’s almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a fifth.”
Court validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that brought the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, by failing to gather the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it arranged for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the minister-president said he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not consider that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the state.
The replacement of analogue with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision in the public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, which in any way invades the sphere of competence of the Congress, since it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
Possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to the PREP data, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes are not counted.
The possibility of "vote-by-vote" counting is a reality with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to data from the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, yet the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes are not counted.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not approve its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal period so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the deadlines provided for in the Law of the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that some had.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as "invalid and illegal" the state president's vote on constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may take place in the event that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of scrutiny and counting in the file of the box or does not work in the possession of the president thereof; or, when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumed to be the winner of the election in question and the candidate who obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is the express request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that applied for the second.
The total count of the vote may also be made if at the end of the ordinary counting it is established that the difference between the candidate allegedly winning and the one located in second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, in which case electoral packages that have been subject to partial counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His Last Will
Their ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during Monday were held reconnaissance and a mass of requiem.
According to his relatives the last will of the lieutenant colonel was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinamé.

Three abandoned corpses found in Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened at 1.5 km of the Cadereyta road to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed the place observed that in the fifth, whose bard is beige with coffee, there was the wide open gate.
Looking inward, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow t-shirt with dark denim trousers, without shoes; next to him was another with a white strapless t-shirt.
Just a metre away was the body of another individual wearing a red t-shirt and blue denim pants.
All three were face down.
According to data obtained at the site, the three people were reportedly killed elsewhere, as no caps were found at the site.
In the bard of the fifth can be seen legends that are directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
Capture 11 in Cadereyta
The Ministry of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "falconing" and clandestine burials.
According to the information released, in a first incident on 11 November in the colony Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who remained deprived of his liberty was rescued.
They were secured three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident that occurred on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel made a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
As they were marking the stop and performing the inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in the ejido La Frauda, who, upon seeing the military, tried to escape.
They are credited with clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster.
Italian Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his bid to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well outlined,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the battered confidence in Italy.
Underscoring pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put Italian 10-year BTP bond yields above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government very much.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone’s current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections are overdue.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his reluctance to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements among parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rubbing of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Ticos
Of the 22 footballers named from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 contestants made it to the 50 games.
A major contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 called by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly ranking, have an extensive record of Class A inter-selections, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a as the only one to have all 50 international matches.
That figure reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain intense activity every year in league championships and domestic cups, and high-level clashes in European cups such as Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated qualifiers of the EURO and the World Cup.
Tics players, on the other hand, have limited international friction in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish national team is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona’s brain steering wheel, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke's hammer, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l González, with 102.
Nearly close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and close to Michael Uma<0xC3><0xB1>a, are left-back Junior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 presences and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Less.
More than 30 performances in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't approaching 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one that records as many with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country on its two-decade-long celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to deliver one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band assures that for them too will be making the dream of playing in the country a reality.
Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week, said.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the Estadio Nacional, starting at 7:30 p.m., alongside the Angelina band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it’s a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I have been in Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we will be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask him because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What do they say to their most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the past 21 years have happened over the past couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hopefully that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Watching the tour, they’ve been delivering huge shows with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not played for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have been forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us imagined we’d be in a great rock band and having done it for over 20 years made it seem like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It’s always been an honor to be part of that group of great bands.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something unusual.
From time to time, a band emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re fortunate to be friends with all of them still and we’re honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came out.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yeah, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is a lot longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give everyone the freedom to experience.
We entrust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance sheet?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you’re not too on tour because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that reminds you to respect the music and what brought it, without falling in love with being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very close friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think about the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do they always change Yellow Ledbetter lyrics live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Among the first that I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s a wonderful thing because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed touched them on me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs definitely represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted Tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for muscle strength loss in his legs, his GP said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he is known to be innocent.
He was operated four times on cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in custody since September 2007 at the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official entourage, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information in all that are the political affairs between the two nations," as published by the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has presided over the G20 since November, a group made up of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements in order to get off the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to stores around the world this month, has been designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to wear glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's Spanish press officer, Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally intended for that support", since hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth gameplay.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once passed, the more expert will be able to give a "second lap" to the levels of the game, which this time present more difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario in the three dimensions is also the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that did not occur since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo nods to fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous installments, consisting of that the mustache plumber will have to tour platforms mined of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in moves, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom supports extradition of Portillo to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has formalized the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that demanded Portillo to judge him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was due to the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He said that during his tenure he “didn’t get his hands on” court rulings and processed all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done is an executive procedure after all judicial and constitutional proceedings have been exhausted to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once his legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and his human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of untrained boys
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
To this is added the hundred long jobs that are currently created for this social group.
The anniversary served to take stock yesterday at an event held in the former factory complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradication or in a position to fall into marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the former councillor of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gom<0xC3><0xA0>.
The current councillor of Benestar Social i Fam<0xC3><0xAD>lia, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large room of the Fabra i Coats.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evicted an occupied farm where macro-partying took place
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, France.
The 12 occupants left the farm at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 rue de Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday at noon the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-parties that despaired of the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was finished, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building -the rest are inhabited-, took all the electrical installation and part of that of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the invaders of the farm made it unfair competition, since they sold the drinks for three euros, while in the discotheque they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighboring complaints for noise, while, she pointed out, the discomfort is not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house occupied and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the inconvenience was so great that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that in recent weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the city council, Alberto Fernández D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had demanded last week "immediately evict the property to end the problems of coexistence and civics that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squats had been entering every floor of the building and almost every floor, and that in some there have even been robberies.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to end impunity and be forceful against the incivism that has been generated on the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police went to 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies over fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some Pasquinas for the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again placed, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola’s classification as a natural park is a result of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
It was there until, in September, the city council convened a megacompetition consisting of 16 contests for as many access doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, without a doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question comes up alone: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it implies of reflection on the city, is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring topic to take hold of when two members of this ancient caste of elect recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel M<0xC3><0xB2>dol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate about "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerd<0xC3><0xA0>, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is possible to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, says the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": we must not think of them "as the accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers derived from the "uncertainness that it is today to project the public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the F<0xC3><0xB2>rum area "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders over where it can be built.
“Limiting something is fixing the next step,” that is, its overcoming.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (MGP)] can give rise to real disasters."
More closely related to the question, M<0xC3><0xB2>dol thinks that, in simplification, the Vallesana slope of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", for a purely topographical matter.
M<0xC3><0xB2>dol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" as to whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a right", points out) that have had to be created: "Architectures should be only a tool".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been called -he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This causes, at least in your case, that you have chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In his opinion, however, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that would effect a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino Forgive Jonas Larrazábal and Leave Free
After 72 days of entrenchment, the legal representative of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is following a blackmail process against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, published a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the regional council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public denunciation, the State Prosecutor ' s Office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panista mayor and on 2 September he was arrested and held for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecution Officer 3 in Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for 49 days after a second warrant was issued after the Public Prosecutor ' s agent dismissed the offences of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; however, he remained only a few hours in the prison of medium security as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an arrest warrant by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was verified to determine Jonas' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the mayor; so that in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Public Prosecutor’s agent attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and thereafter no claim may be filed regarding the process that followed him; in addition, he will not be required to redress damages or punishment.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmaker, around 15:50 was ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yanez, moved to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonas that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of the Governorate, Francisco Blake, and seven others lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of the Governorate, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations carried out in the impact zone did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
“In a search it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
“The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation can last several months, it could even reach a year.
Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations the flight was carried out under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located suitable conditions for take-off, as the aircraft advanced towards the area bordering the DF and the State of Mexico presented layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and sideways trajectory.
The scattering pattern of the aircraft debris allows us to assume that the helicopter was impacted on the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
At the site of the accident, there is still no evidence of an explosion or fire in the wreckage of the ship.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was foreseeably disarticulated along said path.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned site, around the crash, no scattered pieces of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security Leads Research to Discover the Obesity Gene in Children and Youth; Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called 'Genetics of childhood obesity and adolescence' protocol, which will allow markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center XXI Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the population whether or not entitled to participate, to go to the sports units participating in the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests for minors are carried out, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México West) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is achieved, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day is celebrated on November 14, he said the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary family history of diseases, with the purpose of avoiding risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
On Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure measurement, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetics are applied to all participants (it is sought to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez pointed out that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and in the case of girls, of 47 percent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise," said the IMSS specialist.
He said the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population differs from others because of its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and five percent African heritage and this condition is reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect if they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (cantoses) on the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes that must be made to prevent disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying in front of the TV most of the day and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, that is, the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, burger, etc.) with high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid bumps
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions.
If the signs sent by the pavement were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of a pavement could even be reduced by amount, or asphalts is the right,
In his lecture A technological opinion of the potholes, issued in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he revealed that the laboratory in charge develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The CF researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt binder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that make up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
By moving vehicles and generating efforts, it allows forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
Over the asphalt binder, abounded, is placed a last layer called rolling binder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it should have more mechanical strength than the asphalt folder and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the efforts, the treadmill also requires having the appropriate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt binder.
When the ground gets wet, the water diffuses inside the binder and it is difficult to get out, this causes a softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a bump, he said, the first to wear out is the rolling film and only then is the asphalt folder affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be taken care of at the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the pavement layers must always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied with, to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be done to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced that Melina Ramirez Serna did not reach the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms. Alju<0xC3><0xB1>a (1990), Ms.
Today, the big question many ask themselves is: What is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Se<0xC3><0xB1>orita Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why?" made by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the questioner the vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Nowadays I read Crime and Punishment, it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a most beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
A response that did not like first by the term "culturalize" and second by not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books that quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise happens what has to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses released it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist hinted that being the favorite, the cheerful and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craft costume, and Reina Madre), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and so it did not shine on the stage."
And that was noticed in her first swimsuit presentation at the Hilton Beach and her two parades at the coronation evening.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN’s “Like at Home” program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess “proves that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen.”
In addition, Valle showed himself to the latest very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
Two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for her defects in the back and fibrosis that was noticed in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queens trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very noticeable, she dropped points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the vallecaucana were the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong and here they charged her.”
For this prize, which for the first time gives the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in swimsuit, a cruel proclamation emerged that last night was fulfilled, since it was said that this was the container that Raymundo granted to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodged by the crown.
This was the work of the cale<0xC3><0xB1>o who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopicist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lophoscopicist from the CTI of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven loboscopes who work in the CTI section, that week it was the turn of "availability" for Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of El Chocó, where he often had to be interned for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the corpses that were to be identified were.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was leading the world’s oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to carry the decactylar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the corpse was located, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the card.
His eye did not fail: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n dactyloscopist from Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, that can become key in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, loboscopes support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present fake ballots or have no papers.
We take the fingerprint and search them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, it was up to him to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to take out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI typist explained that on the objects "the fingerprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes imprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
'Indignados' Defy Authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part of them followed the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square under a court order from where they were evicted in the morning and tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to re-camp on the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square again, we’re going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the “indignant” response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the “indignados” proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, while telling Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved to show support for the members of the movement and that it has tried to mediate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - is still closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed at this time copies of that court order and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, warning them, however, that local laws do not allow them to relocate with tents and sleeping bags.
The governor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the plaza because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of American workers than those of American workers," the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "disrespect for freedom of expression."
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests that began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", rescuer on "Baywatch", "Playboy" bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with “crooner” Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the TV show “It’s a Russell Peters Christmas” on December 1 giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a homemade porn video in which she appears along with her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a crib a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently hosted part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the fall spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe Japan has suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo Government's first estimates put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest pace of growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the rebound in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with the 0.9% decline in capital expenditure that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real revulsiveness of the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crises to strengthen - or rebuild - the infrastructure, to use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and turbid US forecasts, a privilege weighing like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the price of the yen.
As markets continue their siege on the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government remains on guard.
"We must be aware of the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
As it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone was even below the average, which is at level 100, precipitating eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again fuels doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums skyrocketing and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze leading to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections by the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday when opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his stance: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still chosen by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment unambiguously and as soon as possible".
Economics spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of $8 billion, although there is also no definitive date.
The Greek lure still has thread for a while.
Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights the "preponderant" place of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant position globally in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this intrusion of cooperation, whose "essence" indicated that lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with the 2015 horizon, and, "especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on a daily basis, with an income of less than one dolar".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate from the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges we face".
The Microcredit Summit raises itself not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to promote “two basic goals”.
His Majesty explained that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will rise from the poverty line in which they are immersed.
The momentum in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlights Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground his lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link to this project earned him yesterday the qualification of the "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "baker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Do<0xC3><0xB1>a Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for any democratic state.
In this regard, he explained that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredits are “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not let it fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people to whom all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, went without much difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the issue prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who consider that the government's policy is currently too little strict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with her speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, clear any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in one motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time has come to pave the way in Europe.”
This could manifest itself in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to allow the European Union to tighten its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble's idea.
Undoubtedly, it is unlikely that the 27 will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the European Central Bank directive against the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the mood within her party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither has she tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or countries in difficulty willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except for passing.
Two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon’s army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are launching an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts from the will to save rigorously, but still reminds of an axis of the presidential campaign of the right, most want to focus on sickness losses.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of default on private sector workers before they can take the cut.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on employees a day of absence without pay in case of unemployment (so far, they do not lack, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, the majority also put the issue of fraud back on the table, this time oriented towards the abuses of unemployment.
"The controls are going to increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is found to be committing a fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in the other cases, the effects of the announcement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of unemployment fraud.
In fact, this issue has been constantly monitored since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched, which have usually yielded fruit.
The French do not get sick any more than in the rest of Europe.
Let us look closely, first of all, at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), more than €237 million in unemployment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, unemployment benefits accounted for 5 per cent of healthcare expenditure in 2008, amounting to €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to sick leave, amounting to 6.2 billion euros.
2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professionally managed Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off sickness.
Another study, in this case of Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were considered to be " duly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, taking as a total 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly an insignificant figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent tax revenue losses of between €9 billion and €15 billion a year, that is, more than the total cost of casualty allowances and, undoubtedly, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday 14 November; he also added that the 100 days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this goal.
"In order to make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, since "it is at stake" the country's stay in the eurozone, he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “to around 9%” of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right-wing group, on Monday expressed support for measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with the members of his party "New Democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
Expert Committee Says Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide Must Be Legalized
Canadians live by denying death, Royal Society of Canada report says
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and medical.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is considering such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded in Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not agree with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with incompetent or consenting persons.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, since they believe it would allow people whose death is near to ease their suffering, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that no prosecution should be initiated against them.
Regarding the maintenance or interruption of health care for a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, they suggest that the Penal Code should state that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for the training of health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
“This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide,” said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, he adds that “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed “strong opposition” to the findings of the report, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, calls into question especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President El Asad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters demonstrated outside the Foreign Ministry building yesterday.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria was intensified, which, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “plot” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union has stepped up sanctions against Damascus, while Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan have spoken out in favour of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime’s forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," Jordan's king told the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has lamented that the mediation efforts that Turkey has been making since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country that Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance on.
In the wake of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "reinforced consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to repression in Syria, said State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have already lost their lives in the southern Syrian region of Deraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) has announced.
Two other civilians have died "during shelling and shooting with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the country is "moving towards the end of the crisis".
In addition, it has reacted firmly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his functions, which in his opinion is "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not weaken,” he added, assuring that “plots plotted against Syria will fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he believes is “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finalize the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on 2 November, which envisages, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said yesterday that the Arab League’s decision was “inaccurate”, while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italia
Monti asks for time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the president-designate.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its program, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that the markets will have patience and will understand it."
His appointment by the President initially gained the approval of the markets, but later he became concerned, particularly after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister-designate should create a team primarily made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government should function until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he believes.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work with urgency in mind and with the aim of "regaining its prominence" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
Italy's "boss of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see her as mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can't meet the deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put in some 200 billion euros in state bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by that UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Afterwards, he is believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as one member state has informed the Agency, worked for most of his career in such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"Following a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have increased again," Human Rights First said, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant," the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, an official with the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses,” he added, adding that such efforts could include an improvement in police reporting on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, causing its service to look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to follow more readably and live the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This lets you know if messages are being tracked, if new accounts are being subscribed, if a message is being favorited, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading it to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another persona, followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the consumer networks Facebook and Google+.
On the net, users have debated the interest of this innovation with "tweets" with different opinions.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it’s too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature is going to help me better follow some elements of my Twitter feed,” writes <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria (disambiguation)
Introducing a “Golden Rule” in the Constitution
The ruling Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic government in Austria on Tuesday decided to include in the constitution a “golden rule” to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria’s sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure much higher than the maximum limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, the Christian Democratic Vice-Chancellor for Foreign Affairs.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro area on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law of equivalent value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian government approximates the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rules".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit is expected to decline by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal state’s structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would step in again to mark the change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the all-time highs produced by the intervention of the Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been rising steadily since then, driven by purchases from investors who see it as a “worthy haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar went back under 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to what prompted the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion in the Japanese currency is damaging to the archipelago’s exports, as it increases the value of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues obtained by Japanese companies when they convert them to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northeastern region of Tohoku, Noda said, fearing that the yen's escalation will cut the weak recovery.
The world’s third largest economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (up 1.5% from the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considers that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” hinting that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasuries by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros).
Euro area:
the guys grow, the bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, European stocks are sinking a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o’clock, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and stood at 3,064 points.
The Dax lost 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
“Given the new tensions regarding loan yields from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing concerns from market regulators about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place within a narrow margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 o’clock, the European currency was worth $1,3570, a 0.4% drop.
According to the corridors, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option for a struggling country to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same term offered 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the countries of the south, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of regulators.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks being suffocated by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, has stated that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on October 27 would be the "main work" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
From a statistical point of view, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a more favorable figure than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is an issue that cannot be addressed taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The discussion will only be useful if it considers the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic evolution will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources must be alleviated in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
That is not the case either in Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which is solely intended to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are moving forward with their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality goes against such discourse.
The election of Berlin will mean an increase in the price of electricity, a greater dependence on energy due to the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the detrimental effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be meditated on.
European champion in the wind sector, from which he gets 30% of his electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear power would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not manifest opposition in principle to this type of energy, the polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets that can create non-offshore jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years, when its manufacturer is expected to collapse?
To solve the equation of nuclear power, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, nor is there a diabolical source.
Areva’s development of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewables, demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it caused no consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electric players who want to build a plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them freeway to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is, on this issue, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take over all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande merely includes banalities, indicating that co-development will solve the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may prove electorally profitable, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work that summarizes the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries they receive.
The limitation of immigration weakens growth and impairs employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for wage cuts.
But experience has shown that immigrants are actually more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in sectors with a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows represents a rise in long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income less expenses) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points he was missing "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, all it needs to do is think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would suffice to vote in the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little One", that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to turn into a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be considered in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly manner.
A blank signature on the absolute European monarch or a cessation of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to have blows of effect, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that conforms to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, that suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is for popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and would lead us to a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The interest-driven revolution would not suffice.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To build Europe, let’s make Europeans.
Cards with "contactless" chips become generalized
The world chip card show kicks off Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations of the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is that of contactless technology, which allows to pay for public transport or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share is expected to increase further in 2012 (an estimated 580 million units) and account for close to 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
About 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But large stores work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To get the upper gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed themselves to systematically disseminate contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is essential for carrying out transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, which has long been suspected, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already “has the certainty.”
“The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating,” he said, without giving further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the runways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such “supports” had become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex and styled suicide bombers or explosive devices used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as an uninteresting enlightened community.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants are engaged in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya’s reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed an attack that caused 80 deaths in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, in particular the police’s protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would extend from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria, is a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to “share all the information.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more blunt statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican stronghold.
The often unfounded slogans spread over China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Grand Old Party nomination race, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them “for manipulation of their currency,” a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that "swallows" emotions.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who gets stuck in the depths of the surveys, remains inaudible.
In the style of Reagan
Romney has also pledged military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I will stop Iran,” he boasted.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second-highest-ranked candidate, for his part shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, he urged to counter the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability," apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty exit of the “boys” from Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The population judges Obama’s national security record rather positively, which wiped out bin Laden.
From Iraq, he distrusted the military interventions that generated a sinking.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
The Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia via the Baltic Sea bottom, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the opening of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that communicates directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his counterpart from the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western Europe network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will reach Western Europe each year through a first had of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this enormous work presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land travel by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy, gas-consuming Western countries with increasingly limited reserves.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically,” Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon said at the opening of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which major gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All of this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect it against ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at an average of 200 m depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to implement measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but project leaders renounced it when they saw that the Swedes were not too willing to allow a Russian state company to settle permanently in the sea off their shores.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of leakage, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But the builders consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, as they have foreseen joints that are predicted to have a leak every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is ensured simply by the pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is especially favorable.
Gazprom then leased to that company, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all gas transport capacities.
“Gazprom will pay you for the full capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,” says Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been carried out in 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and in 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the project is expected to reach €7.4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are certain that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet gate.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
As of Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as if aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted an old and forgotten object to today's taste, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed, is far away.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, as the notebook appeals to both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at the beginning, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Discouraging?
"No," says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable.
At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
It should be noted that disabled unemployed people continue to face numerous barriers to accessing employment.
They usually have an older age: 37% are over 50 years old (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with an average of 38%.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "are the crux of the problem", says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association noted that the directors surveyed have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities,” with “overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually impaired.”
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are far from the target of hiring 6% disabled workers, a target that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated great pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, particularly among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens are not hiding the pleasure of this friendly game.
We will not dare to say that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker's gesture of grudge against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for her being Belgian.”
"I want to move forward," the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations on his team and in the selection, "it's a set", it has been justified.
“In Lille, I’m all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
"I have to sit down."
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not to mention “pleasure.”
He has been cheering the Blues since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
Without a doubt, this will especially reinforce the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he recalls.
“We just faced it recently.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made a reference to “pride.”
"Pride" for playing "a gala game."
"Pride" also to check, as "neighbor", that France "returns to being a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento’s Portugal faces with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first game, both teams were lacking realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selection, which he has run since September 2010, is going to qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is one game to play and one rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the one-way game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but could not score the valuable goal that would have given him peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home."
But at home, in the luminous Estadio de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be just as enthusiastic, even if it is clear that the party "is very equal", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
“We hope the match is very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor, however, has relativized.
Friday’s draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, although they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home," Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has great technical quality and players with great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, as long as it’s realistic this time.
