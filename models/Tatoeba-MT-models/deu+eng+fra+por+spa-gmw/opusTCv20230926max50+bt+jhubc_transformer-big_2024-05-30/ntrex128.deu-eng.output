Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament) is a dismay.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions fear becoming the target of mockery.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name rhymes with “Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru party said that the entire group was “not happy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law for the name changes, said: "The final decision on the names for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which gave broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
Regarding the title of Members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs preferred, while the MWP option received the greatest support during a public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle for a consensus for chairman Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill within weeks, could be a problem.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualifying National Assembly members and shaping the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Voters on Sunday will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim to Greek territory arises, and has repeatedly spoken out against its admission to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the popular vote on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said there was a bar and a church at every corner in the past,” Adams said.
“There is no longer both of them today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives are different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
At the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not go as long as the church leaders assume, and that they “will sooner or later be at the beginning again.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the bell-play.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bells as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who rang the bell in July, used other words: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell-play by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell-play at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story of architects and contractors who have been drawn in part by the lay leaders of the Church and partly by the Diocese of Bishops.
In July, the municipal council – the community’s governing body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipal council, although it had not been involved in the assignment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Shark Injured in California Diving to Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving to Lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled with several others to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, “I’ve been bitten!
I’ve been bitten!”
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire keybone had been torn open.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area, but it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic upper body injuries.
For investigation and security reasons, officials blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to launch cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s attacks boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with department store-like cosmetics departments staffed with specialized assistants.
As part of a large-scale push to the UK’s 2.8 billion pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in eleven stores nationwide and, if successful, will be expanded to additional stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetics offering doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boots.
In addition, the supermarket is launching a relaunch of its “Boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing at two Sainsbury’s outlets, with the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and a second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since purchasing Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has established hundreds of Argos outlets and a number of Habitat outlets, increasing food sales and profitability.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, which ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the drugstore's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds will play a role in the plan to the extent that an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy will be added to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have reshaped the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to suit all needs, and due to the enticing environment and favourable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases, which challenges the way we used to shop."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “angry” after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound UK business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The two’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old “This Morning” host announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones for her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "angry" when the "Golden Girl" of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to their new businesses - worth up to 1.5 million British pounds - the joint homewear and accessory brand was truly unable to devote enough time.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain en route to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure for them their future over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the market launch.
In the Marlow headquarters, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” presenter, who is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend the holiday together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV show “I’m A Celebrity”.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t comment on his business affairs.”
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive remarks about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was lauded by Trump as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
However, denuclearisation negotiations have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leaders from around the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was sticking to sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, costing hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international support, so this is a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the civil protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international agencies should participate in the relief measures.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country remains unfortunately ill-prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not an everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite a warning coming into force, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is a challenge in the best case scenario.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign and has spent ample money on roads and railways.
However, Joko’s government, which is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding shortfalls.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from continuing denominational tensions in Indonesia, and members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scores a deep equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute ahead of a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri with a 0:1 draw from his team, about 27 metres away from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball, players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw edge coming and had contact with the ball, I didn’t think about it too much and just took the shot.”
Chelsea led in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard at halftime with 1-0.
The blues striker gave Mateo a pass with his heel back, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and shot Liverpool's Alisson Becker to the left behind in the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Videoton on Thursday at 15:00 in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the civil protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that had been brought down by Friday’s 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which caused waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was overgrown with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
After a female body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken in something with a dashcam, to contact us and they may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s nearest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours before they can re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She keeps saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the barricade and another vehicle was in front of the barricade.
Within the barricade were several police officers who monitored the apartment block.
Individuals with information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to the September 30 protocol entry 247.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-reminiscent destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art products by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue was targeted in front of the Palace of Westminster.
The image storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, as someone who defended parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
Certainly, the conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation in the mid-17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering.”
Killer pig bites Chinese farmer dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southwestern China by a pig.
The man, whose surname was only "Yuan", was found dead near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reportedly on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a neighboring pig farm.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on his nose in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighing 250 kilos had bitten the farmers dead.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, whose surname was called Wu, was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on more people as police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, suffering serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 290 kilos clamped a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare away the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They’re just playful.
They like to twist and are very curious ... they are not out to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Bring Widespread Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening on the way across the colder waters on Mexico’s north coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast Time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough is starting to form over the Pacific, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture in the coming days generates through interactions with the incoming trough widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall can cause dangerous flood-like floods, water-driving debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, rainfall of up to 5 to 10 centimeters is expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become ripping streams, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts as well as wind that carries dust.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of Southern California’s coast.
Total precipitation volumes of more than one centimetre are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris drifting in water and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
Heavy rain falls throughout the Four Corners region on Tuesday and lasts for Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12oC.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
A warm start to October with widespread temperatures around 27oC is expected for much of the middle and east of the United States from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers on Thursday saw the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, and the television stations on Friday interrupted their regular program over a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona that the FBI is to conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was 100% sure Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had bullied her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company measured the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds roughly to the spectator numbers at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained strong after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS as protesters loudly pressed him in the elevator on the way to a court hearing.
The scene was broadcast live on CNN, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement, adding before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live hours later when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on forwarding Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI, as demanded by the Democratic minority, investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week.
Flake was persuaded by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes for Kavanaugh’s confirmation without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In a separate interview with her published on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that calls for the mutual collection of tariffs by Britain and the EU “completely absurd.”
Deadly Shots at Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson in Relation to LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
After an interview with Simpsons, police said he confessed to the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Criminal Laboratories, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “their diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball team.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shaken” by Wayde’s death and “is in shock.”
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash at Mexico City.
The ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had increased and 183 gas and ashes emitted within 24 hours.
The agency monitored numerous cases of grumbling and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windscreens of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity at the volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the standby police, threw eggs and also threw powder of color, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
Over the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No forgetting, no forgiving,” while Unionists cried out “Long live Spain.”
According to the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which was seen by Madrid as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had voted with an overwhelming majority for independence, although turnout was low as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes outside polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outside Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he no longer sees the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they were able to vote, but now we are hanging tight,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties this year struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention, waiting for their trials for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry was rammed several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
He may have been shot at the car with a crossbow.
Menga hit means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
Livingston FC surprised the Rangers, leading to Steven Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas hit proved crucial to Gary Holt's second-half team matching Hibernian.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premier League this season without a away win and will face the Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston is in the meantime able to increase his winning streak in the division to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn’t lost since taking over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against cheering guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the goal, as his directness confronted the Rangers with a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, so Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he sank in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a shot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in the shot position together, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but could not overcome the hosts' defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely undisturbed.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow squeezed the ball from another standard Livingston situation.
Flanks repeatedly entered the Livingston penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger range, while two requested penalties – one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one for handplay – were denied.
“Phänomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Her playing style and her team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has shaken the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on the go throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s kind of like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reactions in Cologne
Smiling faces and blue skies prevailed on Saturday (September 29) when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was to serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for keeping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reviled by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British daylight saving time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, who died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in a driver-flight accident on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday's accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roadblocks and diversions for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. UK summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still going on.
Specialized Tornado officials were called in to end the riots involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officers were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars.”
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was treated in hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, police officers were summoned to the prison to take action against serious riots in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Flood-like Floods (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert-ridden southwest and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to 320 kilometers as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall with occasional rainfall of up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and sometimes up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, some of this rain is likely to be useful, as there is currently drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and will weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall totals of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, up to 25 centimetres possible,” weather.com reported.
Subsequently, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north over Mexico, reach the border with Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The main danger associated with Rosa or its remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-ridden southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and water-driving debris are expected in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Following the discovery of a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone with records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the filth, the rage” of Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “from the foulness, the anger” of Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and dismissed the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also said at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in service to the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t do it, but in reality I do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats see their mission as “to resist and block.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, death toll rises
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of them being flooded when gigantic waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a party on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when at dusk waves up to six meters high hit the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the threat from the tsunami came yesterday, people were still following their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian civil protection agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it swamped cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive quake was equivalent to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugroho, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency was repeatedly criticized for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official information.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately warning people on the street below him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall crashes onto the shore and floods buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that disrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities with support, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and was only reopened for relief.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Doseba, they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
“They said they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even as the relief groups began with the hard task of starting disaster relief, some argued that skilled foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the location of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
“At the moment, it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
As the second night since the earthquake and tsunami fell over Palu on Friday, friends and family members of those still missing hoped for one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa hotel were, as Mandagi added, his pupils.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, instead of blue checkmarks, only led to grey question marks.
“I think that means the news wasn’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole a Brink’s employee from filling a cash machine with $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to replenish more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons with information on the identity of the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has, in its own words, a religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only became ‘yes’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West previously worked, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to never use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students in his country looms.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people, while left-wing student movements were on the way to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training provided young people with criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased AI activity, the U.S. should double its spending on AI research, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the U.S., we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player, later serving as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes away the top academic forces, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people with a doctorate should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and academia are to be involved, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month that it will invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has happened to US laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this entitlement to Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that the turnout reached the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you for membership of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their vote.
“I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of the country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a raised head, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a “yes” outcome would be a “confirmation of our future”.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defence in the 2-0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders at the edge of the Brighton penitentiary.
He then shot a pass to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero struggles with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We had talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal right now.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League duel.
The goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Joker wants to ruin the Rockies' game
Since the Nationals left the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the always-willing joker hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“While we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw, as we know the atmosphere among the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why don’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokers throw in such a situation.
Joker, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander this season has a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation in connection with Brett Kavanaugh, whom he had chosen for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones — I don’t run, but in reality I run, so I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, you see the filth, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to ride over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as “making resistance and blocking.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud shouts in the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had risen vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the reprimand for having held a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “the meetings should involve everyone and be productive.”
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendly, gentler' policy has long since been forgotten, even if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
Colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared similar political views were now expecting me to turn around and take positions I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – no matter what I say – there follows a mockery on social media calling for my removal, denouncing the political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
With this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues, who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and yet never give in small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer apply all opinions, and with every motion for suspicion and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to move my head in and not to express my opinion so clearly, then I would "have no problems".
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which caused my classroom in the general school to literally fall apart, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need them most – as city councillors as well as as cabinet ministers.
I never took a hold of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and about areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say this: Given the fact that the country will be rushing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I do not send this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that even so many de-election threats or political purposeful thinking will not prevent me from acting in the best interest of all of you in my opinion.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result a bit, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tenntent’s Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve taken better advantage of their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was elevated by Frazier Climo, led Ayr, however, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempted for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot caught a non-elevated attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a hit right at halftime and then scoring an elevated attempt on the solo, so it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose started the second half, however, well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was elevated by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
After a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was borne by the field, Ayr expanded his lead by an increased attempt by Climo by Stafford McDowall.
Then Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the additional man pay through a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalties from behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
'Still Game' star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a switch to the hospitality industry after it turned out he was named as the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
A blue flag is flying on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Regaining it is a duty.”
Everywhere in Bolivia, enclosed by land, the memory of the stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment by the International Court of Justice to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will be pursuing the IGH’s verdict on large screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s demand, under which Chile, after decades of sporadic talks, is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial fight for his re-election next year, much is also at stake in Monday’s verdict.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The Netherlands-based UN body is not authorized to assign Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was already in place six months after the closing pleading, suggesting that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also be a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken the issue of access to the sea into its own hands,” Zarate said.
She suggested that Morales' warlike rhetoric had suffocated any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and “an opportunity to put an end to the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is a chance to realize that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting the stuck nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri called the notion that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North to its knees “brain-spinning.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris will showcase the latest collections of huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased on the catwalk a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide rim that almost squeezed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include jewel-set watermelons, a wizard’s hat and even a pineapple, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colour-loving masks were fitted with sewn-on lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice pack.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter wide rim, which they all wear from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another big creation over the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit-wearing model holding the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that big hats and beach bags will be available on the shopping streets next summer. The designer has generated so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only supported by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sports, art, music and other community-based enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that languages with the highest pass rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A on the higher exams.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A on the higher exams, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for job vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language by a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages that are considered the most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet known.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely only play a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked after training about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason game plan.
“I don’t need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of campaign rallies.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies planned for next week, including in well-meaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Faced with the hovering vote to confirm his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted in a tense atmosphere this week, with the expected Senate vote on confirmation hanging for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies over the next week will serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could be attended by supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and report to the media from Pittsburgh.”
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the recent West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come and try to give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Combat Readiness to Maintain Hope for Singles on Sunday
After three unilateral rounds, the four-man games on Saturday afternoon might have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum as a sport concept is a pure invention, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now it's four, so I think that means a little momentum for us," Jordan Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe is of course in the lead and is four points ahead, with twelve more to follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can score three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from teeing to green and is leading by example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm became louder in the further course of his round as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had retreated after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry, suggesting that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really need to get down on my knees and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, undoubtedly making the Ryder Cup history.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can't do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple who didn’t beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey’s on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the exuberant crowd underscores that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
To speak of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-person hero who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede in a clutch that they could not nearly overcome.
No one can help them out on Sunday.
The pairings of fours and fours are so fascinating to look up close due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or not give, and the way a strategy can change lightning-fast.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the team of the USA is ready to fight, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe leads the final day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is 10:6 ahead of the U.S. after Saturday’s four and four games and is ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Ingeniously playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, scoring four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, which wants to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fours in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four games, the USA made more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were christened "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the decayed Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had towed himself through two matches on Saturday, had his brilliance flashed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning four, returned to play the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their expectations.
Triple-major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win in the fours over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a four-point gap, but as a title holder, Furyk's team will have a draw to keep the trophy.
After only being in second place for two days, it does not look like they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that last year North Korea took “essential measures out of goodwill,” for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to not multiplying nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see a response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri relied on North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which he pledged to work towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes calls for a loosening of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'first denuclearization' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even against the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a whim of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not respond to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the denuclearization issue instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech differed enormously from his speech last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the mainland of the United States with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened North Korea's "complete destruction" last year, overcrowded Kim at the United Nations with praise for his courage in disarmament steps, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea's denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have reached complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry up Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, when he left Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made only hours later to be accused by North Korea of making “gangster-like demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to dismantle a missile base and nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” sought were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all elementary school students get more sleep this year, a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often needless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and in his opinion is the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
"No one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the picture of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Subsequently, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine using a map of the university grounds with interactive symbols.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know this – just like you have a right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” Czeisler said.
The pride in pushing a “night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring enough good sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and fears, he said, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, who had taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar program of study before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should set up an alarm clock for bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the damaging effects of “blue light” emanating from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can get the circadian rhythm off the beat, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrard's players
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's divisive team meant a 0:1 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away win since the 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard the first second loss in 18 games as a manager, leaving his team eight points behind the leading Hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership by far.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the low-inspired Rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who dropped a point from the Hearts last week, and would have to be thrilled as his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes when Menga led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot behind.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game looked more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos obviously thought he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not accept the Colombian’s complaints.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s 34th-minute hit may not match the game’s course, it’s not to be denied that they earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a ball shot by Jacobs for a long time in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and picked Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard traded at halftime and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change was almost immediately effective when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they deserved, with Lithgow and Halkett getting one long ball at a time.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and repelled Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
Rangers swap player Glenn Middleton also called for a late penalty kick after a mob with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geigerzähler
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning"-Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “In fact, I hear a cracking!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” decayed cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy decayed cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to detect degenerated cells.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" the HER2 protein common to many cancers, and then re-injects the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump show after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap (“Make America Great Again”).
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he widely praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After sung his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” wearing a make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with an insulting cannonade against the Democrats, emphasizing once again his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Mockingjay was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of his headgear.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said, “I’m going to wear my Supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered buhrufe from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported, one person told the magazine: "It became deadly in the studio."
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU THAT YOU HAPPENED TO THE MASS.”
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted, however, that West is simply himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "The Being Formally Known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Prosecution for attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was wounded with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday in court.
The accusations are reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the swinging sword Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen would often make boys feel like they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who also appeared in Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was "very important".
“I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men in relation to the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embody that particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
There was clearly something wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones" and that he had "enough battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be seen in a remake of Sam Shepard’s “True West,” the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I got to know my wife on this show, so that’s how I’ve preserved my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the mistress of Harington’s character Jon Snow.
The two married on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, transmission occurred in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked GOP senators’ data, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, on Saturday denied claims that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MPs’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat expressed the view that the claims were being spread by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more heinous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is said to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online Thursday during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The release took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions was associated with Waters’ office, and released the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement prompted quick online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they haven’t done shouldn’t be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the motives of the Prosecutor.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Butcher seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English – You only live three times – Weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film, and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English - The Spy Who Sipped It" and resurrected in 2011 with "Johnny English - Now Especially" stuttering.
Will an ironic self-parody on how obviously silly we are become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the gloomy, grimace-cutting and incompetent Johnny English has been extended for the second time, signaling more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for moviegoers in the non-English-speaking world.
Of course, he is once again the clunky secret agent who bizarrely thinks he is cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of some Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a clap of this guy who contributed a single note to the title tune of “The Hour of Victory” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly thronged his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to light, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" movie series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedic elements.
The humor seems to be directed more at children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes are not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gag in the role of the Bean.
The eternally current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the displeasure of the on-duty agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and oppressed figure who is already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with
Their intelligence advisers inform them that all active spies have been unmasked and must therefore bring them out of retirement.
This includes the toll-fated Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but unofficially teaches in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of Her Majesty always do everything horribly wrong, are back in action, while encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister finds herself dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque jokes: Disguised as waiters, they set a chic French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos as they smuggle aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as nice and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly lives up to his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan whereby the British will work four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution to workers in the form of an additional day off.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea “fits” the party’s economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of workers, as well as the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised during the general election campaign 2017 the introduction of a 4-day week.
However, the approach is currently not generally endorsed by the Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not about party politics and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” from public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water utilities may not get their full share back, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and establish Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who collect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in the 60 Minutes news magazine on whether the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s results could affect Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring anything to light that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the court that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is certain about Brett Kavanaugh, and there should be a bomb going off,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those who called her could not confirm it.”
It's been 36 years now.
And I can’t see any changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will be attending the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the 7th time this year, not only to witness the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international stakeholder group that seeks to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, including volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (via email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – fighting poverty.
How successful is the project when you consider that Global Citizen has 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of putting forward a cool free concert a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you’re going to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen said that since 2011, the project has achieved more than 19 million actions by its supporters and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to support children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with $35 million, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and strenuous journey with ups and downs.
But similar to the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to perform at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as presenters.
U.S. could use navy to block Russian energy exports
According to Washington Examine, if necessary, Washington can resort to the navy so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets, and Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the legitimate government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is negotiating new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to address this.
“The United States can work with the navy to ensure that the waterways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the power from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as the "voice of the power consumers" in the US.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while calling Russia a “One Trick Pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration was expanding liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth $11 billion, which is set to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received headwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the board of directors of the BDI, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine” a 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine” a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren’s criticism of Donald Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has not taken a page in front of her mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation is required before voting.
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favor of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump-Ralley on the post-traumatic stress disorder under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, other families can feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they are coming back changed, that they are coming back more brewed, that they are coming back and wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support appeal to new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-against-Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, nations struggling with major problems of criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s expert statement said.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that denies immigrants access to the country adversely affects the U.S. economy, as immigrants could be more likely to act as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asyl exists for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or out of fear due to race, religion, nationality or affiliation with a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to alleviate all problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as race death toll doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son at a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance arrives with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soaked possessions while recovering everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients in the outdoor area were treated for the ongoing heavy aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was stuck under the fallen walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital of Beijing of exploiting the American press for proganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily on the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, last Wednesday after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an indictment that China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections are in line with U.S. officials’ message to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run ads to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China on a large scale, said Beijing has harmed workers, owners of farms and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, is now doubling this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming America’s proven tradition of free speech and the independent press by posting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only a limited number of opposing voices at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, and you will find no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans squeeze voters into midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, which could be from women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they are continuing with a vote.
“Such things can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School The Hill, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation is enough to appease annoyed voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. daily.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate hallway shouted “November is coming!” when Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to stick to Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer for the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for suburban voters and younger voters, people between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing their allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers pointed out that a backlash could be the result if Republicans advance confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
“It’s not just about the board’s vote, the final vote, or Kavanaugh’s review; it’s also about the way Republicans dealt with it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democratic election, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be at odds with who they should believe based on the statements made by Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his statement, while 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford made an affidavit to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was attacked by drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans the launch of a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
“We need to be active now,” he said about startup.
“This is an historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate sectors.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal empowerment and development through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company deploys resources, processes, and related skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a few developers who have been hired to work on this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether a comprehensive change will be made that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is tasked with providing commercial power generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroism for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire, leading the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before rushing forward with a field weapon alone and shutting down three of the military units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he placed a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he feels very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero becomes visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed up all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the spectators in the United Kingdom were not unhappy when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after waking up until the early hours of the morning, especially to see the fight.
One fan on Twitter described the move to the cartoon character as a kind of bad joke.
“Based on a regulation by the government, this content is classified as non-juvenile, so it had to be switched to a children’s broadcast at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said the company will work on the schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could be solved by the replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with viewers in the UK, and we won’t resolve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But let's stay tuned.
There was a lot of communication during the change, it was very messy and everything was not always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed that it was a technical issue.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise this won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 fights instead of the usual 6 fights, and we’ve tried to give fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is pretty unfortunate.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘inferior’ to sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper at various Olympic Games, says he has grown up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling has motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized in high school that he is different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, winning the Olympics is no longer so important to him.
The actual host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, he said he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, as love for boys and girls was completely socially unacceptable.
He said, “To this day, the feeling of being inferior to others and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he had expressed himself on this issue because he is fortunately able to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The discovery of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference was never an issue.
He says that if you had to go through so much as a child and teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died three years later from cancer, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley says his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his jackpot.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be at the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew it’s always been my dream to dive in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics – that was insane,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this, listening to the song in the run-up to the Olympic Games and still making goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to do a lot of work so that the whole thing does not turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that plague him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore not an ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the course itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson will meet perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, teaming up with tournament novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans lag behind with four points in the 12 singles games, Mickelson’s game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world’s most famous personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he would be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went now and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup run that never quite matched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson had 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit this week and it was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses."
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows the lead may be over soon
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead in the last singles matches in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just over the finish line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that’s just scarce,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured in the photo), after seeing the 5-3 win of the Class of 2018 on both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it’s not over.
It's going to be all right tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the dots are on the display board.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that is where our focus is.
“I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re completely clear on what’s in front of us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Rejoicing at the performance his players have achieved on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush that.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner if things are going well, but if you’re out there alone, you’re tested to the limits of your golfing skills.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament, standing on the winning side in Brookline before standing on the losing side after Europe's "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to detract from the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We put up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to conjure up tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of catching up, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the rankings.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German navy should have been put into service as early as 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but it will not be delivered until next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, according to local media.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by troubling problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and sea-target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods, and it should be possible that the latest frigates will not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships that are to represent Germany as a naval power are already obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The F125, which was followed by the accident, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to performance losses and preventing the navy from carrying out armament measures in the future.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the cost increased to a stunning €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in the face of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s military commissioner, confirmed that the navy “will run out of operational ships”.
Bartels said the problem grew larger over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In a farm in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as the brown long ear and waterfowl mice at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the bats’ activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all shots by experts, the frequency of bat exclamations is determined and which species does what.
Subsequently, a map and report of the habitat is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to preserve forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat stocks in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a risk, as can fly catchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes because of their nocturnal hunting habits when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out checks, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats yet, so we're doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stresses the importance of initially excluding bats from being present before maintenance work on the goods, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nesting place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and exterminate the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of rape against him “fake news” and said people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence over the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after they were released.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said on camera.
“You want to make your mark by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the Spiegel over the allegations they called “inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damages at an amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is presumably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos taken of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to rescind the agreement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, switching to Italian giant Juve in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK would ‘perpetually regret’ the loss of automakers
The United Kingdom would “perpetually regret” losing its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He said it was "concerning" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby should Britain leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will see production stops at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to automakers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, meaning that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU to produce the cars on order.
Should the UK leave the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders that could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts, according to the industry.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain stocks at the Derbyshire plant that would be longer than a day, the company said, explaining why production had to be interrupted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such border controls.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal, which, as I said, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be interrupted, but in the long run it warned that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at work, explained that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s key meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred by another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein has been overseeing the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who is investigating the interference in elections by Russia, ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, as well as a possible judicial impediment by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and impeaching the president with the help of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday as new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid colliding with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set, but it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
That will show, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences did not result in an aversion to the TV reporters' "effect-hashing", but admitted: "I would not deny that they are effect-hashing."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him," she said, without providing any precise evidence: "We looked at these numbers."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, however, “when the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot, and you have seen that we have done that a lot in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, perhaps the president showed why this is so when he made a run-of-the-mill and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS workers over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from abroad working in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and the desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, UK-EU exit negotiations continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, thus benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency head injury surgery
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery, according to Tennessee State’s Mike Organ, after a head injury he suffered in Saturday’s 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher and transported away for further investigations.
A spokesperson for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the injury are yet known” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the UK
Foreign investors will have to levy a higher stamp tax on UK property purchases in the future, according to new plans by the Conservative Party for homeless people
This step is designed to stem the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May is announcing today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when buying property in the UK, with the extra income to benefit the homeless.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, promising to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue will be fed into the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties leased for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the step to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK investors, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of holding up real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to abandon quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “housing shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking set of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price commitment to a ban on evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councillors more powers to build new homes.
“Last year, I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life for themselves.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy property as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too far away for too many people, and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be too big a problem.”
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his “greatest goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in the League One and lacking three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child I often watched Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he wasn’t afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success will be measured for me at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and the possibilities in this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross can have a management career of only three years, after a phase as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the margin of the relegation to winning the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more so than playing games.
It sounds weird because I wasn’t doing bad things, was able to live on it well and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
Playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through in terms of the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30th between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave has missed a boom in revenue from Britain’s crumbling pubs, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pubs and bar companies recorded 2.7 percent revenue growth in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, which compiled the figures, said: “Permanent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, in which pubs saw revenue increases of 2.8 percent, but the restaurant hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with an area-adjusted turnover trend that rose higher than it sank at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s Recreation and Catering Analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A study shows that every fifth child, some as young as 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools found an increase in so-called "fake insta" pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" to show their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, a similarity to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main account” that they could show to their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools’ Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, named four Olympic gold medals his own and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, could not run after a temporary circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for breast pumps that compares mothers with cows causes excitement in the net
A manufacturer of breast pumps caused excitement in the net with an advertising clip, in which nursing mothers are compared to milking cows.
In order to launch the world's first low-noise portable breast pump on the market, consumer technology manufacturers Elvie released a not-too-serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like, “Yes, I milk, but you don’t see a cock on me” or “if you haven’t noticed, these are not udders but my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it impairs the “terror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows.
“Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken from them within a few days of birth.”
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Remarkably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don’t we use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another person added: “This is a non-reality advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a bit crazy, but I’m not trying to overinterpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use breast pumps (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone has danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use breast pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all the challenges that come with them, while presenting in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of interned migrant children is higher than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, including as heightened rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children in caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid of becoming the target of deportation themselves when they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to make their fingerprints and share that data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either a caregiver themselves or a member of a caregiver’s household are staying illegally in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to deal with the children’s cases faster, the officials introduced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will be videotaped and not appear in person to stand before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts.
Advocates say that these concerns will be heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child is having problems that are easier to overlook due to the size.
They also explained that it can intensify traumas that many of the children already suffer from if they are brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria Calls on US, French and Turkish ‘Occupation Forces’ to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that the foreign forces are being treated illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and are being treated accordingly.
“You must immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” by both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are hired against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return are in place and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” to prevent the refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, was an opportunity for political talks.
The Russia-Turkey deal aimed a broad-based offensive of Russia-backed Syrian forces at the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will be taken against jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-allied Nusra Front, which will “be wiped out”.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to the “revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, shouldn’t, as many liberal viewers presumably hope, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time”.
So far, there are no signs that the spectators are tired.
Since 2014, the best-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best time, up from 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the ratings to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an aged comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos is worth entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the abortion policy decision by Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families, and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen, when one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of a round of experts about Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to the Washington Post, a “clothing rich in self-esteem, dislike Daniel’s description”) or the effects of
I will never see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he’s doing feels like a reality show he’s introducing to you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pawn Shop,” about Trump’s rotating cast and daily twists (breaking a feud with the Football League NFL, Kim Jong-un praises).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get off the screen, not when judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were like, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the narrowest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th Electoral District is being flooded with donations, thanks to the new constituency boundaries that have resulted in two incumbents competing for the same seat.
The recently redrawn suburban district in Pittsburgh is taking on Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is competing against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were violated the Constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a swap of campaign funding between the parties’ big financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly regarded special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican, and Trump gained a 20 percent advantage there.
Politicians give the Democrats an easy lead.
The United States examined El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then backed away
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, it was only in the case of El Salvador that penalties were considered, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and was a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving toward the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made clear that they want the conference to take place, effectively ending the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance the government is giving to the assembly, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed on condition of anonymity to comment on the internal meetings.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible judicial impediment, for which there is now sufficient public evidence.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
Should the congressional majority change, Trump would be confronted with an organ that would hold him accountable, precisely at the time he is riding past to step back in front of voters; and possibly before a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we must make decisions that will influence how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d’état against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil's kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was above-eligible for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and falsehood?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, a long winter is ahead of us.
But I think we will not fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger.
“This was an important point for us because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could still have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is going to be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a tough game, as they scored a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can do that with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look ahead, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional nursing insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you own the money.
Execute your legal documents: Apply legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary power of attorney so that you have a familiar person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health care professionals meet your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid if you shouldn’t be able to.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication use or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so you’re ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that play a role; who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the drug treatment?”
Who will take care of the dog?

Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which took place around 02:30 British time, as an "arbitrary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a heavy earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll likely to rise.
Due to the outdated communication systems, aides were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, stretching over a stretch of coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
An estimated 299,200 people lived in the government district, an administrative unit below the province, in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 rocked southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 rocked one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and former vice-presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, impediment to reporting domestic violence and resistance to state power, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from an acquaintance when they wanted to call the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been levied.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he responded with “Not guilty, for sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three class A offences, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B lawlessness, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being tried in the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, impediment to reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-force quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks from the moment the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that claimed eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is charged with using a hired pickup from Home Depot for a terrorist attack in which he raced on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, while crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targeted" killed the eight of them and "consciously" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative court in Saipov filed a 22-point indictment that included eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as one charge of the use of force and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack calls for “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the accusers, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted two years before the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Party MP Calls for NIGEL FARAGE to Transfer Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest campaign within the framework of the Conference of the Tories.
The former party leader of Ukip said that politicians must “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge faced by May in reconciling her deeply divided party has been exacerbated by the participation of members of her party who are in favour of staying in the EU in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping her compromise plan Chequers on track despite attacks by Brexit proponents, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the counter-reactions, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and “chaos”.
Bone said at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “chequers belong on the trash.”
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed a peer and should have been assigned responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we’d be out there already,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added, “I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers is on the trash.”
He said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public eye, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued, “Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage said in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” if they are in the process of deceiving the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You can’t get away with that.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued, “I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country who helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest until we are an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists swung banners of the Tories Against Brexit Grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential candidacy closely” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for re-election for the Senate against Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She was the focus of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was their 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it would be time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.
Arrested after death shots on LSU players Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of Friday's fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the scene and possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre sim grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after his team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes stall orders would play a big role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost like leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the box first and had Hamilton hit traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box one lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly freed the inside to endure with the risk of two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back places of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day, as Valtteri did a great job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done an excellent job of getting a double win,” Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign rally on Saturday, insisting that she did not pass on the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not address Ford’s statement directly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the Senate’s actions show that people are “common, wicked and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and wicked and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and then say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... You published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein's letter of accusations against Kavanaugh was filed in July and was published in early September, but Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her denial did not seem to go well with the president, who said on Saturday night at the campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed that the Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to reclaim power by all means.
You see the meanness, the wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made Friday’s Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by a 5-3 win in the return game at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led early with two goals, following goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made up for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard matched Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third loss in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes of a pitch from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the pitch as Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to his equalizing goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead ahead of the half-time break as he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rematched with a power play match in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, then Nielsen secured his team the win with a fifth goal after just halfway through the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controller died after making sure hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after Sulawesi Island was hit by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could increase to several thousand, and the country’s civil protection authority said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase further, as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, saying in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia has already been hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it will not be able to say anything about the whereabouts of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in a stable state.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane through hip-deep water.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working nearby on improving a dock were rushing to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes of Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but none of them were Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the process of the night a woman was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday concluded its evidence in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of having exiled a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said he received location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford entered the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chamber’s death, Tellis was clearing their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and return to socially conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
New York nanny sues couple over dismissal after 'racist' text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was “still a black woman.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the litigation to “extortion.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she began her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOCH A BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending the message to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her fauxpas, the “embarrassed” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice dismissed and claimed that the open-minded African-American nanny had done a bad job and had expected her to have a Philippine instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the release and is claiming compensation for the $350 a day they were supposed to spend over six months for the job they were originally booked for, but without a contract, and for which they would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple dismissed the allegations of racism, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step as they feared Maurice after insulting them could no longer trust them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” his husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to an “extortion” and stated that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation”.
“You want to sue such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the litigation continues, the couple were quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our current knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she describes as "a very important family member".
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly subsided and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when it all came down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to tear myself down.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, went on board along with the other passengers, who did not notice anything of what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Sorrowing women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives in a suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son had a promising career as a chef and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s body was found after the suicide by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the maps “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be quiet, you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been together for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at a low point, and when the kids unpacked their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that she had to go through: “It’s breaking a huge hole in the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
"I thought if we could actually get something like that which he asked for, i.e. a time-limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little bit of agreement," Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would "break up" in the party-political standstill.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can only be traced back to the timing.
The midterm elections on November 6 are just five weeks away, and if the Republicans do poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush seized the phone to call senators and persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently houses 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equality of votes and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Koreans 'declined' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 overtakers were registered, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited stricter border controls between North Korea and China as the main factors, as well as higher prices for human smugglers.
Pyongyang did not speak out publicly.
The vast majority of North Koreans are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the outlaws to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks, which revolved around the discontinued denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, at which they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to first unilaterally disarm,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for Supreme Court office
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied any allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed fast and was about to burst into tears as he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated reputational murder” organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton’s lost 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves he could not serve on the Supreme Court because she shows he is biased toward Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way he went about the Clintons and the Democrats, he even declared himself unsuitable,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if he should be confirmed and Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current position as judge,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion ruling Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person to go to this court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she has developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, tell the person she said to, “You may think that I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was grabbed by the collar by an older woman, an undercooled manager, whom I was always a little afraid of, and dragged into a staircase.
“Never let her see that you’re crying,” she told me.
"They don't know you're stinking.
They think you’re sad and will be content with you because they think you’ve gone from the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidatures.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then resigned his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy herself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already advanced, she was behind in raising funds and vowed not to run if she didn’t raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, supported her campaign with only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced that she was not launching an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and address voters directly instead of delegates, as well as the anger over sexism that she was close to tears.
“You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have thought that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit from US-China Trade War
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a long-term ditch between countries, my experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed penalties on major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing hit back every time in the same way and recently raised tariffs of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to any U.S. move and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to relent would mean giving in, but a public buckling in on the U.S. would be far too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously realized,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for New American Security’s think tank focused on Asia.
Syria is ‘ready’ for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by the seven-year-old war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes aid in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sank his tee in the water on the 16th lane (par 3) and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europa, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have contributed,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods in the singles on Sunday 2:1.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, who I’ve been chasing on television since childhood.”
Woods lost all of his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup score of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have delivered high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make any of it.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
You have to take off the hat.
