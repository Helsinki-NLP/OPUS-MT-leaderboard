Fire cleared in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had erupted overnight on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 firefighting vehicles.
The fire could be stopped.
Neighbors were told not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory is owned by the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive, which is particularly strict.
Around 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already made headlines in the past - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped by a leak in 2013 and the surrounding area smelled widely of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, about 2,000 liters of petroleum oil flowed into the city’s sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search for 57 days after her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog, quitting her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. For 57 days, the bitch was missing all traces - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. You and her husband had left bitch Katie in the hotel room while they were going for dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked the dog.
In the hope that Katie could still be staying somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder had caused the dog to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog, but from days became weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"Tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man called and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly her bitch stood under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," she remembered that she was holding her entire vehicle, and "The people were crying out to us at the interfloily".
Losses in the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The whereabouts are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
The Bundeswehr has repeatedly lost weapons and ammunition - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the force has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 gun parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is according to a list classified as a covert item by the Federal Ministry of Defense, about which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two guns, one gun part and 3474 ammunition have reappeared. The still missing guns and gun parts include six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six pistols of the type 308 and two pistols of the type MG8.
The extent of arms and ammunition losses in the Bundeswehr was "frightening", said the left-wing MP Martina Renner. This was all the more so, since in the course of investigations hardly anything was found again. The left-wing politician Franco spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner also criticized the ammunition.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters, with the shipping company saying it wanted to wait for an official notification from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was charged on July 19 by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Seaway of Hormuz with violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary arrest of an Iranian oil tanker off the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil export is shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel Appreciates the Courage of the People in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the GDR regime at that time, Merkel said at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the impending day of German unity.
Musk sets extradition record
Tesla's quarter may hold a record, and despite a boom in deliveries, there have been recent losses at the electric car company.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter said, and the challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went off the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers will be required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Mystery solved: That’s why we can’t tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebral brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they communicated on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made in the question of why children are so fiercely resisting the tickling, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter even before touching, which is due to a layer deep in the brain that triggers laughter even when the tickling is expected.
According to the data, previous research has shown that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound range when they are tickled by humans. This "laugh" is mediated by the part of the cerebral cortex that serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter as well as the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex were suppressed during self-touch. This is also the case when the brains are intensified by the activity of the aliens.
But if the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time pass, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot tickle themselves, because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebral.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Accordingly, they sometimes aborted this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showed flight behavior or fear rigidity. This ambivalence was similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the tickling was a behavioral reaction that was the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Great fire cleared in French chemical plant
The large fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. The prefecture of Normandy told the AFP news agency on Friday. The fire had erupted overnight on Thursday.
According to authorities, no substances that are harmful to health should have been leaked. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in operation with about 200 fire trucks.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Residents were told not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The prime minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session of parliament on Wednesday evening after lifting the pause. The prime minister threatens to lead the country on October 31 without an EU deal if Brussels should not agree to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. How he wants to achieve this, however, is unclear.
On Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and reunite this country would have been to complete the EU withdrawal.” Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorial to Oslo and Utöya attacks unveiled
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead, a memorial in honor of the victims is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron replicas of roses. They recall the roses that had been laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in front of the Cathedral in Oslo.
Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud’s project will now be unveiled at the same location. The roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims. Among others, Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected to open.
Right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in Oslo’s government district on July 22, 2011, and then shot dead dozens of participants in a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party’s youth organization on the island of Utöya, killing a total of 77 people in the attacks.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to sink again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been held in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters, after being cleared by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to the shipping company Stena Bulk.
The Stena Impero has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now going to Dubai for medical examinations, said Chief of Shipping Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish TV station SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," the statement said.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on 19 July on the charge of having violated the regulations of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, said H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. They had been able to cope with the difficult and rubbing situation in the past ten weeks.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar after the arrest of the "Stena Impero": there at the beginning of July a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, was put in chain. The delivery, according to the authorities, violated EU sanctions against the country of war Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assumptions that it was a barter to get the "Stena Impero" released, London vehemently rejected.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been involved in the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tankers and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The US had stepped out of the international nuclear agreement in 2018 alone, which prevented Iran from building a nuclear bomb, while at the same time ending its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been exerting massive pressure on Iran to expand the leadership with Teheran.
Because of the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for the military protection of the merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Strait of Hormuz to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, with the “Coalition of Hope” initiative for the Persian Gulf, which aims to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protecting powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to the "war winner" of production. Given the global tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redispose of the U.S. financial leaders of Asian companies, who are considering moving their production from China to another country, as well as the U.S.S. government has made India one of the world's preferred alternatives.
But now India itself has come into Trump’s focus. Deprecating the White House’s “Kingdom of Tariffs,” America withdrew trade benefits for 2,000 products from the emerging market at the beginning of June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, and more spirits, and motors.
On the world map of trade wars, however, the frictions with India are merely a sideshow. In addition, America considers the world’s largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China’s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a salve of American penal tariffs against India is unlikely, so it is likely that the second term of India’s Prime Minister Narendra has taken place.
The problem, however, lies in a different place: the empirically corroborated thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development, has a serious state in the socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reform eagerness is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness, which in the multi-ethnic state for too long suffocated any entrepreneurial spirit and suffocating a high-level of energy.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, in India in the first five years, much has turned for the better. But in trade policy this does not apply. Inspired by this, to protect internationally uncompetitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi briefly clings to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well which vocabulary pleases Western managers. At the core, the "India First" advocacy has moved to their country's radically renewed economic policies, thanks to the Bharonist party.
Funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
Former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday in the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral was reported in the Parisian Invalidendom.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the athletic world championship
The top of the world was already in the finish line, when the cooled Khalifa International Stadium played heart-warming scenes. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He could hardly hold his legs well 300 meters before the finish line, ran in unhealthy bent posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo was still running half way to him with the finish line in the West African country.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he drew the attention of the assembled journalists completely unexpectedly. Shyly he first stepped out, did not want to talk at all about his heroism. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he had realized that this would be difficult, he would not have been proud to run for the world. And he was only supposed to help me to run out of the country.
He did so that evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he would have imagined. Because this heroism will remain in memory. Especially since Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this run. Using it all at the end of the world, it was exactly the help of the goal.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, had competed to set a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, this was achieved with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes before". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Next articleMilliards: Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their roadside controls and partly searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, there weren't any protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura by most of the men who came to the suburbs, but today the men who came to the suburbs for hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and maladministration. Such an outspoken protest against the political leadership there had not been in Egypt for years.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) said more than 2,000 arrests were reported. Independently, these figures were also not confirmed. The government initially confirmed the figures.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were also "arbitrarily arrested" "only because they were 'at the wrong time in the wrong place,'" HRW said, citing lawyers who were arrested. The allegations against the detainees range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association", but according to police in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: mail-order retailers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns end up in the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry said on a question from the Green Party, about which the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe reported on Friday, but traders could set the market value of the non-sales returns so low that they would have to pay no or very little sales tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - subsequently landed in the garbage. According to the current legal situation, donating them would cost the companies additional money, because the tax authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, on which then VAT is due.
Greens Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear that companies can’t rate products for sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on them not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to the construction market, but also to other businesses.
Banksy Art Auction: There has never been a better time to sell this painting
Streetart star Banksy’s Devolved Parliament will be auctioned off soon.
For Branczik, Banksy’s work highlights “the reversion of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude shaped by animals and tribes”. From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby’s in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had re-exposed the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "question hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday at the first sitting of the House of Commons after lifting a forced pause imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit already twice postponed on October 31, if necessary without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in south-eastern England, he painted a picture depicting a man shattering a star of the European flag with a chisel. The factory sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the United Kingdom every day.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in parliament, according to his top adviser, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “walk in the park,” Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. “We will enjoy it. We will leave [the EU].”
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament harshly in recent days, accusing them of “treason” to the people, accusing them of putting MPs at risk because they could be targeted by death threats, he dismissed as a “humbug”.
Cummings said the only way to bring peace is if MPs finally respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it’s not surprising that people were upset that Britain still hasn’t left the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the heated atmosphere on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should talk to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict during his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If this goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each rule part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had deprived the Indian Kashmir region of autonomy status, thus increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It lets fire with sharp ammunition on the population, more than 2,000 arrested join in prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there. Protesting in Egypt has never been safe. But since the seizure of power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisirat, a do all the times of the S-Sisi in 2013.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that the el-Sisi regime is not getting under control, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third of the population in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is at ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression of the streets, but also the biggest economic actor in the country. The military
Tüv-examinations in the terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
For two months, we checked whether the complex system network in the BER fire protection system works together. The operators are satisfied with the progress, but the Tüv is not yet ready at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv inspections at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, said Rainer Bretschneider, Chief of the Supervisory Board, after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still defects in the terminal to work out. "We have many detailed topics, but we do not have a real showstopper." He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of defects in power cables still have to be fixed; the TÜV wants to check them until February. "To create the conditions for the start of flight operation, intensive work must continue to be done to address the defects," it said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the plugs on which the cable tracks hang. The airport chief expects that this will be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the crossing to the train station under the terminal is still not working satisfactorily. The problems had led to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that shut down in a fire like a screen so that the smoke does not spread. They run too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there will be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Initially it was expected to go into operation in 2011. Since the beginning of construction in 2006, the costs have risen from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has risen significantly since then, those responsible are planning the expansion of the airport, which is why it is planned to take place in a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster will be joining Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on solid feet.
Chemnitz: Automata for drugs blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and for this he threw several vending machines into the air in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket vending machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
Police captured a 33-year-old German man after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the occurrence of explosive explosions in a unit with a particularly serious case of theft, conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-old".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his narcotics addiction with the loot." The bomber alone had blasted parking ticket machines on the street four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The automaton bomber is now in custody, and the police investigation is continuing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automaton blasts in Chemnitz and neighboring counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price struggle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press spokesman of Austrian Airlines to APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Viennese base of the Lufthansa airline Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. This will be taken over by the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesperson said. The flight times should be coordinated with connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub on the one hand and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "production company" for the group sister AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that manufactured by Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. The AUA terminal will no longer be used as the AUA flight number.
At Vienna Airport, a price battle has broken out after the Niki Pleite. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 planes next summer. The Irish low-cost airliner sends four Ryanair machines with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union as a bypass contract critiqued.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary's battle announcement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA Chairman Andreas Otto said on Friday: "We will remain number one at the site in five, six or ten years."
Queen's granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four married. Beatrice is engaged!
The palace announced on Thursday that Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) had stopped for the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31) during the Italian holidays earlier this month.
“We’re so excited to announce our engagement, we’re both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in a statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will help us a lot in the years to come full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie snapped the pictures
The official engagement photos have been taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
However, the marriage of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really causes a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetics of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the genetic material of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking world, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros. Switzerland is involved in the high mountain hospital Davos, which is owned by the foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy eating are among the key influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors also determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known, it said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genera of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients at the University’s heart and vessel.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes have known possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - according to the clinic.
According to the initiators, the goal of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the investigation of other popular diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain cancer, heart disease and N are possible.
Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), chairman of the Kühne Foundation, also stressed that there was a strong will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos treats so far mainly allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine in Hamburg should be created and a professorship of bioinformatics was created at the heart of the company.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the clinic. In the genetic decoding, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of Zurich University to Mo, said Holchger.
According to the UKE, a person’s genetic material can now be deciphered within 24 hours. The pure material costs for this amount to 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to start on 1 October, all 9000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020. First results are expected in the year.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to indications from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian town of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of them still minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said to be raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and "improved". In fact, the pupils were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About one hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained up in a small room.
The Qur'an school has been in existence for about ten years, according to the information. Residents have been alerting the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. The parents were shocked when they were told about the conditions in the Qur'an school, said Sabo. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient government institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 40,000 people have fled the border into the neighboring state of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
Police officers at a school in northern Nigeria have rescued nearly 400 students from appalling conditions. "Many of them were chained up and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamic school. The conditions there were "unhumane" and the officials arrested the head of the school and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held in their school like slaves and chains, some being sexually abused. Television images showed thinned and injured students in a noticeably poor state of health.
World football election: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association honors the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year, for Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious reason.
Many things at FIFA have proved disgraceful in recent years: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. The FIFA World Footballer Election has not so far been suspected of uncleanly dismissing sympathy - according to nationalists - if one dismisses the nationalist objectivity.
But after Nicaragua’s captain complained that he had not voted at all, other inconsistencies emerge: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account, in fact they do not appear in the official and publicly available voting overview.
FIFA apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were made in capital letters and therefore not valid" and has contacted the Egyptian Federation several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan’s coach is also surprised.
While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote in the way it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in two and Sadio Mané in three. According to FIFA, however, the vote went as well as one with Stem.
Nicaragua’s captain Juan Barrera had also made accusations: “I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my vote is wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted on his behalf.
On Friday, the association sent the message: True, but of course it was not an intention. The completed electoral documents were "erroneously" provided with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it said in a communication of the association. But actually elected the second captain Manuel Rosas, "we took the responsibility for the error as well as Messan".
The other cases have been examined by FIFA in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process has been externally supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers, while Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the world football election - and Jürgen Klopp the world coach of the year.
Ukraine Affair: High-ranking Republicans Call for Official Investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have spoken out openly for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here is determined by the facts that can be determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower's case before impeachment action can be taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump has been observing Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair, with few showing discomfort about it. Scott’s remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, with the moderate governor of Virginia having already turned several times against Trump’s policies, such as the easing of environmental protection regulations and the tightening of embargo.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it."
Scott and Baker, as governors of U.S. states, formally have no voice in the proceedings against Trump, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. However, even the first Republican senators have expressed criticism about the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said that the case was inter-extres.
The case could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, and Democrats in the House have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political gain.
There is no exact timetable for the impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could seek so-called impeachment. However, the decision to actually impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such proceedings are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been enacted by an impeachment.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegitimately attacked the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austria's President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now, new heavy accusations against Rackete will be loud. For example, three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were arrested in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants told their tormentors in Italy, but "We can't exclude this from the pressA.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. They were Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities", it was repeatedly reported and subjected to physical violence.
NGOs and aid organizations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that after that, it will be done".
Italy’s right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini has demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy over aid to illegal immigration.
Musk Strives for Tesla Delivery Record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog “Electrek.”
Demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter said, and the challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went off the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered a good 95,000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers will be required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
U.S. budget dispute: Once again only bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the US on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing until November 21.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending caps for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again without spending plans ahead of the new fiscal year beginning on October 1. The Senate on Thursday followed the Trump House of Representatives and set a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until such a decision would have been decided by a partial Shutdown on Monday.
Shutdown averted
For the time being, the federal administration is now being funded at the level and in line with the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 that will end on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. For the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the new fiscal year’s spending framework of 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority. However, the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans more or less ready, which are hardly majority capable.
In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbed by the plans for the construction of the wall and their financing, which was actually planned for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall was already under construction in December 2018.
At the wall, the spirits separate
It is currently unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November will be. Even a shutdown is not ruled out.
Against the backdrop of the congress’ continued inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. Submission S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the funding of the federal administration at the previous year’s level, stop the travel activities of parliamentarians and hold back their plans until new wages are issued.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilisation will also be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a bill by the government that would allow all women to use in vitro fertilisation, which is likely to significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law defended by Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as an "opportunity" for society. It represents the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to its introduction, the cost of artificial insemination for all women is to be borne by the Social Security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still banned
By a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for an artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past in which women have in vain been charged with the release of the semen of a deceased child.
On the other hand, numerous members of the ruling La République en Marche (LREM) party of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken out for artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be inflicted with "double grief" if her children were still unhappy due to the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person in the future, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination is only allowed in France to heterosexual couples who cannot give birth to children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy will continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flight tax for Unis become louder
A lot is flown at the universities. That is why the country wants to have a climate tax paid there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they also come under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed before the summer break, is still not on the rise. After the State Rector's Conference had initially reacted sceptically to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities are still calling for a declaration on this matter.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the detainees were alleged to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At the time, there was a firefight between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman was later reported to have died of his serious injuries, but this time there were no injuries.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. According to the North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, the coast guard of Russia, according to its own information, is conducting patrols to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 octopus fish were discovered and seized on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority has not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there this year, according to media reports.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also lamented high ecological damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, small living creatures would also be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be dismantled in the sea, where they would be disposed of for 200 years.
In the future, only 18,000: US cuts asylum ceiling
The “most generous nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is scrambling for protection seekers: as the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis will receive asylum.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees once again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US State Department stated. In the now almost expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced reception readiness for protection seekers from around the world in recent years, with the previous administration of Barack Obama having much higher reception limits.
The target limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, but the State Department called the U.S. the "most merciful and generous nation in history," a phrase strongly reminiscent of the language used by the current U.S. president.
A “responsible approach” to refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild their homes, Trump said. He is receiving a lot of support from supporters for his hard course in migration policy, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to shut down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal relationship between the current measure and the current domestic developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a possibly threatening office.
According to the Foreign Office, the US government intends to focus on the reception of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus come into danger, according to the statement of the Foreign Office, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The U.S. wants people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries in particular. Against this background, the U.S. has only signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S.-Southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentine judiciary, an orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a reception center for monkeys in the United States. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostock zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so their release was mandatory. The animal was taken on Thursday night by direct flight to Dallas, but not as a passenger.
As the 53-kilogram human apex is unable to adapt to life in the wild, she is expected to live in the open enclosure of the Center for Great Apes in Florida in the future. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", formerly the pet of pop star Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, a "Sandra" must still be in the U.S.
"Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process for "Sandras" fundamental rights, initiated by animal rights activists, has helped to transform the Buenos Aires zoo into an eco-park. By 2023, a research and education facility will be created there to preserve the species.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new hussarean ride in the Italian Alps on the almost 3000 meter high Großer Tinne.
Without grid, double ground or other aids, the Swiss defeated the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent, thus subduing the old best mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike posted a significant increase in profits. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, the group announced on Tuesday. The reason for this is mainly the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas-Konkurrent directly to customers.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period through the end of August, with Nike’s strongest sales growth of 22 percent in China, benefitting Beaverton, Oregon, from its approach to direct consumer access via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Andy Campion, chief financial officer of Nike, announced that with strategic investments, Nike would continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer's "digital transformation" and thus expand its competitive advantage.
Lifelong stadium ban due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital imposed a life-long stadium ban on a fan in 2016. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "<0x40>officiallasroma, I'm going to say that you know what you're playing with. "<0x40>officiallasroma.
The club responded late Thursday. It had reported the fan's account on Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporter was never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify those responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the weekend.
However, there were also recent discussions about the fans of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of record champion Juventus Turin from entering the stadium. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
Fans have been linked to ongoing investigations into twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus, including heavy blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an accusation last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are said to be behind the black ticket trade, “military control” of the ticket trade for the fan curve and to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole years are dealt with catchy labels. If you take a closer look, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially kicked off the crab catch at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21, inaugurating the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent field to be rich all its surroundings".
The people of Gaochun have already started growing crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a defining industry, which provided for high incomes and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively involved in a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crabs.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimise administration and government services" and has diligently built the service network for "authorizations under one roof, a law enforcement team, a service network, a lending platform", which aims to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of the local level of development through the linkage to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui, the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a cultural landmark has been promoted to the fullest extent by the state of development, the state of development, the state of development, the state of development, and the state of development, the state of development, the state of development, and the state of development.
Iran-U.S. Conflict: Rouhani Speaks of Ending Sanctions - Trump Opposes
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, the United States in return for talks with the Tehran leadership has put an end to all sanctions, said Rouhani on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart via Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Rouhani. The kind of penalties that should be ended, we have clearly said, "And they all stood on the debate."
However, this advance was not carried out in an acceptable manner, criticized Rouhani. Given the current penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure" no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The Europeans had hoped to save the nuclear deal with Iran, which they had negotiated with Russia and China, to stop the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Rouhani would meet with Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes shook western Turkey within a short period of time, fears of a catastrophe are growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the million-dollar metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built residential houses collapse - among other things, a mortar made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which have been registered in the center as places of refuge, have long been built up.On the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük earthquake in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not safe from earthquakes.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at about seven kilometers of depth, according to the civil protection authority Afad. A small aftershock a few minutes later caused even greater panic on the streets.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. State broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were taken out of the buildings in Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying, as seen in pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plateau. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private individuals have packed so-called go-bags with everything they need next to doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to his reports, two minarets of mosques in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts fell.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic. Buildings rocked. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It had been more violent than Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings. The visible damage he suffered.
According to official data, the time of the quake is set at 13:59 (local time) and just minutes after the first quake, there was an aftershock, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale, according to CNN Turkey.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis of millions, the civil protection authority Afad announced already on Tuesday.
It wasn’t the only earthquake that made headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high, scientists believe it will eventually unload - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now, making it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Sooner or later the big earthquake will come as well."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also caused great concern in Istanbul. In addition, there had been a violent earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also at Lake Constance this year the earth had thronged.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two bursting documents are providing new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, the U.S. Democrats are strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president.
USA: United Airlines passenger imprisoned in toilet - flyer rerouted
According to U.S. media, a flight by United Airlines was rerouted because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco.
In an unplanned stopover in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was finally freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour had she been locked in it, US media wrote, citing other passengers. To continue flying towards San Francisco, passengers had to change the aircraft.
In a video published on the Internet, which is said to have been taken from Flight 1554, according to US media, it is seen how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. At first, it was open whether the woman received compensation.
The cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous narration “The Transformation”, British bestselling author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" (original: "The Cockroach") will be published in German on November 27th, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain. He does not see it as his mission, the will of the people.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie as the Soviet leaders once did, if Brexiteers in high positions are begging for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do."
Kafka's story, first published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an enormous beetle", is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands on his head," Diogenes publisher said.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are given whisper brakes to reduce the noise pollution caused by freight trains, and sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are being modernized and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this is to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure pot "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has canceled all trips up to and including October 31, 2019, one day after his insolvency application.
This also affects bookings made by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid for or fully paid for. As for travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into bankruptcy by the British parent company and had filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, among others, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to send money back to hotels
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, which currently host Thomas Cook vacationers, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are subject to the condition that vacationers are no longer asked to extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels are not required to pay hotel bills individually or otherwise," said Sprecher Bernd.
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the spot. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers (Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen) had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be agreed with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holiday packages were still on the way from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return travel of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are currently on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on holiday, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips up to and including October 31st would be cancelled. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As for trips starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out about the possibilities of refunding the travel price on the Kaera website and assert their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
In Africa, Prince Harry has been following in the footsteps of his mother for a long time.
In Angola, British Prince Harry has detonated and destroyed a mine in a blue splinter vest.
Near a British Halo Trust camp near the town of Dirico, he set up the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 populations in the field than in the African country.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to travel the path she went then. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. Also she had demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stopping Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him there will be a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations guaranteed. But what statements are already of eternal duration in the polarizing British. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the United Kingdom floats like a Damocles sword over the blonde head. His suspension of the Parliament, to be able to carry out his Brexit course until the beginning of the week, Johnson was obliged to hold a debate.
Boris Johnson thinks the deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass noticeably on Johnson, meanwhile, while visiting a hospital, he made indications that in the event of a non-agreement, he supports an extension of the negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that it will work.
And time is running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels gradually. About six weeks still the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent a UK exit from the European Union without a deal. But even the recent talks have not achieved a breakthrough again. A Brexit deal currently seems rather difficult to imagine. If the British prime minister does not break the law, but a re-deployment of the prime minister is in force.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Agency CDC reported. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there have already been more than 900 affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of L'injuries is still known to be similar. The cause of L'injuries is still not known.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The contractor and actor living in Spain calls for a "people's revolution". For this Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, to which critics accuse corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes mass demonstrations of the country's one million participants.
The security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo, there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations were closed, streets around central Tahrir Square were closed. In recent days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partly searched the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there had been protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. Such an open protest had not occurred in Egypt in years. Accordingly, security forces reacted harshly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were wrongly arrested at the place where they were being held "involuntarily" for a while.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, according to which the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Morsi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been jailed and partially convicted in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fox of Greenland Expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed upon his arrival in the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg had brought over the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar scientist. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. For decades, people had known that the earth was warming. Yet many were acting as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under the exclusion of the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the littering of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, a drone was used to measure Greenland glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastics, it said.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar scientist from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said skipper Boris Herrmann to the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the castle of Angels in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. Although the bill with 80 euros tip was paid by the two women, they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the reputation of Rome, and we are asking the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," a spokesman for Federagit, the association of guides in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday issue).
The owners of the restaurant responded promptly. The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this cannot be seen from the bill. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, said the host.
U.S. President Donald Trump may indeed face impeachment proceedings following the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to examine this as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the talk of weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposed to be the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has finally made the conversation public out of concern for national security and democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the president has been using the power of his office against Ukraine, he has actively forced the government of another country to influence it.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not give the full text, but the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, at the center of which, next to Trump, is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story is starting from the point of view of the public of Ukraine in May 2019, when the New York Times is reporting to me of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet illegally in Kiev with the newly elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We can't get involved in an election, we can't get involved in an investigation", but it is very helpful to me.
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump’s anti-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct an occasion for the Russia investigation in the United States, but this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will talk about on the phone with Selenskyj so prominently in July. The version of Giuliani and the president says: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidacy of the democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's official of the Obama administration, has been responsible for the dismissal of his bi-state of the then-general.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general go, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Moreover, Schokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt behavior, the US government was by far not even the only Western partner to support the Obama administration on his dismissal.
Disturbances on Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social Media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. According to this, mainly Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not loaded since about 3.30 pm. Also Instagram gives the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems affected by the disruption, although so far not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disruptions
It’s not the first massive crash of this year. As early as March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in the previous cases, this time users mainly resort to Twitter to make their anger air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were traveling in an inflatable boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the misfortune - less than an hour it took the Chilean rescue helicopter to recover.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 am we received the message, at just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were above the inflatable".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there.
Attention: Smartphone NEVER charge wirelessly
Practical but damaging
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Recently, several new smartphones have launched, which support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. Wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery again heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers have the wattage, even if the smartphone is perfectly aligned, the level of the battery on the phone increases a little more than 30 degrees.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Since every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only absorbs capacity, but also does not last for as long overall. The lifespan is shorter, so the researchers advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery replacement on modern smartphones has always increased a T for high costs.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply place the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug fumelei. Since with Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer) a worldwide standard is enforced, in which exceptionally, the technology should hardly be used.
Everest Dam Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) having reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo in the spring of climbers queuing on Mount Everest.
The image of the mass riot triggered a debate over stronger security measures on the 8,848-metre-high mountain and highest peak on earth. In May, eleven climbers died during the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th millennium: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather, among other things. Earlier this week Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepalese government wanted to talk to China to allow him to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four carcasses were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers on whose land the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants a year. This is usually done when the animals move through villages built close to their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left, with the death penalty theoretically imposed on them.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its landing by Iran. This was announced by the maritime office Bandar Abbas according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had fixed the tanker flying under the British flag on July 19 under the accusation of having violated the rules of maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the criticism
The responsible economic committee of the House of Commons wants to thoroughly investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. The aim is to deal with the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British government did not want to financially join the company struggling for survival. "Our interest is to supervise the company as well as the control by external auditors," said the board's chairman, Rachel Revees.
According to experts, genes are overestimated in colorectal cancer risk
The role of genes in the family-related increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors, such as family dietary habits, are therefore likely to be more difficult than previously assumed. This had consequences for calculations of individual colon cancer risk, emphasize the DKFZ.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it said in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to get the cars to the customers quickly, with Tesla having to make as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went off the market with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased so strongly in almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records to reach his high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers will be required in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have been losses last year.
Does the British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson reluctantly
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he is looking for ways to circumvent Parliament’s latest law against an unregulated Brexit, saying in front of journalists on Friday that his government will abide by current law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law and use a procedural trick that would delay the law's entry into force until after it leaves the EU.
Johnson said he is aiming for a treaty with the European Union, “We are confident that we will leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is to reach an agreement.”
Iran Expects to Increase Uranium Enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased the pressure on European contracting parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, European states show incapacity or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rouhani said Thursday at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand to their promises, he put forward the agreement's "extended steps" away from the agreement in 2015.
The backdrop is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The United States last stepped out of the agreement alone in 2018, in order to react with "maximum pressure" to a change of course in the policy considered aggressive against Iran. The government of President Donald Trump wants to restrain a new agreement with Iran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium, and that Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 more centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to bear their share of the deal, leaving the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of oppressive US sanctions, Rouhani speculated, but there will still be more talks that hopefully will bring a solution.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the situation has changed after an attack on a major oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Monday followed the US assessment that Tehran bears responsibility for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had acknowledged the attack, which was not confirmed by the US as a false confession on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations have to present evidence for it," Rouhani said, but European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out a British attack like this. Rouhani had met in recent days with Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of France's Prime Minister.
Rouhani urged the administration in Washington to turn to a policy of “dialogue and reason” before talks could be held with President Trump.
Comet from another star crosses solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, and this has been done for the first time. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn about other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its explorer to 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet had been discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter.Repeat observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not originate from our solar system.
2I/Borisov, after 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, is only the second interstellar object seen during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get close-up insights into a foreign solar system before it vanishes on Never-repeat communication. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is clearly at a distance of about 150,000 kilometers per hour, or so.
According to analyses, the comet is traveling on a so-called hyperbel orbit that takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star was first discovered, which was initially the name of the interstellar star of the catalog number C/2019 Q.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted approaching, so the researchers have many months left for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and will then be visible until April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "Then it will be observed until October 2020 only with larger, professional telescopes".
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. According to a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in an initial investigation the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Pictures of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles those of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition may be similar to that of other comets in our solar system," said Lea, a researcher at IAC.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such trips are. One of the next interstellar visitors could potentially intercept a planned satellite mission by the European Space Agency (ESA).
The agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028, which, according to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, will either lurk at an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system, or at an interstellar visitor such as 1I.
First landing at Beijing's new mega-airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital has landed a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, some 45 million passengers will be handled at the new airport annually, and by 2025, it will be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “sea stars” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had announced several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 - and much smaller - has so far been repeatedly postponed. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four-and-a-half hours - this is what the UK space agency is dreaming of, the UK space agency. The aim is to make possible this, for the 2030s flight targeted at supersonic speed, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Send Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US broadcaster CNN said very much, the agency said.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency intends to work closely with the Australian airliner. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis has announced such a program currently lasts about 20 hours. As the only so far supersonic aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the route New York-Paris in 2003 and took three to three-and-a-half hours to develop it. In the year 2000, the U.S.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that is five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft could also be used outside the Earth's atmosphere, thus enabling the "next generation of devices to be re-employable".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told U.S. officials at the U.N. in New York on Thursday, adding that the person concerned was almost "a spy" and that they had been "a little bit different" in the past than they are today.
This was regarded as an attempt at intimidation against tippers. The event was not actually public. Several US media outlets, however, broadcast audio footage of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outraged to the statement of the president.
On Tuesday, Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their accusations are mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who has raised serious allegations against Trump and his government headquarters. The whistleblower’s statements were made under heavy public pressure.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. president “uses the power of his office” to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in late July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden, dealing with former deals of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect the president’s de-Just in the race.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of cover-up regarding the Ukraine phone call: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been stored. This was removed after the conversation was instructed by lawyers from the White House, but was specially provided for in an ordinary conversation.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that would have turned out to be inaccurate, so there may not be any tippers or spies at all.
Trump’s comments in New York about the whistleblower’s alleged information sparked outrage, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded with concern and lamented that Trump’s statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway in various committees against Trump and his environment for months, and in the face of the accusations of Ukraine, Democrats are now pursuing investigations with new force to initiate a possible impeachment proceedings against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said House Intelligence Committee chief Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and again called for the committee chairman's resignation. Trump regularly insulted ship and had already called for his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, most of whom served under Democratic but also Republican presidents, stood behind a possible impeachment probe launched by Democrats in a statement on Friday, saying that if the allegations were true, it would be “a ruthless power” by Trump.
There is no exact timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could pursue a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no U.S. president has been elected.
VW-Betriebsrat: Jobs are "sneaking down"
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce production costs could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the company’s works council around. The brand aims to reduce its annual factory costs by €10 billion by 2023. Of this, €500 million is already to be saved this year.
The key to this is personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the Works Council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, a job security will apply until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from works council circles, however, jobs in production, which were not actually at the disposal, are "sneaking" down by another way - that is, past the official course.
In these cases, the Works Council has no way of forcing re-occupation. In many places, there is now a lack of staff, labour constraints are increasing, worries about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicleworks would become greater. This also increases the fear that vehicle production could gradually be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world.
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more worldwide and centrally control new projects. This also reduces costs and also accelerates decisions - behind this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Especially in uncertain times from Brexit to the looming trade war, we are well at war between the USA and China".
For example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be shortened by 1.1 hours.
Twenty hours.
In our region, the main plant in Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars must be built there every year in order for the plant to be satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was at only around 700,000 vehicles and the consumption was due to the problems caused by the diesel production.
As production board member Tostmann already announced last year, one million cars will roll off the production line in Wolfsburg "perspectively", which will make possible the bundling of the golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is handing over the golf production through the conversion to the site for the electric car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Golf 8. It is supposed to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers for the time being despite all efforts to build e-mobility.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human traffickers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, sent to the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, with six suspected human traffickers being jailed.
Six suspected Nigerian traffickers were sentenced on Friday in Bochum to parole and imprisonment for up to eight years and three months. The defendants had sent young Nigerian women to the Ruhr and forced them into prostitution. To force their obedience, the Nigerian women who were willing to leave had to leave their homeland before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought across the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in inflatable boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. Arriving in Germany, they were distributed among various brothels to deal with the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros. The wage was therefore completely deducted from them.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the introduction and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. "The work made it difficult for the women physically and mentally," said judge Isabel Hoffmann at the verdict. "Some were really disgusted."
The verdicts are based on commercial and gang-based immigration of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has once again threatened strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "on October 14th inform about the measures of the labour struggle in the LH Group", said UFO-Tarif-Chef Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have refused for months to conduct collective bargaining with the UFO. It is also about the question of whether the union has legally signed collective agreements with the Lufthansa.
In this regard, Ufo now sees itself strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labor Court. Lufthansa wanted to have it determined that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is examining appeals against it. "I think it is unlikely that a second court will see the matter completely differently," said Ufo CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa filed an application with the state labour court in Frankfurt to have the UFO’s status as a trade union verified in court, arguing that the union had not set up a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a collective bargaining partner.
A fierce leadership dispute had preceded the divisional union, in the course of which numerous members of the executive board and the advisory board, including the longtime union leader Nicoley Baublies, had resigned. The UFO had suspended an initial vote on strikes by cabin personnel at Eurowings at the end of July due to doubts about its leadership.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia wasn’t exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that’s about to change now. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract international tourists in the future.By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors will be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission announced.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the tourism commission.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access for tourists. Visas are usually only given for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the archconservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
By mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production fell sharply, the oil price shots reached high. It is expected that it will take several weeks for the kingdom’s oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelorette party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful suits, including banana-printed suits, on Instagram and asked his followers, “Help me choose my smoking for the wedding.” According to media reports, the celebrity couple is planning to marry church next weekend.
A year ago, the Biebers gave themselves the yes word in a New York State registry office. There was no bigger party at that time.
In an interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two found a common level: “If you don’t want to compromise, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the town of Mecin (Mechin), the police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the aircraft since Thursday evening after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. The search also involved a military helicopter. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable logging and the growth of cities are also causes of the threat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 known tree species in Europe. 265 of them occur on no other continent. Of these 265 are threatened 58 percent. 66 are already at the highest level of risk of endangerment.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "endangered by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Caucasian and wild horse chestnut threatened
One of the authors, David Allen, told the German Press Agency: “Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats.”
It also looks bad for the wild Ordinary Horse Chestnuts. They are considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat represents the Balkan Mining Moth alongside a mushroom. It has spread from Southeast Europe to the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horse chestnuts in Europe as less than 10,000.
Shrub species and mosses also at risk
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one-fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, entrained species, agricultural practices and climate change. Molluscs are a key food source for birds.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office.
Earthquake ahead of Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the latest earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. There were no deaths, according to the reports. Dozens of people have had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, and since the quake the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and triggered panic in the million-dollar metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced, in the last 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called Northern Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 quake shook the region around Istanbul, calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the halftime show of the next American football final Super Bowl, the singers announced on Twitter. "It will not be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She is insanely excited to be on the Super Bowl stage in 2020.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of playing at the Super Bowl since 1996, when she saw Diana Ross fly to the skies at the halftime show. “Now it’s even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I’m going to perform with another Latina,” she said.
Shakira said in a statement that she felt honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the largest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "queens" were on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia, Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectators
The Super Bowl is the culmination of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you’ve recently seen a drop in viewership, the spectacle in the U.S. attracted the fewest viewers in more than a decade this February. Still, there were almost a hundred million people on average.
There had been turmoil ahead of the last Super Bowl halftime show: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the reviews were unfriendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, did not go on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem for protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump has not been attacked since 2017.
Cook Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There is a threat of high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse are likely to have to write down up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion in their books, according to the report, according to estimates by consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciation of 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds, the amounts actually depreciated are likely to be at the top of the ranges, an expert told the paper.
The extent of the creditors’ losses in the end will be apparent at the end of the insolvency proceedings. One person close to this procedure did not show too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor locations. The most money you can probably get out of the sale of the airport slots and the Thomas Cook brand, it said.
Rackete reportedly brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. “We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any secured information,” said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, ramming a ship of the Italian financial police. The three suspects are also said to have arrived there on the day. The captain is under investigation for aiding illegal immigration.
U.S. warns federal government of Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great," Pai told the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from security agencies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests," the FCC chief said, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the federal government has agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin initially wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt", citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
It’s the software that’s important to keep your devices up to date, and it’s made up of billions of lines of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
It is “very hard to imagine” that a government agency, “no matter where, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks,” the FCC chief said.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The company, which is allegedly owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the "Handelsblatt".
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to promote the U.S. position, but the U.S. has found that government officials have been placed inside the company.
Chemistry factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic wall of fire illuminates the sky over a North French chemical factory. The fire is extinguished after hours - but the clean-up work could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and crèches in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the competent prefecture said. The Ministry of the Interior had asked citizens to stay in buildings as much as possible and not expose themselves to the smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were asked to bring their animals inside, protect their food and stop the harvest for the time being.
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, according to the prefecture. There was still a risk of odor spreading after the extinguishing, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 police and gendarmes were in use at the place of the fire.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the Lubrizol company, which produces additives for oils. The production facility is a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news broadcaster BFMTV that at first no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples, but pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river dams were built against the pollution, the prefecture explained.
Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine River between Paris and the port city of Le Havre, and the city of Le Havre is the capital of the French capital.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister of Economy and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better," Le Maire said at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens to make the necessary decisions.”
Action should be taken by those countries that have budgetary room for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these freedoms, the minister added, pointing to the high national debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French national debt must be "stabilized" and "lowered", Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment to revive the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly urged France to address its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding, among other things, to the protests of the yellow vest movement, which is expected to reduce the new debt to 2.2 percent, according to an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson avoids question on Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the “capitulation law” passed by parliament.
Parliament is back, a law mandates the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. However, critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. Addressed to this possibility, the Tory politician, however, turns away.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covering up whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the latest law passed by parliament, which is exactly what should prevent it.
The law stipulates that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday speculated that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The prime minister could use a procedural trick that postpones the law's entry into force until the time after the EU leaves. Johnson said he is aiming for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the way is to leave the EU with the best agreement on 31 October".
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, stated that he sees the political clashes over Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the desired EU exit will still come to fruition: “We are enjoying that, we will win, we will leave the UK (reference to a book before the EU),” said Cumming, “don’t worry.”
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the campaign ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist at the British government's Downing Street headquarters, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into an almost hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pouches) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented The Polaroid Diaries at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September, with illustrious guests including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting glimpse into the lives of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have been made, a few hundred of them are now being published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course there is always one in the center: her husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
There he dances on his shoulders with his daughter Mary, phones in a bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they were beyond the headlights on their farm in southern England or Scotland also led a completely normal life. So Mary McCartney had always said at a bedtime, according to a BBC, that she wasn't sleeping out of old.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's all about the decision: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment," Paul McCartney said. "If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing exactly the right moment. "She just knew she had it," Paul said in the Esh-un.
There is the light, the composition, the pictorial detail and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes seem like abstract paintings. The perfect complement to the recently re-released Beatles.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran, and that the country has been unable to stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey has problems with importing Iranian oil, as some companies have withdrawn “because of US threats”.
“Turkey will continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues,” said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iran’s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict the reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual limit of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees.
The foreign ministry said that while the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
The US government intends to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are in danger, according to the statement of the Foreign Ministry, while Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to receive a maximum of 1,500 refugees.
The program, launched in 1980, selects refugees from UN camps around the world and resettles them in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House just under 5,000.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said David Miliband, the head of the International Rescue Committee, which would further damage its leadership in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States – both legal and illegal. The US government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: "Come close to a sniper"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever gave the whistleblower, who accuses him of abuse of power, appropriate clues, "comes close to a sniper," Trump said, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
According to Trump, he spoke to U.N. mission officials. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial White House incidents, he replied, “This is close to a sneaker.” Then Trump added, “You know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayals, we used to do a little bit differently.”
Observers rated the latter as a possible allusion to the death penalty. The Democrats were sharply critical of Trump’s statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairmen of the House of Representatives wrote in a statement.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-published complaint of having abused his office in order to solicit interference from another country in the U.S. election in 2020. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Hunt in the summer.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower is and who the whistleblower is, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is supposed to be a CIA intelligence analyst.
Refugee boat crashed: baby and toddlers drown in Aegean Sea
Time and again people are trying to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats regularly dock. In the sinking of an inflatable boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
Outside the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of an inflatable boat, including a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard said. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had left Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small archipelago of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is not known from which countries the migrants come from. Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who canceled the concert
A U.S. concert by the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to an inaccuracy of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. On the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it while it's still running."
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey "can't really talk right now". Townsend promised the audience that he would be able to pay for a reparation concert.
The Who announced that they will be picked up at a later date for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting Suddenly Stopped: WeWork Makes Real Estate Markets Tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force in the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Landlords have to fear for billions of dollars in revenue.
The crisis of the office landlord WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had dropped founder Adam Neumann as boss a few days ago, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and securities such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the company has reported the largest of the London's offices, among other things.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and leases it in the short term in part small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company reported a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion, and new expenses are now estimated to be incurred by new companies.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, has rented almost 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the one in New York, where the office would be the best in the world.
Even in the British capital, the balance in the real estate market could be noticeably delayed without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in an office house in the center of the financial metropolis, bought last year by the savings fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a portion of the expected billions of revenues. They do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual locations of WeWork is founded in special limits only by the subsidiary of PurWork.
Russia arrested many North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 poachers arrested in recent days who illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it was said. The communist North Korea suffers from chronic lack of food.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian territorial waters. There, the Coast Guard of Russia is carrying out patrols according to its own information to protect their marine biological resources. During the re-checks, a total of 30,000 squid fish were discovered. In addition, according to the information, according to three fishing boats and two motor boats, 8,000 were seized and, after Nachodka and Posjet, the Russian Coast Guard was brought to Vladivostok in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority did not issue fishing licences to the North Koreans, even after complaints from local traders this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there according to media reports in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained about high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. With these, also small living beings would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would not be dismantled in the sea, and the nets would be dismantled in the sea, where they were 200 years.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week, and a North Korean, who was also wounded, died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second, after it opened fire.
U.S. Bans Ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed a travel ban on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children. The U.S. State Department said in a statement on Thursday that Castro was involved in "gross human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As the chairman of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was also responsible for human rights violations there through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime, are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba," Mike tweeted.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump banned entry, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, there has been a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him to his knees and bring opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors deployed. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
Fridays for Future Climate Protests
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, today thousands of people want to take to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world. The beginning is likely to be due to the shift in time in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests over Europe move to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major rally in Montreal, Canada. Also in front of the White House in Washington.
It is relatively unclear how high the global response will be this Friday after last week’s record turnout. Thunberg himself was a good thing. “Last Friday, over four million people were on strike for the climate. This Friday, we are doing it again!” she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries as part of the strike week, she added.
A good third of all protesters worldwide - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller towns and cities in the north of Germany.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat down before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on politicians in his country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. As a result, the Fridays for Future movement emerged within a short period of time. Students and students are mainly involved in the climate protests, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from policymakers in the fight against global warming and the imminent climate catastrophe. Above all, according to the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming must be curbed to below 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial period.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic cruise with a deep-sea racing yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday she gave an emotional speech at the United Nations, in which she spoke strongly to the world’s heads of state and government on the issue of the Nobel Prize. In her home country, the Right for Climate Protection was held on Wednesday.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow told the agency Tass on Thursday. The ban is expected to enter into force on October 1.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, must expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should ignite a fire, then the penalty is higher. According to the prohibition, burning candles also fall under the Ministry. Also to grill meat skewers on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Attack on cybercriminals - Investigators take out servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time extracted a large server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected, as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, to have hosted numerous websites through which internationally acting criminals operated their machinations.
This was announced by the Prosecutor General's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday evening. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second-largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had smashed in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
Such a hoster has been extracted for the first time in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 had been searched in Germany and the neighboring foreign country. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon the investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, today thousands of people want to take to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia and Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s backmen?
A sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl is keeping the mirror in front of the people of power of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt himself chosen to get the boat up for a better climate-friendly world, as well as to win the sea with a more just people.
But is there a dark side to this? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has sold itself widely, thanks to her daughter in the spotlight. Also, the old-tested followers of Greta Thunberg were very good in the world.
Here the spirits are now dividing: Is it morally correct to enrich oneself financially in saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock exchange brokers during the global rescue campaign? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is always more important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy can also make sense of certain ideas and discussions.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have been confirmed: A foreign comet is currently traversing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Researchers have long suspected it, but now they are certain that a comet from another star is currently traversing our solar system. It was named 2I/Borisov after its explorer and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen while flying through.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch a glimpse of a foreign solar system from close up. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly of interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelway that takes it out of our system.
Comet was spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is done, astronomers will be able to observe it closely. Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted professionally in its approach, which means that it can be investigated from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then until April 2020, with medium-sized telescopes, it will only be seen by 2020", explains Davide Farnocchia of the Na-Raa.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings on comet 2I/Borisov spark hope in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León put it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems through similar processes as in ours, added de Leóns Kollege.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid rushed past Earth and came dangerously close to it.
'Absolutely reprehensible': Rachel Johnson shocked by brother
Boris Johnson is becoming lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister scourges with clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "flavorless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is equipping - at least verbally. During the House question hour on Wednesday, this met with massive outrage from the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have spoken out: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words such as surrender, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, stretched, divided, tarted and feathered". She considers this to be exceedingly reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, Rachel Johnsons, who was in the EU's anti-parliament elections.
In particular, she was struck by the fact that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly member of the House of Commons, was very disliked, who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. The memory of which can best be honored by going through Brexit, had said Boris Johnson in the House of Commons. "It is very disgusting to have been dismissed by a member of the House.
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos's name is used that way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is by passionately and resolutely stepping in for what you believe - no matter what opinion you are. But you should never have "demonized the other side."
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother, Jo, had resigned as secretary of state and his mandate as a Tory MP. “I’ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest over the past few months — it’s an indissoluble tension,” Johnson said.
Johnson's language was also met with sharp criticism in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they declared: "In recent days, the language, both in debates and outside of parliament, should not have been acceptable to each other."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
The NFL is setting a strong sign in the year of its 100th anniversary: in the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots will perform, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl Latina Power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the halftime show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL, as announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
Shakira ("Waka Waka") is from Colombia, and Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin. The American football league will celebrate its 100th birthday on February 2nd in Miami, Florida.
"I love that this time the Super Bowl will put two women on the stage - and two Latinas," Lopez said. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed great hits with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in German cinemas from November onwards in the drama "Hustlers".
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected every time in the United States. This year, many also value the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least due to the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused furore there. As a rule, the NFL Finals are watching well over 100 million TV viewers, it is also very popular in Germany now.
There were political controversies in the run-up to last year. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up when playing the national anthem, out of protest against police violence against blacks, and for this, among other things, had been harshly attacked by US President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had kicked off the band.
An actor and YouTuber admits to Egypt's ruler: For now, however, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men, who have an influence on whether Egypt's streets are flowing blood again, have not been sent to see the people of Egypt, the president said they had spent the last week in a foreign country. One of the two, who was floating again at the airport in Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general, who in 2013 had spent the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected president of the country, said that he had spent hundreds of New York.
Misleading - in the opinion of the president, this is the other man who is currently determining what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he escaped the access of the security forces, who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old as an actor was only telling a minority of the country's Sisum, who is now known to the political secret.
He addresses the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are starving, the president indulges in luxury and lets himself build magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule, accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he speaks in his second profession as a construction contractor, just for 15 years, the president is showing the pressure of exactly these gentlemen, he seems to know quite well.
After last week, for the first time since Sisi's grip on power, thousands of demonstrators had protested against his rule, and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested at first, Alisi called for a "millions march" on Friday. That really so many people were going to the streets, the protest was unlikely to show himself at the scene of the protests. But the protest came to a little in the case.
From the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where demonstrators last week stopped holding banners with the president's portrait, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces erected checkpoints in the city and on the run-off roads. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city were killed because of "maintenance work" to be taken to the ground.
Mohamed Ali said: “Our goal does not have to be Tahrir Square. Let’s not clash with police officers. But as a retreat, it is not to be understood: “All of Egypt is Tahrir Square.”
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to blindly trust the speed information of the providers. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved in case of anomalies.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Central.
If the connection always appears to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options, such as measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measuring the actual data transmission rates and comparing them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the providers are carried out according to provider-specific specifications and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," the Bavarian Consumer Authority said in a statement.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service.
If this has no effect even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and possibly also demand damages. However, if no success is achieved, only the means of action can help.
First high-ranking Republican to investigate
As the first high-ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads from here will be determined by the facts that will be taken," Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower's impeachment case before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been observing Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far withheld criticism of Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have revealed discomfort about it. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policy several times, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man Remains in the MCU: Another Marvel Movie Planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go their separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This is reported by several U.S. media. According to this, the film is already scheduled to start in the United States from July 16, 2021.
In Screenrant, Marvel Boos Kevin Feige is quoted as saying, “I’m thrilled that Spidey’s path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are thrilled that we can continue to work on it... He’s the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey verse.”
But what about the sudden good news? Allegedly Sony Marvel made an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney group, which also includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenue of coming Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the grand finale in the USA. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated for many years in the series, was paid a charming tribute finale. Attention, the following section contains Spoiler.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed once again the most memorable scenes with the Duchess of today. For example, the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his suspended prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned casually in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight to the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a telling remark.
Aegean Sea: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned while a refugee boat was being hijacked in the Aegean Sea. A total of seven people died in the disaster, the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation", Seehofer said on Friday, then in Athens he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to be able to help with the coping.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission on Friday confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Home Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece is still home to an unusually large number of migrants from Turkey, with 654 people transferring to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Citizens’ Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The increased numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally coming to the Greek islands via Turkey. In return, the EU wanted to accept a Syrian refugee from Turkey for every deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is difficult on the Greek side because of staff shortages. According to the Ministry of Citizens’ Protection, almost 29,400 people are suffering from Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos. The worst situation is on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
There have never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate Change: Heat Leads to More Heart Attacks
According to doctors, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate change is "totally certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Above all, the cardiovascular system caused high temperatures and large temperature jumps to create heart disease in a short period of time and causes people to suffer from diabetes.
Green politician must be held accountable for embarrassing photo breach
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was for this reason the cup manipulated?
The Canadian Greens boss holds a reusable mug in her hand in a photo, but now it came out: the mug was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has gone unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee mug with metal straw never held Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, in her hand. On the party's website, she was reported on a photo with this mug, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published, the postal service had been published, and there was also the media -
Greens chief must be held accountable for photo breach
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news in order to appear more credible on the subject of "environmental protection", and this in the midst of a campaign for the lower house election, in which it is also increasingly difficult for Trudeau because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked the discussion about fake news. One user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their chairmen to hide their disposable mug."
May was shocked and stated on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, held a cup in her hand. However, if she put it correctly, it was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was only about seeing something on the website.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she tells the Guardian, asking herself something of her over-dedicated team: "If they want to work on a picture again, can't they do something with my face so that I look younger?"
The German Greens, too, have fallen into Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on holiday, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer Wants Free Upgrade: Lifelong Flight Ban on Cathay
Allegedly, Jaqueline Ng had been assured of an upgrade by Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she was never allowed to fly again with Cathay.
Getting a spontaneous upgrade for Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free change from Economy Class.
This case, however, shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, more than 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the outbound flight, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although she showed an email in which her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter allegedly received the influencer from a marketing employee of the airline, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the email.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time, the woman is said to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK airport were sceptical: they hooked up at the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail allegedly originated, did not deny the mail contact with Jaqueline. The message was also denied by the mail system.
Airline staff at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a life-long ban on Cathay Pacific, who had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan for $1,400 (around $1,280).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because while Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the email, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now enlists a lawyer.
Oil prices rise after Yemen ceasefire report
Oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time possible on Friday afternoon, with a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent costing $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
A Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen said Saudi Arabia had agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had halted five percent of global oil production in mid-September. The Houthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen, allied with Iran, had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, blames Iran. A ceasefire would cause political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually come to fruition, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the commodity strategy department at Saxo Bank of Bloomberg news agency.
A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to nearly $59, Brent nearly $65.
Last month, Bloomberg reported that repairs to oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were progressing faster than expected after the mid-September attack, with production again reaching eight million barrels per day and moving back toward the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting of rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but commodity experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a public offering and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the landing by Iran and the recently granted approval on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship lies further in front of anchor, Chief of Shipping Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>gen H<0xC3><0xA5>nell told the radio.
The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had in recent weeks significantly increased oil prices.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair of potential abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several senior government officials have reportedly worked intensively after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July to prevent access to the wording of the conversation.
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that the nuclear dispute will soon see a third summit between Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump, and the point and prospects of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in implementing the agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to the KCNA agency.
The U.S. has done nothing to implement last year's summit resolutions, the North's foreign ministry adviser said, criticizing heightened U.S. sanctions and joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers, but hoping for a "wise" and "courageous" decision by Trump to bring it closer together.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he agreed. Negotiations on a disarmament of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program have come to a halt since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, the two met successfully again in the demilitarized zone.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers to help mine clearance
Wearing a blue splinter vest, British Prince Harry symbolically set off and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the village of Dirico, he helped to establish the ignition circle. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free of mines by 2025, he did not ask for help from all the countries, "I have to go to the running of the TV-cameras".
Pounds under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an early interest rate cut, the pound loses value against the euro.
Frankfurt’s speculation on an early interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) is growing to the pound sterling, with the British currency down by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
Keynote banker Michael Saunders said that he was talking about a rate cut, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising, as Saunders was a proponent of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Rica.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the strain on the economy caused by the Brexit hickack, without directly signaling an interest rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU if necessary without a divorce agreement on October 31.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the athletics World Cup, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are unveiled - and they destroy the few credibility that Russian sport had gained back at the beginning of the year and even only in a nutshell. In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from the years 2012 to 2015.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sport had been revealed. At that time, the Wada had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Russada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee left after individual examination at the Summer Games in Rio in 2016, and in the 2016 Summer Games, some 270 athletes of the country took part in the Winter Games.
Positive findings are missing
In the following September, Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but demanded access to the laboratory and the samples. The data were intended to provide information on the extent of the cover-up of cases of doping in state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data was manipulated from the Moscow analytical laboratory. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data," said David Howman, who received the positive data in an interview with the "Whistler General Newspaper."
The World Cup not affected
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the Athletics Association is the only organization to hold on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, Wada had already put manipulations in the room and urged Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-blocking of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
