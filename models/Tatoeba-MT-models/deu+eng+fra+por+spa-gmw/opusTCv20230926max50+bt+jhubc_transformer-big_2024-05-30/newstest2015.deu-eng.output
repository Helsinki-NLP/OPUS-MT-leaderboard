The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is meeting with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty on defense cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Old Man After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a petrol station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and drove further down Burgess Road before bogging into the bushland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle, as well as a person who corresponded to the description of the driver, were later seen at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of non-observance of a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the Karratha District Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, read the indictment at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment says Webster attacked her while she was “unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date for the November 17 trial at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
“Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate on the basis of the organization of trade unions as on other forms of discrimination – stopping anti-unionist forces.
Supplementing the national labour law to provide a way for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a union representation, to sue in a civil court for justice – and to obtain damages or penalties – is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks unions have faced in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to unite in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions played a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that “workers’ rights to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that limit or aim to diminish this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other writers made a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As this country discussed with other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a trade union – and then that this trade union should participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge Temporarily Stops Law That All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana Could Force Closure
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was enacted by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and is due to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to have a right to receive patients at a hospital within a 30-mile radius to acquire their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to perform abortions legally for the time being, while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they are working to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing is scheduled for the judge to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying that doctors are thus giving more time to gain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means that Louisiana women are avoiding a deceptive law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to doctors from the two clinics who did not join the lawsuit and had also applied for induction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi recently declaring such measures unconstitutionally.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state’s remaining clinics to close were halted by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that instructional rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents oppose the fact that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.
Only one doctor performing abortions in Louisiana has patient information rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery out of fear for his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their requests for patient detention rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute online for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions, and social and economic status also influenced survival chances.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distances, as a possible remedy, she proposed strengthening the service of inflight doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide more dense care to women in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographic status, revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer, underscoring the need for better treatment and preventive strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret declining homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “Garden Products Core Group,” according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people with homeowners spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of paving pre-gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, where an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion is put into sale annually.
In Greater London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that rented housing or small gardens do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said: “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state-run television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3,000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometre away they supplied clashes equipped with sticks and stones with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters called for Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
Meanwhile, the country’s army is calling for a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without using violence.”
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been plastered more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in last May’s parliamentary election.
Protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey’s foreign ministry has ordered the country’s longest-serving U.S. diplomats to report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy’s chief executive and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that even Germany’s most important intelligence service was targeting Ankara caused much more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: locomotive drivers threaten consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand-off announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. affects all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the trade union of German locomotive drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where it wants to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
Prosecutors on Friday presented evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the Majorca Prosecutor.
The head of the police of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, after allegations of corruption against him.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvi<0xC3><0xA0> to the office of the Majorca Prosecutor for the fight against corruption on Friday.
Two other local policemen have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the annoyed nightclub owners testified that the authorities’ nephew business had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who executed Fellatio on 24 men during a sauté tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the improper behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage jointly paid a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds hampering flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 pm another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that began shortly before 8 p.m. and provided nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city dropped back to a high of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The gusty weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
At this time, wind surges reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally landed at about 8.40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in delays on some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A high temperature of 16°C is expected for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time to network
Given the galloping technological progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech hubs, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I’m writing this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the earphone to the phone, and I think, “Boah, how retro is that?”
But there is a reason behind it: if the cable were not there, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
Anyway, yes, on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that the world first of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if, for example, you still have a tube TV in the living room today, you simply say that you basically reject television.
Why these considerations?
Because the rush of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who used to blindly master the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with incomprehensible vain expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you still got it?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such a quark?
For about 20 years, it has been mainly about connecting our house.
So that the yogurt reorders itself, so that the fire detector informs us during holidays in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we got the air conditioning from the office to our soon arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely come true soon: We lift our watch, say loudly "suction!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
I'm going.
Everything is about nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred", a specialist in the industry tells us, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but which is of no use because we are in traffic.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters as rocket and mortar shelling felled on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in the south of Israel, marked by missile holes, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed grenade fragments from the walls and sliding walls before the arrival of the students.
“We’re a little scared, but excited,” said Ronit Bart, a Kibbutz Saad resident and English teacher.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt “a little weird” to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire interrupted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas farther away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza that is heavily marked by the Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, “We will make sure that their knowledge acquires and offers you security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but has not provided concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU vice-president Strobl calls into question NPD ban procedure
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to Thomas Strobl, CDU federal vice president, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD scores worse than last time," Strobl, who is also the CDU's head of state in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that lets me come to the conclusion that the NPD is opposed politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the five percent hurdle in Sunday’s vote.
A first push for a ban on the far-right party failed in 2003, because at that time the constitutional protection also had informants in the NPD’s top.
In December 2013, after a long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central First Reception for Refugees in Harburg is bursting out of all seams.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only briefed shortly before - they are little excited.
"These Hauruck actions continue to incite reservations from citizens and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, the group's chairwoman in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of seekers for help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday’s RP data.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s head of research, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a split market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have only risen by 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless went on to say that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale for the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test".
“If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate, and the persistently low interest rate environment, it’s likely that home prices will continue to rise even further in the next three months,” he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him to pose "like a fieldman".
This is not the style of the university, the statement said.
The Medau family had already been informed orally in mid-June about the intention of the university.
The statement that the plans were only made known in July is definitely wrong,” said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which was necessary for the access, was also less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
There was, and is, no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
The current level is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will then only be used by students of the university in the future does not want Pötzl to apply.
There is no parking at all, because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking lots.
Think of the locals
According to the university president, the Bergwichtel nursery, which is located on the site and in front of whose front door would lead the access to the parking deck, should not be affected.
Rather, he points out, "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the mouth of the Friedrich-Streif-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring Realschule.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental advisory board of the nursery, with the extension of the street would be justified one of "the few natural spots of Coburg lost", "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context to address the importance of the new development".
Last week, Peer Medau informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the entrance to the new parking deck is not to pass through the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but through the Medau-Berg.
This would have to extend the narrow road to about one kilometer in two lanes.
According to estimates of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
So far, the city did not want to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited above all health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 world champion said on his Facebook page.
With a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany, he is retiring internationally.
Because the huge backroom player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his squad for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will delight my long-time teammates and successors.
But for my club I want to be healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two more interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional career and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never got my blood pressure under control properly.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I realized that while I control my head, I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview.
For a comeback, he would only be ready in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes are torn, I am always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he won the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
Crises around the world slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
The Federal Statistical Office announced this and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone boosted the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, the overall GDP growth for the first half of the year was 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led on Sunday for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the biggest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour of the Münsterland.
This tour was advertised in various specialist magazines and was offered to those interested.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to participate in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering at the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace journey" through the city over the wall, where the launch took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
The cyclists proved their good condition on routes of 95 kilometres with 1,175 metres of altitude, 120 kilometres with 1,475 metres of altitude and 145 kilometres with 1,775 metres of altitude.
They were fed on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization went smoothly and there were no negative incidents,” Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 with hopefully nice weather on August 30th or during another weekend", but the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, in "Mönch und Krieger" on 287 pages on paper.
Not chronologically, but more bits of thought for bits of thought, the Munich native, born on June 1, 1947, has written down his memoirs, each chapter being initiated by a matching lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From onania as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness out.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes up abstract, but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only the music shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting all unnecessary".
But between all the high-spirited views, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride in which he targeted a tree frontal.
He is also ruthlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
One never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Stop the roar.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — who were grown up when I was a child — went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he could wash the foundry from himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Henry grew up as a child without any love from his parents.
My dad never hugged me, he never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother was ill at the end of her life that we began to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been taken in by the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public eye, but also from 1975 to 1985 I learned how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people "painted themselves black," Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish somehow it never happened, but I don’t regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just taking the time or stepping a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was mostly a middle class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello’s last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right on.
“That’s what it’s about, it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn’t believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt he needed to entertain the audience.
“A small voice told me, ‘You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.’”
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That too was good, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNING voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been filled with humorous outbursts while he keeps imitating people.
I have decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn’t give me as much as it used to.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey – I don’t think I ever want to give up on that.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shia Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Huthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Huthi party said.
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are calling for the government’s resignation.
The Houthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there is always bloody fighting with the Yemeni army.
Kenya Registers Officials to Curb ‘Ghost Workers’
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all state officials to remove “spirited employees” from the government’s payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service when he took office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) per month was lost in payments for “mind workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital Nairobi told the BBC.
All officials must now appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure their biometric registration data is recorded, a government news release said.
Anyone who did not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the statement continued.
"This approach will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also cleaning up the salary list at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'spiritual employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding compensation of 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
This was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and vintage cars and that Berthold Albrecht had charged higher purchase prices than were actually paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He served in school for 44 years, 23 of which were school principals.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see the human being in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, they went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
Thus Richter swallowed it to the Upper Frankonian village of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954, after three years as a teacher candidate, the second state examination.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Miss Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were combined in Petershausen in the current city hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building from September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Richter’s retirement.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workshop built on municipal costs and cellars built during the 1997 expansion, although this was not eligible according to the guidelines for school buildings.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report of a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to know: "This is not always possible." Whether he means only his students or his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter’s doing was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils fought each other, they did not receive penal work from him, nor were they given to sit down.
At the expense of the community, Judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Judge as rector maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to run for council in 1996, at least as the last one on the CSU list.
But Judge was elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop at the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland, it is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of stops alone made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour together with the accompanying stross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday, it got serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 km via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the Bad Salzhausen own business, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, swab, scattered and cheese cakes, which spoke wonderfully to the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be purchased at the drinks stand of the gymnasium Geiß-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park was relaxing.
A man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, he has already reattached jumping bicycle chains today."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking spa by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotional head Tobias Hagen, who has been on the tour since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was only able to take a short break, because he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his employees and the 15-man motorcycle squadron of the Hesse Police using three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the resort when they left after one and a half hours: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, they had prepared treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a member of the Board of Management of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move vividly in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens increasingly mingled, as well as the large crowd of cyclists, who were just as impressed with the good mood.
On the second day, the cyclists had the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalder - on the programme.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against government
A total of 33 policemen have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies report.
The police did not immediately comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly founding an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and others in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Jazenjuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She arrives with a proud towel of fame from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Chairman of the Board of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation was reportedly almost <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, as he sought more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the job of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inside on the first guard of one’s own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new-coming president would run the risk of stepping up, hitting everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps killing himself in the process.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC scaled down – power, money, and status outdated.
As competition moves closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys into the surely largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and important institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry of Texas says downgrading tweet was unauthorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a downgrading comment about the Democratic District Attorney, who is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry’s user account, which rescinded the previous one.
Just sent a tweet from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and have deleted it,” the tweet said.
Perry employees did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets went out of Perry’s official user account, it wasn’t clear who actually served the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavourable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry — who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate — in front of a grand jury this month in Austin.
The tweet reads: “I don’t always drive drunk with three times the allowable alcohol level ... but if I do, I will sue Governor Perry when he talks it out.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with directing the investigation of the grand jury against Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-ranking team of attorneys asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law prosecuting the senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funding to the state’s Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and investigates state corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa Elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry responded to speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market ‘normal’
One of London’s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England had returned to normal levels.
Homesteads in the capital were highly coveted and subject to huge price increases, prompting the Bank of England to set mortgage ceilings in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,” adding that this provides a “stable environment for action.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the cadastral office, prices in the city area rose steeply by 18.5 percent last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices at Berkeley’s private, inexpensive and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year to around <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible “villa tax” ahead of the general elections next May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending regimes, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in mortgage licensing in July, also suggesting that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the 2015 London property price hike down to 3 percent, based on already weakening home price awareness.
Transaction volume in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has declined by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, as the amounts due for futures sales amount to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, forward sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year through the end of April - almost a third more than its peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>280 million annually, and sales increased by 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
In a statement Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenues for Berkeley in the current year are expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon in London.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hacker published on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and charged the hacker with "blatant breach of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will track all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple's online iCloud storage system, and the alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not certain how many of the images are real, though Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who look at photos my husband and I took years ago in the private setting of our house – I hope you’re really happy with each other,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoryus" however denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FIXED, folks.
Let’s start from the beginning. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed novel about love and the letter "J".
They decayed, it could be best described, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew it.
He was stingy, as in hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this stinginess was an affair just beginning, which had been more promising to alleviate the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluffing heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion, who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradise-like valley, aptly named Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed that they belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge cabbages.
It was like the house of a children’s fairy tale, both menacing and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had liked to sit with Ailinn hand in hand on the broken deck chairs in the high grass, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had clung in witlessly to the service console, which provided the country with black calming music and calming messages, when the sight of his long-forgotten father, in the middle of their old brown song, had forgotten a long-crossed him Beine.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was so really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsoleted, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have done, and as people in books choose from the dishwashing-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Ailinn’s big feet in a grossly comical serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
“This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller,” he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game back then, and it wasn’t funny now.
He knew that was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though it was not directly banned.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
So does the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group endowment – gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were naturally blessed with electronic talent, with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN WHEN HAPPENED—for fear of being charged with fire-screaming, even for fear that the flames would devour them next—the Labneh and Shisha pipes had been opened and the Unpressed restaurants had stopped.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just uttered to her could ever be heard.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father love such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was a little weird.
“It seemed funny to him,” he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing to see all over the world but your uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankles, a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you,” he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be weird, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he didn’t have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to, Kevern, be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her reclining chair, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palms in the storm.
“And your fat head is exactly the reason why I feel perverted attracted to you,” she said.
Except that I'm not at all.
She felt sorry for him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more annoying for WHAT HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
- Dickhead?
They would have shown her a big fist if she wasn't careful!
They only sucked - sucking was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the irrelevant love ballads from the console - they first sucked and then beat.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the sucking itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He stood up from the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the strength of her grief surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him walk away—as if her companion were watching him from an upper-floor room—a man grieved by something he himself had summoned up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was this a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before this day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short lecture on continued violence at a low and medium level in precisely those parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, was the most likely to have been the energy extinguished.
"A great deal has already been done, and much more needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has been rarely felt historically despite the towering church towers between the hedges.
But some characteristics turn out to be inexorable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, gets intoxicated with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still not only does the former rudeness hold rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence on the streets for the emergence of a new and insidious battlefield at home and at work.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal to testify.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I don’t ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and commendable, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you call “backward” and “raw,” could equally well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to ride on what is happening when it is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking its essential life force from the land.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbors, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you're going to do," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, as she was sure her supervisor had finished talking, "and I say nothing but that we're not yet as effectively healed as we're deceiving ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that only led to WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED.
This time, however, it is not the others in whom we let out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you call actions "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about them leaving out their “angry” and “distrust” of “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of disorder, that’s all we know.
“Of which, if we are honest with ourselves,” Esme dared indulge, “no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was it back then.
There is nothing more to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt has to be attributed, so no guilt has to be cleared if such a redemption is appropriate and if there is a way to erase it.
But what is the past for if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I may say anything about it -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who, as described by passersby, had driven on the footpath in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official military officials in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the country’s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting of threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup de facto, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armament was imminent by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the Lesotho defense staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that within the police some elements were acting that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a crash.
“While no one has claimed to have robbed the government by force, all reports have agreed that the activities of the Lesotho defense forces so far show signs of a coup d’état,” he said.
Lesotho’s military spokespersons said Sunday that the soldiers are retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital is calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the administration during Thabane’s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there has been great tensions since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings over clashes in his united government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, in spite of differently worded accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely monitored study.
The final Markit Purchasing Manager Index of the Manufacturing Industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a 51.8 in July.
A statement above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined, and factories experienced break-ins at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan to deal with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the imminent deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week on whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, the PMI fell to 46.9 in the bloc’s second-largest economic nation, France.
France remains a child of concern, as does the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives are no longer taking hold in the key industrial mechanism in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are also not reassuring,” said Mr. Dobson.
The decline of the industry is probably fueling the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say for the August purchasing manager index of the eurozone manufacturing industry is that after that the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as current heightened geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be “increasingly likely” that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a type of QE, “although we suspect this will be limited.”
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night warned the heroic survivors of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into disgust, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them die - now comes to an end.
The girl photographed in the attempt to climb back into the torn school gymnasium
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she only tried to climb back into the shattered school gymnasium after a mine exploded.
Totally confused, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were overflowing with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier rescued her.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'll have to be operated on again.
Some shrapnel is still on my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“That happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes a little weaker each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and help keep things from happening again.
The boy who fled through the bullet, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she might be dead, he fled and saw a weeping toddler along the way, grabbed him by the hand and fled through a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who embraced his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and suffered leg injuries in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say it gets paler in my memory.
I know I threw away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who didn’t make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities,” said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borschtsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are just children like ours.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes laying down on the sofa, his face turned away from us, for hours.
He was not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can’t believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
“I remember calling him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that’s how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image became a symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-soaked face was frightened as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed to take her eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer that date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always haunt me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
Impressive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanting to go to school that day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.
Georgij does not like to see the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People keep examining such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is turning into something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing at all in such pain.
It takes us tens of years to forget a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall when September 1st is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived even though he was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijev was trapped at the foot of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I've left behind.
I’m older now and people say that kids can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm physically fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s intelligence academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, and they should not, of course, suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse as the anniversary draws closer.
I will go to the memorial celebrations.
I know Georgy won't go.
It must be even more violent for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so thankful to God that it was returned to me. Here in Beslan, everyone is drawn of it.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept this when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only aggravated my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My Son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby who was so grippingly carried by a Special Operations Command in safety
Saved: Aljona Tskajeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but in their cruelty kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gymnasium.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
“They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man Accused of Driving Girl on Fife Pedestrian Crossing
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of approaching a girl on the transition at Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, dismissed the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the process for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a choice of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a price under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the insulated underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Closely approach the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It’s especially important when you’re working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they’re to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthesiologist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the patients both from the agony of the disease and from the agonies of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and illnesses are important to doctors, while those treated are predominantly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I was having trouble getting upset.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it immediately than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have been smokers in the past.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems to be scarcely worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as from traffic accidents.
Annual Numbers of Mesothelioma Deaths Since 1980 and Estimated Future Deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999, all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and often is, present in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the shops we shop in.
Therefore, mesothelioma does not know class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from London’s elegant department stores to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healed, we have already been identified as the source of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a plumber either.
Indeed, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It looks like a lot of asbestos is present in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I was trained for six years,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
Wondering how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question, at least in part.
“Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy’s Hospital and who had mesothelioma in the last five years,” he wrote in a 2010 letter, “I am the last one who is still alive.”
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma sufferers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are going to get sick?”
The UK’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to stop, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A brief look at the court files, which are often addressed by the affected for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations – one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her career at M&S.
She now has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to one substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a "great health risk" with a possible consequence of death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is by no means uncommon.
He submitted a study of those affected, stating that “a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure to work or at home was presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment.”
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings, he says.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service bays and pipelines behind the parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion of work will have to be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernize the green electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections, the Q-centre will be more likely to meet the Westminster than the Q-centre.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve been working on, and the data.
What he still remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old and had an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had a chill.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the chest skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Amazed doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleural catheters to remove fluid from his lungs and test it in the lab.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often following exercise and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient from Abbotts came to his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the ribbon and chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos,” he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for treating doctors.
It is still removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
It’s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And meanwhile, such innocent items in our homes, such as floorboards or shed roofs, have asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in large parts of our properties,” notes Andrew Morgan, the attorney who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch out as you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
“It was very hard to take it all,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-sustaining mechanism – breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspected exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their hospital training.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, highly controversial.
Some think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest coat," he says.
You don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," the "effect shows", but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he presented himself cheerfully on calls.
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in that I didn’t have to be referred, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for the treatment to be approved.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best therapies available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers are left with another financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low load represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation," as Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation into his death, however, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it is an enormous problem to attribute the lethal asbestos contact to a company or workplace – usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there have been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to file for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million insurance industry-funded fund for all those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but can’t sue anyone.
In these cases, plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages process - about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million was a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal of insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers should have paid if time hadn’t gone by and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths a day, rapid action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which he expects to have a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
“Of course, that’s the most important thing,” says Abbott.
We see this again and again in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you're going to get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
It's life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This move is likely to fuel the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
“It doesn’t come unexpectedly, but it does make us angry,” said Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said that admitting public nominations in the elections would be too “chaotic” for Hong Kong’s government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has vowed to have residents elect the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is keeping the process firmly in hand through a tightly controlled Beijing nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most popular protests in Hong Kong in several years took place.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters within hours of the announcement.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online message, the organizers said the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and there were tighter security measures in front of the government building on Sunday, including police forces and barricades.
The riots are compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement’s demonstrations for endangering business operations – the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they're talking about could do great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will go out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on suffrage, in which 780,000 people participated – more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of high school graduation balls in the US is now being transferred to universities where freshmen are offered performances by private aircraft.
We are excited to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service to students today.
In order to make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings through the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been launched, but added that “students would book the service in the coming weeks.”
The company also announced that despite the <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year tuition fee, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as lifted.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice President for Higher Education said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest basics of living before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists Criticize Racial Issues and Police Behavior According to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants raised their hands in the air and chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest escalated and received attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women revolved 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays came relatively late with titles such as “Thoughts about Ferguson from a White Woman” and “Feminism is not just about the repression of women.”
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
“I don’t think you’ll find a lot of people in feminism who are about being white and talking about privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Coritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in the public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman,” said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women fighters for women’s suffrage like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to stand up for women’s suffrage, and the suffrage for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become powerfully aware of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to Ferguson's questions - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fishing" with the problems that black women have been battling for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to educate a child as seriously as they do the right to control conception?” asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who have built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what that means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll calling for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a threat inherent in the body — and opinions about race that are markedly different in public surveys — will lead the changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are still astonishing.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson stand in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that is pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also resurfaced – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to rethink the issue as an essential women’s issue, they simply had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are resonating in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig who had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"However, the photo was mistakenly posted and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the house's exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique one-bedroom detached house."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale sparked interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still has to register.
The store owner Steve Forward said the profit was for conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city isn’t talking about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated first division wins last month, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made the mega-win of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win allowed them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the gladiator's arena
It was not only the gladiators who stood knee-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely enthralled by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful rattling of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Roman era and its significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force from the Gladiator's School "Amor Mortis", which used each rain break to demonstrate its sturdy martial arts in the sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men one by one into the ring for heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "Provocateurs" were on the line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and worm as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who attacked the "Secutor" with a net, a trident and a dagger and, after a short fight, knocked the boy to the ground.
Then the swords crashed metallic, the shields snapped and the worms flew whispering through the arena that one could become afraid and anxious for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an ever-attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era liveable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became a "Oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired during Roman Day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft confronted the water and energy supply once and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "Today we still benefit from the knowledge of then."
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heating that once heated the Römervilla.
Impressively also the footprints that were left by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the office for soil monument maintenance at the State Association of Rhineland unearthed the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
The surrounding walls of a commercial building were found with a darre for drying grain and malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations were presented in a glass showcase, including a large plate, several fine glass jars and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the Germanic invasion of the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
At her, the children also engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal claws on waxboards, as the Roman pupils once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and serve a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim to grind the flour for a flatbread or a muesli.
With the originally replicated Roman travel car drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented here the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also bring itself into the Roman Year 2014, proclaimed throughout the Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtsvereine as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remind us of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the vigorous Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era and a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and attracted Romans.
As part of a project week, the Adendorf Primary School is dedicated to the Roman theme.
With the Römerwoche, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be experienced again.
In the town hall of Wachtberg, a small presentation will remind you of the find of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: Epidemic strains West African economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned – and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is hitting the West African economy.
The crop is rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has seriously affected the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second-largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
On the market only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, with more than 600 people suffering from the fever alone.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died and thousands more have been imprisoned.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in resource-rich countries, companies are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also react: only a few merchants still leave their hometowns to procure supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, cocoa and coffee beans important for export are rotting in the fields, among others.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Paris-based expert on the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is in danger of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
It is important to know how far and how long the virus will spread.
“Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also affects the stressed state budgets of the states
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets will be heavily strained by the high expenditures on the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to provide $60 million (€45 million) to the health systems of the affected countries.
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people already remain at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also going down significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, preparations are underway for the 50th anniversary of the foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a big evening of conversation with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big bullfighting.
Afterwards, the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" will be held in the big party tent.
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the great march at 2 pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association for "social entertainment through exercise in room- and small-caliber shooting" was founded.
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men meet again, who on April 30th in the inn Lukas raised the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter master through a difficult early period, in which it was mainly about finding a club venue and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965 the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, which were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records burst every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club no longer met the demands of a modern shooter club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Father Strasser granted the Church’s blessing for the new shooter rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gaussian shooting, coupled with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On April 23 and 24, 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a Boller Group was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round-robin competitions
You can also see the sporting performances of the shooter club.
A total of eleven teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air gun team, one KK1 sports gun, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann climbed from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has ascended from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bockstechen, carnival and royal ball, club trip and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
Team Principal Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team is disappointed but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"Today I went with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tugboat and the team had packed up and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in northern New York state.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the chase.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart will face an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already advanced into the first 10 shortly thereafter and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs
Car with No. 18 out of control after exiting Turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Dance-loving youngsters wanted
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to collaborators.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn also create full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now we are looking for more young people for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more actives, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can enjoy the training hours on Thursdays between 5pm and 6pm or on Fridays between 5pm and 6pm in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociability is not too short.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance films and we've stayed in the dance room before," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not like that, you can also sniff into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and teenagers can always get a taste of the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you like Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have staged a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite meetings between the prison workers’ union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, the Director-General for the implementation of penal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison employees is expected to be supported by members of the union Association of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold Luhansk on Monday.
At the same time, the army said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter plane and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents told Russian agencies on Monday.
Ships of the Coast Guard sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Azov Sea for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships were under fire on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesperson in Kiev told broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital, Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicize their demands.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the 1997 NATO-Russia Council.
The head of NATO, however, accused Russia of "a gross breach" of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and statements from the Russian side, it is apparent that "they consider us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A “Readiness Action Plan” to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as it is necessary,” Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on further talks to resolve their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still awaiting a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says power word: Toll will come "completely clear"
Now the Chancellor is making a clear commitment to this.
However, it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the passenger car tolls have increasingly infuriated the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To put it quite clearly: she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," the party leader said Monday after meetings of the CDU's top bodies in Berlin.
But for now, Merkel has not been committed to a detailed model.
In the black-and-red government program, “certain parameters” are called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and it is now being worked on".
The NRW CDU, however, insists on its no toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other options to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is examining its own concept to compensate motorway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
“The coalition agreement never presumed to paint all district and federal roads,” said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country president.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll could affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU.
The Left sees the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads, which is supposed to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers according to EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic Disorder Often Misdiagnosed
One Briton says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) — a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she suffered from Friedreich ataxia (FA) – a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two, who is now 51 years old, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same thing as the others.
I fell down all the time and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to ride roller skates or skateboards with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not diminished as much as she had imagined and interviewed her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was found.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former army training ground
For almost ten years, no more shots have been fired at the former military training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
An ear deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere area during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen Troop Training Centre, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6,500-hectare area has been the core of the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study last week, and Washington-area companies were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent from 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden on companies rose 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining measures in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from businesses.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large portion of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to apply to the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues, as property taxes here amount to just over one-fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, a large portion of the property, especially in the D.C. tax area, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Corporate revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on state-owned organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly at all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate at 6 percent in all three departments (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local corporate taxes and overall a better tax climate than Maryland.
The district was not investigated in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and so they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people — a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized by — in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a markedly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with general non-profit tax revenues for the state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government’s spending cut affects the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," Li Yiwei, deputy secretary of the South China metropolis, said this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Over and over again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolises in the course of the talks.
Guangzhou, also called the canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, Li said.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German politician delegation, told the host that he would look for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou came up with Shepherd's Gumbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Purity Law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice Party Leader Li said.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
“Business between our two cities continues to grow.”
Currently, travelers have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The province’s deputy governor, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his talks with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Maintained partnership
The gentle deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not yet in this role.
He did not come into office until this year after his predecessor was removed from office on charges of corruption.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The move against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car manufacturer VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese association was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as all of Hesse.
Next year, it aims to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers' family "squeezes their thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We all press our fingers.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that will come on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September, on which the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, higher nitrogen oxide values apply in the "Euro 6" class of pollutants.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they will receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a host of other things – buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided on for a cool billion, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was only founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their brews in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-knowledges give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up a bit bored, a textbook example of an established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come to fruition, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they prefer to play sports rather than watch it, it’s hard to grasp the attraction of watching others play instead of taking the control console into your own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something else to watch a freak being shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there’s not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube Twitch could have simply swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being recruited as advertisers.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even — swallowed — as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
“That was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident on early Saturday, when the first visitors made their way to the open air.
A celebration for all generations was promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stations on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings, had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, waved their foot in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were required.
And this across the generations.
While some saddled on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others sat on a quarter of wine in the winery, the offspring raged on the bouncing castle, which was a great attraction for the younger guests.
But even in children’s make-up, the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to master the urge and conjure imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew organized from saltweed.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he ransacked the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
However, the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from this.
“There were more people coming than expected,” said Ron Sem, who spoke of “success all the way.”
Therefore, there is nothing against a repetition of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the popular vote.
He said it was annoying that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who strolled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks<0x60>n<0x60>Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire breakdown.
"But they will be there next year," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful in terms of the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated on the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to inject criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don’t see the initial problems as close.
I find it very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hat off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to put down these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg’s landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be inserted into the distinctive structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom, with a diameter of 47.5 meters, will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size is still a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap change
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
As far as the weather is concerned, the event will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so loudly when her icy water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming so loudly at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she cut off her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when her icy water was poured over her head that she hurt her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaw just stopped,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw that too and almost laughed, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to get her jaw reinstated after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon get back on track?
Lastly, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereine.
Now the Board of Directors is thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the castle in Wolfratshaus, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the castle friends in Wolfratshaus, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction seemed quite different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the association boards Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once,” Sjöberg said.
He believes that all the members of both clubs will be able to come together again in the future.
Thus, visible successes can be seen more quickly.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until last in mind a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle friends, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September at a general meeting.
The club currently has about 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, out of respect, we first put the club's activities to rest. This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current mood image within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, Piffl says.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer would like to work on the project "but very much to continue".
The different points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Due to the high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I have come to believe more and more that it makes sense to push the project forward. It can be created a "all-employment feature" for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I personally do not want to simply throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the castle club may move something on this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story is "important and good".
After that you could see on.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, almost second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a lending system for books from high-semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
“My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-keks,” said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college board said that on average, students spend more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there are different cost mitigation options available to the students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Leasing textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books were rented from college bookstores last spring semester, Neebos vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t care about the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if past spending is allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Renting
Leasing textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them, and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the rules of the business you are renting from, including the penalties that may apply for writing notes, underlining or signs of use.
Tenants beware: If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
eBooks
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics these days can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Definitely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for book pricing, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" wasn't a box office hit
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" spent less than $30 million on his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only made $12 million on his $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-sized film "Sex Tape" made only $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Lightly 2" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason for the children’s films.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films to date, describing "dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launch shown between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year on at least 2,000 screens.
The results are based on the opinions of moviegoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming jungle book movie, told Hollywood Reporter, “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the currently weak box office results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, when revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on making comics and prophesied a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in box office results as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporters, "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of streamlining the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Association has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
The result: Whoever has not ascended has descended.
Göttingen’s top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the descent, but will only play fifth in the coming season.
Fourth-class torpedo women remain, despite their grandiose march through to the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs represented.
For the women, TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class in terms of composition is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here from the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the Bezirksliga.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends its girls to the small district league.
The SCW boys' district league squad - there Torpedo II still starts - is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Squadron are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others, play in the Eastern Season.
The women's Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no women’s teams at the level of the circle.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd-circle classes achieve set strength, and the innovative and dynamic district board will have to think about it.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
For us, Stephen Fairclough followed the developments over the weekend and spoke with demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenage boy flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were brought to safety with the rope wind after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govett’s Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search group of local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 11 p.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had his head opened.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were admitted to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The roughly 1,000 demonstrators were pushed by soldiers from the PTV building, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed its broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial staff.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometre away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, there were again clashes with security forces by about 3,000 demonstrators on Monday.
According to hospital reports, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to penetrate Sharif’s residence.
They are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military on Sunday evening after a meeting at the army headquarters called for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using violence".
The statement said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has fueled concern about military intervention, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially endured peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them over the weekend to advance to Sharif’s residence.
Hütteldorfer after second win of the season on third place of the table.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the end in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who advanced in third place with green and white.
Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes with a success experience into the national game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said defending back Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his glorious lead volleyball from the sixteenth corner.
“I thought I was getting all the frustration out of Thursday and snuck him under the lattice,” the 26-year-old said smilingly.
When Schrammel had met on November 13, 2010 for the last time so far in a Bundesliga match, that was still for Ried.
He will therefore be remembered for the first time in the Rapid-Dress.
"For me, this is something very special, I am from the Rapid junior," Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in the mirror.
He deserved the goal, he has already played some assists this year,” Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2-0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we were lucky today," Schrammel said, referring to the split between performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results did not vote, but the game was always good compared to last year."
Barisic said he had been “better than today in many games before” – against “the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season.”
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that they have character."
For him, no less pleasing: "That we finally played too zero again".
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures are to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting eleven debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget this," said Barisic, who lost the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The national game break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and add a bit to the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his ranks.
One who is particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself for the team, goes over it in pain.
Especially at this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” said Barisic.
Hofmann not only gave Rapids the structure, but also scored the second goal before it was replaced in the 68th minute.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "We must not believe that now everything is good" "We have certainly also been a bit lucky, but at some point luck must also come back to us.
It was high time,” Hofmann said.
He warned, of course, to continue concentrated work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as we’ve shown.
But we must not believe that now everything is good.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help with right now.
At some stages, they stick to me,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick hit "from the magic gate" as well as the regular goal from Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongly dismissed by referee Kollegger.
The only reproach I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards goal in some phases.
We have had too few grades.
Internal defender Maximilian Karner looked similar: "It started just badly, but then we found in and even scored a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
Underneath this summit there is peace
We showed a powerful tribe at our riddle run of the summer series "Mein Stück vom Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the county, the specimen shown is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes past domes, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees in the area and is reminiscent of an American mammoth tree with a circumference of more than eight meters.
A small Buddha on a stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite extensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archiv and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what it has to do with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his investigations remained the fairly sober explanation for the name.
Until about 80 years ago, the goat herders were supposed to have driven their animals from sub-white fountains onto the fields that had been toiled and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal shepherds who were exhausted from the ascent are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds actually graze again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crucifixion.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other paths are signposted, climbing in the direction of Hochrhön and inviting for an extended hike.
Where is the Water Castle?
However, a water castle, which is sought in our next task, is rather rare to find in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have in the district some historical buildings to which the building counterfeit could fit.

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy’s Prime Minister and current EU President, Matteo Renzi, has pushed through the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy against strong conservative resistance at last week’s EU Special Summit.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica puts it, the appeal of his Mogherini, also a favourite in the government team, to strengthen the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the ever-contesting left-wing party base against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit rather in a moderate way.
Compared to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council Donald Tusk, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, a political balance will be established.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that the Mogherini, who has been in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for her ambition, will be able to meet the “enormous challenges”.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 as a political scientist with a doctorate in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined forces with the Catholic Centre Party Margherita in 2008 to form today’s social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party policy, working in the foreign policy department, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on the NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The accusations in Brussels that the new EU foreign representative has too little diplomatic experience, i.e. lack of substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, mainly by Poland and the Baltic members, the suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe while bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to an economic summit in Milan for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is a trainee who has already completed another training in the company.
The new employees will work in four apprenticeships in the future: electronics technicians (three apprentices), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended primary or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all grades as well as the trainers go to a team-building event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company employs 435 people throughout Germany and 950 people worldwide.
The number of apprentices distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should “shut their mouths and put France in order,” said Francois Hollande’s most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has been met with disapproval by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong calls for a loosening of the regulation by Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Hollande urged his co-socialists to show “united” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprinkled sand in the transmission, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "believing in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the Socialists’ ongoing trench fights, saying she could not imagine the new Valls government going on for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one won't survive the fall or winter either," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of winning early elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to achieve economic improvement and record unemployment.
“There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise ahead of $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise line provider, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry connoisseurs.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele, while competing with major rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals around $29 billion and is expected to grow in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to U.S. regulators for IPO in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company, according to regulatory authorities.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly hold 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original Prestige Cruises IPO filing documents.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law on Sunday that allows only two or three candidates to run for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed by members loyal to Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be admitted to the election and prompted pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and cripple Hong Kong financial center with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which outlined China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li’s interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee’s Legal Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced they would gather in front of the leadership’s office in Hong Kong in the afternoon.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin calls on Kiev to start ‘state talks’ with eastern Ukraine
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that its status vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: help for the separatists in occupying territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossiya to effectively become independent for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorosia" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians’ campaigns for the Oct. 26 elections and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hope for soon-to-be peace talks “caught in their illusions,” Itar-Tass reported.
"We need to immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification on correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underlined Russia’s claim to leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period showed a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his June 7 inauguration speech, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation should consider additions to the constitution, after new elections, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armaments and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed another incursion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoasovsk by hand, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are near a point where there is no going back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were imprisoned by the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who presumably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of the A celebrities from Hollywood.
The film city is in turmoil after a series of unambiguous photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have surfaced on the Internet in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tributes of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were also reportedly published due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who was engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “shameful” and that those affected “feel hurt.”
The hacker probably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is upstairs without being in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actress Browning were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative told TMZ: “It’s an abominable violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing other than the sale of hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the re-distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclers, joggers and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and have thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for the others.
However, they all agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler brewery rode up the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good.
He can easily put away the small muscle soreness, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
“I know now that I can – great!”
A little whisper on the way to the applause curve?
If I had stopped, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants yesterday tormented themselves to mountains in the early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happily on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the eleven-kilometre-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement at the start ("Too many professionals, there is the destination!"), but then turned out to be a semi-professional on the mountain and went through the destination after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He, too, crossed the track in a slip, as did Nina Kuhn, the press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel, who had made her way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning in order to trample back uphill.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung himself into the saddle at 9 o'clock in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
They also had “Fritten-Toni”.
For the chef of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are just a part of it.
He had run for 40 minutes on his 6.5-kilometer race bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He has to be, because he was on the "Fixie-Wheel", although these are also road bikes, but without gearbox...
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also a jogger who rode a car tire with weights behind him on a cord, proved that it was easy to go up without a wheel.
Bergwacht-Doktor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with four-wheeled bullies and quads, ensured safety, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sledge trail, only that he pulls the sledge himself.
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent on the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 am.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
