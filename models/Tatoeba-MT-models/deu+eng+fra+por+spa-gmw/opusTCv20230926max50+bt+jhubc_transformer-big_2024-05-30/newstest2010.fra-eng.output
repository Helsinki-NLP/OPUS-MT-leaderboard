Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours and be the fourth US president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s schedule then includes an interview with Norway’s King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the prize within the Committee.
The White House said in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that he receives this award as a president who is waging war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque worth ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
It intends to donate to charities, but it has not yet concretely decided which.
His busy schedule will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Head of Government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price in the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He has also repeated several times that it is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the Association of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal gain in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, a spokesman for the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, it would take you several minutes before you find the right dumpsters.
I do not mean that we would not sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the city councillors in our city, the second largest city in the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of waste sorting not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't like it, but it doesn't seem to me that much.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So finally, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a jog to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any colored dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
It is after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, isn't it?!
It is probably that ecology and a so-called aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my impression with official statistics after hanging out on the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the entire region South Moravia.
Paroubek's budget removed pensions and sick leave from money
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or public servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, said Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems to later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest on borrowed money is increasing and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If he does not cut social assistance or spending, he will have to raise taxes.
To all those that the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater state debt - next year there will be no shortage of $163 billion in coffers, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will thus grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to raise VAT slightly or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be $5 billion left to complete road and rail construction because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started and which cannot be modified in order to reduce costs.
Keep them at best, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skillfully - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (supplier and distributor of electric energy), which the state has for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the elimination of ecological damage, to supplement the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
In addition, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international proceeding, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, in the worst case, hit the government’s budget reserve.
A further $100 million is missing from the two-billion-dollar State Fund project, which is designed to track the expenditures of each administration online.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would be imposed, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another at the push of a single button.
The projects that have been revealed look promising.
Just one button and you’ll switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
It is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to the devices in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains troubles hoteliers
Deserted runways are not only a problem for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski holidays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to make a reservation at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, who operates the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only then, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler are currently offering only one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to put them in for a while, but they too will give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week we are most interested in at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still, let's say, half the rooms left in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared a few cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> tourism agency can also offer the New Year in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer open spaces.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays was negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to start falling.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Polish and February also sells well," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> is also eighty percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly still grow, said the manager of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards, the weather is expected to warm up, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comic, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, president with the reputation of a wise man, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he himself considered as very simple.
When he ended up letting his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending further reinforcements into a civil war-torn Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be so successful that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least scammed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It succeeded in stripping the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What is causing the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same fruits as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out by the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what is convenient to them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity on the relationship, which is still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of the war for their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
We will have to respond to this, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will, however, bring about a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only hardship for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executive employees at US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Shares can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it planned to allocate a one-time tax of fifty percent to banker bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
Five women, a record number, have today received in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden the Nobel Prizes in technical and literary disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquisition of the Monetary Award.
It reaches ten million Swedish kroner in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has multiple winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
The latter, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable to obtain peace, even if the price of it is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is weighing his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed of the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her role on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted for signature by Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the proposals of the left on money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement has arisen between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that questions the future of Fischer's cabinet that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government and which he says must curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but has nothing to do with it, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "unrestrained deficit" of public finances.
At present, he believes, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is staggering and the government should challenge its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words “drastic verdicts.”
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD leader Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is staggering and will exceed 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD described the ratification of the state budget for the coming year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to Play Mandela in New Clint Eastwood Movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invincible will expose to the world a lot about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was an eighty-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama set in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of a movement against slavery that has become himself a slave, a fictitious president of the United States, and even God in the movie Evan Almighty's as well as anyone's important Mana.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and South African rugby team captain Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
“I had no other purpose but to play this role in a way that brought it closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dine with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like how you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, it opened up to me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’”
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under director Eastwood has received positive reviews and is even talking about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In film ratings on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only admitted yesterday to testing an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly off, or she got damaged in mid-flight.
Russian Newspapers Say “Bulava” is a “Non-Flying Missile”
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial was normally conducted at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was obviously the third-stage engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew out of the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged.
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot talk about failure at all.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only touched the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and they therefore still assert that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will take away even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will perform again in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a helping hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to fix some details on the form, said club coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will affect only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he won the Canada Cup as well as the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k of Hyundai factory confirmed this.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can put a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holiday seasons indicated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and demands of unions and employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions plan to cancel the strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and so-called hoaxes.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to meet the imperatives of car production.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also called for workers who have ceased production not to be subjected to any sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a remuneration of 5,000 crowns (209 €) for these.
The Hyundai automotive plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles by September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Works on “Enduring” HIV Viruses Also
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the upper hand over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically modified.
A bit weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metallocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications, are therefore interesting combinations to consider further to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, Director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
Dispute over the budget. The SDG attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek called the ratified budget for the following year "shocking" and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS remarks a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether he supports the minority in the Chamber of Deputies who are concerned about tackling the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDGs and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, but proposed changes of up to 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The House has increased money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the Social Democrats' proposals was that they were indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that an amended budget be a less bad alternative to an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment on Monday with the Prime Minister after his time in government:
At the same time, he said he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment in the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those that affect health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDG have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of leading a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I did not think about it and once it will be on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the House to journalists, Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government precisely by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew out in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDGs backtracked at the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked Democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We don't feel like orphans, we're not small children," he said, responding to the question of whether the SDG had not been reproached by the party president in the House or in the country during the budget negotiation.
I didn't notice that my vote was missing.
I already knew by the time I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolshevization of the House and a destruction of all that was positive,” Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will eliminate or limit some less-loaded express or regional trains from December 13 and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by two percent on the day the new schedules enter into force compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by eight percent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> nádra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The invoice this year for the regional railways: 200 million crowns more.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year a total of 4 billion crowns to pay for visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of 8 billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in the amount of almost 3 billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of transport tickets.
Changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels still hold more than 50 people, children released
The rebels kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was AFP that informed, but originally said only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight o'clock, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police initially prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the southern Philippines province of Maguindanao because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
The new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood arrives in American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid went back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and audiences is heard.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds high hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football World Cup, and on the other hand because the media is agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflict and discrimination of residents by the ruling black majority.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are at the moment quite positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations made about the main roles where Hollywood stars "wave".
Morgan Freeman is, in his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I prepared myself well.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said at the film’s official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film is based on the story of the novel of the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to pick up two racial groups from a long divided population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is dressed in the national jersey of the South African team on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in uniting people back into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are skeptical, however, as he recently admitted in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
In the morning a fire engulfed a transformer of the <0xC4><0x8C>eps company of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesperson of the company Pavla Mandatova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in the course of ten years of operation, <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything like this and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, says <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company spokeswoman for North Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission assemblies and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transmission assemblies to the distribution assemblies and lines with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file complaint for defamation against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will today file a libel complaint against three Democratic social prefects.
And specifically against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the region of South Moravia, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka from the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura indicated it in Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál's Dvacet minut.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and claim that we are making the finest mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they wished for themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the company Student Agency, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint represents the continuation of his media spectacle which serves him as a free publicity for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable steps of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of the railways for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a course of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to threats from a <0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He has presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci will overturn old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
The specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccinations for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
To date, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns per year on all vaccination of children.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions regarding a possible vaccination requirement in the future.
As of January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that we must now follow, said Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said its spokesperson Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteerism has its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be considered "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a large amount, I understand the decision making vaccination optional," Cabrnochová said.
Experts predict that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination marks a break also because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance companies should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will need to buy their own products.
This, however, is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the sums of health insurance."
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will each have to invest around 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum theft"
Frank Frazetta’s son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) from his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press news agency reported.
AP quoted a police official as saying that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family quarrel.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies giving such a permit, the agency said.
Labour is in favour of raising the budgetary tax.
Ministers defended the tax hike and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from opposition, business and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by deferring his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also caught lightning by tackling low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling rate on public salaries from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" were foreshadowing.
The decrease in social insurance - which will get about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the business world, because he says it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be to revive the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in corporate profit tax for small companies has been abandoned
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person earning <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will gain <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 led to “hard decisions” but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the first 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms refuted a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water into the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to halve the deficit, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence how much it will borrow and how quickly the deficit will be filled - have been called into question after the Chancellor was forced to revise his initial figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely decline by 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Missed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign warning against Labour's "debt crisis" on Thursday, said the plan to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" evading difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
"They did not present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the Treasury of the Phantom Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory’s proposals that would lead to a faster and larger deficit reduction.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised through higher taxes and lower spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind."
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said that the timing of the announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda charges, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of who wins," said Roger Bootle, Deloitte Accountants Economic Advisor.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates 'American Arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who were reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also seeking information about these people.
Three of them are presented as of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are collaborating with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether or not the students are truly missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already under surveillance by local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. should “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iran's "abuses"
In the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man cited in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-compliance with human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bloody and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate in the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate the post-election disturbances and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks in an effort to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform the Bristol site into a race track.
The Track in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small springboard preceded a 100m long track.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
Good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very good at listening to and reproducing the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their advocates of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulent guardian of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “narrowness of key values”.
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can not survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved their worth in hunting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still usually one millionth of the surface needed for an adult at large. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has turned green due to the algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter fighters and Inuit Indians on motorskis use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse into what the future might be like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not because you tried.
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information about the melting of the ice cap.
Submarines from the Cold War then mapped the changes in relief underneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary, tiny world of the Arctic ice system, formed by nets of brackish water squeezed in freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it may be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on the graves in Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the veterans' graves in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military career.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine crowns over the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most of the war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, pushed into the wet earth for those whose grave had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tearful mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to gather at the grave of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget how free we are...my son paid for it, she said.
“Long after I’ve disappeared, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. Foreign Ministry officials said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and she is followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but has always been denied permission.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Cuban Communist Brotherhood and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can return the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that would be allowed in any other public company -- distributing mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his eldest brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when the two countries are starting to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities stop plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly plotting to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying it hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruits scrambling the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east that have become a refuge from terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of keeping anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men — who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI — insist on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence services have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, denying entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more attention in recent years in choosing the people they accept as the U.S. secret services have become experts in terms of their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked the streets here on Saturday demanding more climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists have marched around the city, displaying signs in English saying ‘There is no planet B’ and one in Spanish, declaring ‘The Earth says it has had enough’.
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother’s homeland, Peru, opened her eyes to the heartbreaking problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already happening.
That's one of the reasons I've decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate talks, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal that is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to watch the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that the protesters have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as China’s climate representative Su Wei.
Asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, stating, "Because the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they are disrupting negotiations or harming the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal tenacious discrepancies between breeds
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news to Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between African-American and white outcomes, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C. increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
African-American progress in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average blank result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only narrowed to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was driven by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean we raised the aggregate by looking at the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality in the District’s education.
I’m not jumping for one or two points earned,” said D.C. Council Member Kwame R. Brown, whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting elementary and early school grade students who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the math program, for Kindergarten classes at Grade 6 (6th), focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than the class,” Rhee said.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to elevate the overall results of the system while providing money and resources to schools with poorer results in order to close the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies city test results.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other school superintendents, she’s trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to receive an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements in closing the gap in success was the length of traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with her teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of a new student impressed than enthusiastic.
"That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she said a thinker, when she was told the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents as a teenager, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five Hispanics of the "second generation" is pursuing high school -- a remarkable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, and they pave the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
The researchers who study the beaters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to make up for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who don’t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that financed the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Gets Deals with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who bid lost.
Two U.S. companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of the US oil giants in the opening up of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a news website on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreat, have held back U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the world's third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to account to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and provided it with technical advice, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid more on contracts than other companies and left with significant stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on par with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to bid made bids that were then compared to the per-barrel rate the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the top al-Qaeda organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counterintelligence officials said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret service member, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Officials said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda's military organizers who directed the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somali had progressed rapidly into al-Qaeda’s ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has slowed since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures put forward by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
U.N. Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down in March after a tumultuous term tainted with widespread allegations of corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential election.
Eide's departure came as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase, but expressed concern over the U.S. timing of a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply honor the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there had been a two-month void between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives state that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about the international observation of the elections."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying it would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy UN hiring regulations hampered his opportunities to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a bed of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs the most on me is that if I’ve learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it’s the unpredictable side of war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has pointed out that some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a “set of motivations and punishments” might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons” because “its people would suffer enormously” from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “probable” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back into full compliance with the UN Security Council and its watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he said he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have drifted away from attempts at agreement – in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided over whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran’s stiffening in the face of some of the international community’s proposals for which they had actually given their agreement in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to come together on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set Dec. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “enhanced sanctions.”
In a statement on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly over borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, president of Kurdistan’s regional government: “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.”
We will not abandon you.”
In the ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching, “Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children” and “One more baby is one more tomb.”
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate in their city and the ageing population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was immediate and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to date, without a doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy risk paying huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have assigned the police a duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-girls ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slip leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing answer
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in applications for couples wishing a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu commune, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly view the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
That's right, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she wanted only one single child because she was one herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone care for us."
We’re not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more bluntly.
For middle-class couples working in pairs, who lower the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle for themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
United Nations group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference - characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations - came back under the spotlight on Friday, due to the release of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the next 40 years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it shed light on the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Drafted by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long run and in the long run.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary-General on climate change Yvo de Boer described as “the complete picture.”
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, by 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched the negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, said the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked “common sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, deficiencies have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States quarrelling over their respective obligations as poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It’s really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change said they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the negotiations will lead to a political agreement at a minimum.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission's climate unit, said that the action of the small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process", in part by what they are now unified and that they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the pending issues before heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister Ramesh got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings, so they could make claims that would be considered in the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congrès every day -- of activist guitar players presenting nighttime shows mocking countries they believe are betraying each other and proposing to be written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the courtyard of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome of Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h as it departs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter and the passage from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing road traffic jams.
In theory, the three main political parties join this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable scheduling battle and fears of environmental hazards risk slowing British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line from London to the West Midlands will be designed within five metres of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will offer three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the best performance option,” said one rail professional.
When this is complete, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400 km/h, making it the fastest British network in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal capable of accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from airplanes to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a senior member of parliament in Tory, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party official, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “entertained,” increased his loan by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a member spending check. Last night, Mr Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for fun".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Committee on Privileges and Standards into his pre-borrowing provisions.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 loan from his London property to the house of his riding which he purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was claiming around <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest through March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, unchanged since then.
The latest Commons publication shows that Mr Duncan continued to request <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him declaring that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "of the m...e"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small portion, based on what was right.
And I could have asked for a lot more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began to explain his expenses in May, after it emerged that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that it "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn, protesting after it was revealed he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in the loan, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the fees office and Legg."
He added: “There is no problem with backing up or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 homeowners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using Christmas songs as their theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30pm to 6.30pm, each day, with pastries and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the booth features the work of local artist Janette Tozer.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why are we waiting for people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
“The idea of the Advent calendar from the beach cabin came right after a conversation with a few friends, over a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people marched Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to police, some 100,000 according to organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, tasked with culminating by Friday in an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate across the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped to make "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed windows with pavements and hammers, an AFP reporter found.
Anti-riot police officers immediately intervened relentlessly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the streets Saturday evening "handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Parliamentary party, the rather good-natured procession took over the leadership of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoat, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t keep thinking: we have time,” said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of globalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas touting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for strong action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow’s recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a “farce.”
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58 per cent a few hours before the close, according to officials from the Abkhaz Election Commission.
The first preliminary results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who said she voted for Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region with lush landscapes on the Black Sea.
Extensive signs showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the progress of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, alluding to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition, represented by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: worldwide protests, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police, on the brink of death, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which until December 18 welcomes delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliamentary party, the procession, generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to penetrate.
A stage had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the departure of the procession, a group of a few hundred protesters, all dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP reporter found.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened relentlessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", the ultra-violent groups that had notably shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a policeman was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned down near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We are watching the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while police helicopters were spinning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoat, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t keep thinking: we have time,” said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that are drying up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk when you've never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalism, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "bind climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no gap between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who were expected to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had kicked off the protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas touting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital’s city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters have also been held to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Geo-history comes out reinforced by the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography are coming out "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the elimination of their compulsory education in scientific terminal.
Now, all first-graders will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we must get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S-sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "basically, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L sectors cannot remain sub-rows of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals outraged at the absence of history-geography in the terminal in technological high schools".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten French (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to remove compulsory history-geography education in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized the suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister added, however, that there was "no question" of removing the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also follow in-situ internships during the year of M2 and then will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says that he will propose "the individual right to training, something that does not exist at the National Education".
It also reaffirms the plan to abolish the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge raised Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la Rue d'Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert speeches, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school pond.
We select about twenty speakers from among the experts in their discipline and select them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, "we can talk about the hours, but we can also talk about the key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos taken from these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prison watchers' unions on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime whose payment has been postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and to "block them", to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Department of Justice explain that overtime has increased significantly in 2009 and not all have been budgeted, but assure that the remnants will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am well aware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our penitentiary system," the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for management personnel benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, lamented the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, believes the CGT-penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some less badly crowded than others.
But in any case, the account is not there, noted the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Offers ‘Owlier Tricks’ Than He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the small screen pope Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give things that are nicer than those I receive."
As part of a special show to be aired on ABC on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle offer a glimpse into how they plan to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family’s four-legged little companion, will be on the sidelines.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama falsely registered herself against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying humorously by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, in the laid-back atmosphere, with the famous hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama referred to a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father he rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than fixing it around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL says he's in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, saying the injuries had "needed a restorative operation".
The singer's press office said the situation was "under control" and that a new medical bulletin would be released within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
Interviewed by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drains would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, had been performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic field.
He wasn't available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself that he was "not worried" about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
“He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted reassurance, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "inhibited".
Mr. Camus had also said he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on from "small colon cancer" and then from a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been widely commented on, and fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's first on his fetish distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Championships in large pool, won on Thursday an international title on a distance that he particularly likes, the 50 m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while we were expecting a surge.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who was on the world record of 50 m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two main distances of swimming, the 50 m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers started against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
One can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
Originating 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which hosted the first in 1999, in the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in big pool this summer in Rome, world records in the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds on 400 m freestyle swim (3:32.77) but nevertheless prevailed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up on this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann said.
USA: a sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded 1.5 million USD
A panel of Roman sarcophagus that belonged to French writer Emile Zola has been awarded Thursday 1.5 million dollars, clearly above his estimate, the art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century A.D., was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the art auction of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, said a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Paris mansion, and with Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
There was still a shadow area of about 50 years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya’s Aborted Departure Attempt from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a safe-driving by the coup government.
For the moment, after a phone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him safe conduct.
But the ousted president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a guest incumbent head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced another failure in wanting me to resign from my office ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the fallen president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure of Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the fallen president on Wednesday, who came to rally around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government in terms of international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had moved closer to Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" that the justice system accuses him of, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but challenged by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures testifying to the recovery in both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones rose 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominant Nasdaq by 7.13 points to 2,191.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index was 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, believing that the market was focused on "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite of a widening deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, reflecting the growth of the economies of the main U.S. trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
Unemployment in the U.S. rose unexpectedly last week to 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to its lowest level in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Power Supporters Confuse 'Ladies in White'
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power conspired on Thursday with the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspired in the streets by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist found.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, with the fist lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by agents in civilians who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were arrested by police officers, an AFP journalist found.
Policemen forcibly mounted dissidents in civilian vehicles who were conspired by government supporters, the reporter said.
Arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was among the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remained in prison.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" on behalf of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man kills 80-year-old with a knife and 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), an hour away, late on Thursday.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, allegedly struck with two knives and for unknown reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, according to police sources and witnesses.
Seriously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital from his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the 80-year-old died.
The injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman was then uneasy and reportedly hospitalized "in shock," according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, still boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter severely.
The script remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried in cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the union Alliance in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the forced one.
I saw a guy in his 30s wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to interrogate the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the floor, put him in a safe position, and saw a very large wound to his abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his thirties arrived, wounded by a knife.
National police officers arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has seized the investigation from the departmental judicial police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The prisoner was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out his being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forced of this species whose forces are tenfold under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for dropping the lawsuit
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer once again demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California) that his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a more than 30-year-old morale case, be dismissed.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for the "Pianist", denounced in front of three judges of California's second district court of appeal serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the drop of charges here and now, Hummel said, adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was "cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband - who has died since - discussed, before rendering his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison - which constitutes a serious lack of procedural.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally said at the end of September that he had “lyed” to the author of the documentary.
In case the court refused to drop the lawsuit, Mr. Hummel demanded that a trial be held, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no drop of charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was handed down, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set foot in the United States since then.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to appear at the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that it is possible to escape?, Ms. Asayama asked.
She said the filmmaker “asked the court for a favor, while contemptuous of its authority.”
One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to make their decision - also stressed that "there are other alternatives to the flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who demanded that the prosecution of Roman Polanski be dropped.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also called for an end to the lawsuit.
Recalling that her client can no longer stand being harassed at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, curbed by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market tumbled between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped to improve market opinion on the strength of the economic recovery,” the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also picked up sharply in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 a month earlier, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
The indices, however, have been slowed down by a further rise in the dollar, the highest in two months against the euro, which "is pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Miss World Election Again in South Africa
After a month-long journey across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the last straight line to fulfill their dream: to be voted the world’s most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
At this great mass of beauty organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was amazing.
I've seen so many things and lived so many experiences!, says Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 p.m. (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and is present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” Miss India said with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a head of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates went on a safari like last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I could get close to.
“I will definitely be back for the 2010 World Cup,” said Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is 'very positive', son David says
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David assured Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father's bedside in hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his departure from the plane that was taking him from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, with a relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was “placed in an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade is in school, to attend a school show, an AFP photographer found.
The head of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday with the singer.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible judicial process to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Hallyday was “departed far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it had me stunned, given that I had two herniated discs myself, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "departed without drain, with nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resolve a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, convicted several times by the court, in medical liability files, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of Order, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfectly successful" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems in brackets.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus.
The UDF association raises the tone and sums the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempted OPA of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, urging him to no longer use it on any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to reclaim the UDF logo, ruling that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his move, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not want to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the minister and the MP, urging them to no longer use the acronym and to pass on ownership of the brand, under penalty of legal proceedings.
In recent days, you have multiplied statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement to “take back” the UDF logo, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to send the name of this movement, the "New Centre", the slogan "Today's UDF", on your militant material and on the front page of your site, as well as the signatories of the letter.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which urges the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) trademark to its legitimate assignees".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they said that the UDF "has been a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recalled that Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironing over the NC’s strategy: “It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled.”
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday decided to try the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the 80-year-old to plunder her part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this saga-worthy case about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear each other apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that medical expertise from 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, saying in particular if Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will tell him about it, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, at the end of the hearing.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
Expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady we need to protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been prosecuting Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-to-all artist, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a longtime friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit brought by Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to large family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
"Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I have never been able to talk to him since his marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was not admissible to take action, especially since a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said the public prosecutor’s representative, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
A managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees recalls the position of companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of adhering employees to "values" determined from above as it used to be, to impose on consumers products thought by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences returns regularly!
Employee demobilization can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That’s why we call for a managerial revolution that would involve putting employees at the centre of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I was able to see that, faced with a new situation, any structure finally arrives, after many detours, to do as a priority... what it has always done.!
- Secondly, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Coming from the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, unsuited to the world today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental observation: for employees, engagement for the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only studies from the motifional analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "on the spot".
They thus create a favourable ground for the concerted development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: 'Just War' Worth Praising Obama Right
The right-wing United States on Friday welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the day before, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who embroidered the award to Mr. Obama on Oct. 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Ms. Palin, the Republican party’s right wing senior, told USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the topic of “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is of course the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found the speech to be really very good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
In some ways, I found this speech entirely historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The ex-elect, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush who was a columnist for the Washington Post, Obama gave “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he has spoken like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "tender, blistered and uninspired" on National Review Online.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When war is enshrined in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained praiseworthy for the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech a “superproduction” even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the newspaper said.
Obama “pronounced the right speech,” the New York Times said, calling it “dark and uplifting.”
Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of negotiations-marathon, the trade unions of the road sector and TLF, the only employers' organization to have remained until the end, reached Friday night an agreement that ends the slogan of strike and the threat weighing on Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "joyed" with this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks the negotiators had left in the early morning on Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text of agreement in the late morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it still took more than six hours from a meeting that began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed by 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was concern that it would disrupt the holiday season," Bussereau said.
The bill foresees a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage workers, "we increase from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're starting from very far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give orders to our activists that there be no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, praised "a good deal", although it was "difficult to concede the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros monthly for the low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs, and the holding of general road transport statuses in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote it "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies that are members of this organization, and secondly, to the whole profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Mr Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP management left them hungry for their request for a premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, at the rate of one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that “RATP is making efforts to serve department stores”.
The RER A crosses from west to is the Parisian metropolitan area.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains traveled during peak hours, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no hustle and bustle on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially due to the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a supervision of agents and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "major" by the unions, of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the ERNs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the ERN A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT was outraged, stressing that the management "was not fucked to solve a problem while in the road hauliers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession," the RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company "mocked at the weekend users".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "for the sake of appeasement".
The conflict threatens to widen at RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the daily million travelers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros premiums, for shifted hours, on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, With Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by protests of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision risks greatly complicating the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) has been dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity from Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of party property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to dry up Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large southeastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots.
A hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen in despair.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, n.d.r.) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party of the Islamist movement, also lamented the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo to the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the clearing and sandblasting service of the roads (FES) says that it is not to bother the citizens.
This is simply so that the agents can test the technique of the vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, this could be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high-traffic streets, main arteries such as the Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road bottom that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours of time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3am "so that the roads are cleared when the daily migration traffic begins".
When it gets more difficult, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the clearing and sandblasting service of the roads tells us "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it doesn't snow anymore, access roads and service roads are taken care of - such as Rat-Beil-Straße.
The sideways and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger is well aware that this always gives rise to some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets out to prioritize clearing the areas deemed dangerous and the passageways.
As for cycle paths, ESF services are generally not able to take care of them.
Mr Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 10 p.m. and 4.30 a.m.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also possible for the police to use this special service in cases of need.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50 meters high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa findae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was at the time part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt began excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says they sometimes found a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
Excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a quite exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all palaeontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he specifies that it confirms certain theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the Saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: theropods (carnivores) that include the tyrannosaur and velociraptor that later appeared and of which descend birds, sauropods, long-necked quadrupeds, and those related to them and herbivores that include the ornithisch species and herbivores.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa was one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting relationship of characteristics both primitive and developed, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found evidence that the Tawa finda had small aerial sacs in its skull bones, just like the birds that are the descendants of the theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa ella, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also possessed aerial sacks and a light frame, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians appeared there.
As a result, the three great evolutionary lines have divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, the whole of the emerged lands that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot be descended from a common ancestor who migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaurus, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
During the Triassic era, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, fostering the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and the Jurassic.
However, such a success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs have survived randomly while other reptiles are reported to have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorable meteorite flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic period and that since then vegetated in the shadows: it was mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from the J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protest students of the Campus Westend.
In a statement in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by the students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art were smeared with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories felt that the degradation did not justify “such a violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organized their own classes”.
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to make the reasons for the mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee has thus shied away from the debates that would, however, be indispensable.
The lecturers demand that the criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not participate in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took the cause for the action initiated by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the site is totally unacceptable, she told the regional parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday in the television program Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Left)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion requiring the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new "Silicon Valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the commune has a reputation as the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
In September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd established links with Riedberg, the Frankfurt Science Centre – with university institutes and companies at the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close cooperation".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs, with a strong focus on scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It houses the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnical Engineering, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be set high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than “the new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burying of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Headline stations, with tracks ending in the city, had a reputation at the time as the relics of 19th-century transport technology that acted as the brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to move locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what needs to be done.
That is why the main railway stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations are no longer really a problem of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and pilot cars at both ends.
However, we are now launching the construction of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have won.
The railway company is the party because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of the computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is detrimental.
The passing station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic of people to which was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of connection and congestion in the network.
The Ministry of Transport lists a total of 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom thoroughly here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine Valley route is on its way to becoming the bottleneck for international goods traffic, right in the heart of Europe.
Government Considers Judgment Concerning Airport
At the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the state government referred to the possibility of appealing the decision of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the ban on night flights.
Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine the ruling of the Administrative Tribunal from a legal point of view, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulations on the prohibition of night flights in the event that the planned construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would take place.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 11pm and 5am, as the state government envisages, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nighttime air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticised the deadline and tried to pressure the government's representative to refer the matter to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which was to ban night flights, otherwise this will be condemned as a total breach of a given word.
It’s damn hard to be allowed to keep your word, Green Party leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the reproaches of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the state government is still trying to authorize night flights using "avocados and robbery".
It takes time to conduct a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "fast first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. Banks Reimbursing Aid
The big U.S. banks, severely affected by the crisis, are breaking away from their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid it received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the payment of higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the amount comes from the bank's coffers, which are well-filled thanks to the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to U.S. taxpayers: the infusion of capital helped considerably to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had presumed its capabilities by buying investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering obtaining money from the financial markets in order to free itself from the oversight of the state.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, CNBC reported, citing banking circles.
The Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment on this information.
In June, the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repayed the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated Election
Eventually, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial board of ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to further harm ZDF steward Markus Schächter in case the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter’s candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for Brender's renewal and 7 others had voted against. Brender's impeachment by vote represented a severe but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority on the Board of Directors, had already indicated several weeks before the vote, not wanting to re-take Brender to his post.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief, citing the fact that the listening rate for ZDF news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
This is the reason why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, punishing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it will have been of no use.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance (Spanish) languages.
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first of all in the "today-journal" news magazine (today's newspaper).
Then his career continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (two-monthly news program presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial department.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's adversary on the Board of Directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Minister-President Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not consider calling for the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF’s supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor, had skilfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should allow the chosen study module to be concluded.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master programmes.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Less reviews
Since the start of student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly put the fashionable expression in their mouths: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module must normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", reads a thirty-page document on the future conditions for admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, it should be possible to stop the slippages, which significantly impaired the studyability.
In the future, "studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies.
The modules as well as the background should be examined carefully to see if one can not avoid this feeling of choking that one sometimes feels in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should “have the opportunity and leeway necessary to enable and foster personal initiative.”
The new regulations will relate to access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put a strain on the agencies so that the programmes were not too heavy and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have given its agreement to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities should organise tutorial programmes and strengthen pedagogical guidance offices as well as examination offices and the International Relations Department.
For this, the Länder and universities plan a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, you will only have to pass one exam to complete your studies.
The organisation of studies should be more flexible, recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the studyability of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see education policy no longer organised "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful to us", she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough, it demands the right and the possibility for each graduate bachelor to enroll in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder ensure that today's Bachelor students have sufficient places for Master's studies and as good study conditions as possible tomorrow.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of simplifying access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later a collection director in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Artist's House in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about himself in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Enlistment trials had insidiously begun in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able to withstand the intimidation attempts of the Securitate sufficiently."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honour for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary entanglements with the mechanisms of dictatorship power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors originating from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowliness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
One can assume that the victims have made speculations and sometimes guessed which real names last hid the borrowing names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and hampered in the past few years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the restitution of the files has been slow since.
Since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar, who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful manner towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inescapable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
The judicious reaction of the listeners, to Söllner's admission, gives hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received yesterday the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Uprising in the Champions League
There was the impression that a four-pin representative was arriving, drawn straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread its goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier in hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because that's when it was going to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just committed three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final well", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
The "big work" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is a question of repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three speedy goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Sweepstakes
The eighth final of the Champions League (match going 16./17. + 23./24 February / return game 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor taking office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the lucky man, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "pumpman of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer made any effects with the healer Babbel.
Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, said: “In football when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that we never thought were possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" seen by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "This is someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, manager Horst Heldt warned
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had a bad revival four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We have not yet crossed the difficult course.
The fact that Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to party, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the weekend events that a televised interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would thwart, in response to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused management of style weakness and said it had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after games had been removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, announcing consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer in danger of becoming friends for life these two forties.
In any cast, they agreed with everything else, that is, without the group's prior work by the coach replaced, strong sporting and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “largely successful,” Heldt and Lehmann responded in chorus – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked verbally and gestically world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
By unanimous agreement of the judges, he prevailed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points victory in the uniminity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has honorably defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had twice won the title of World Champion of WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he didn't make the long-awaited knockout.
Klitschko, who came out 39 times as a winner in 41 professional fights, has twice confessed to his loss due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko to bring into play his dangerous right-wing.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko by calling him a "vile zombie" who "is not really capable."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he can see his eyes.”
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth match since his comeback on 11 October 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, defending his title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and I'm in perfect shape," Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It appears that his promotional company is planning to play this game now at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: Jürgen Trittin, the leader of the Green parliamentary group, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and La Gauche (the Left) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 8 pm).
In other words, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was actually not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Kunduz military commander.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak as soon as possible before the federal parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the view that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the Chancellery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesperson categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellery has in no way influenced military interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices grew louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the removal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had given Guttenberg about the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some inconvenient details from the Minister.
The entourage of the two senior officials, however, suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert has in the meantime asked in a letter for a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the department declined to comment on the allegations and referred the matter to the Federal Parliament Committee of Inquiry, which was to be set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge unhindered in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, he who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes pushes the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best case it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect are different, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitter substances in the brain – first and foremost dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine – breaks down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of waking dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's the fall of 2001 when Henning T becomes a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with creepy colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hovers at the bottom of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him winged devil creatures, grinning, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over his body.
Toning, nasty voices, howling, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo, makes it a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and runs the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let this serve as a lesson for you, the voices in a choir cry out to tear out his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and have yourself healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitation, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike dreams, Fuchs says, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why our brains do these kinds of cabriolets is still an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to momentarily lose their perception of reality, Fuchs said.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the neuronal system anomaly occurs and the fact that it does not manifest for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena for the past ten years: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, love sorrows or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to high school.
A girl doing everything normal, really.
If there weren’t images and voices.
During recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, speaks to him.
When she answers, her classmates look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think that this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive his presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man nice.
Am I crazy? she sometimes wonders.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, it happens that she cannot take the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations on the board.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grinning faces or the girl with bloody notches on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she cries out to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She got her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she came into contact via the internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the chances are high that they will have hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., an only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was of age to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dreaming and hallucinating.
In our world that is too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease that also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of the modification of consciousness awakened by the dream.
The dream-like experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot distinguish from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that damages his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dreaming and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in a situation that is itself intolerable, a capacity for organization that is given to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changing the Heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, at the time his conscious departs for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from scratch, visiting foreign places, traveling back in time . He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcyclist who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He completely absorbs himself into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, dream delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even when awake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of Burda Publishing is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to joining the society, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of Chairman and CEO as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first and foremost responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the treasury sector i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 respectively, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to connect the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda specifies that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families who have let themselves be carried away by a bulimia of capital, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of tutor of the country as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have set El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeder, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (warming and stretching included) is enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having worked our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, luminosity or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied décolletés
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we have to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, equip themselves with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE".
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will put in place agreements on mobility, by carrying out approaches, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in establishing the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to start the implementation of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, envisions "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without an Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our major production sites,” said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), dedicated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with Autonomous Communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “severe increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Salon of Collectible Cars, a meeting place for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can you find motorcycles and collectible cars, but you will also find items of all kinds related to the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, in the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collection engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Participating companies include, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and catering, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Competence tests with collectible automobiles and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda wants to prove that the sporting spirit is not upset with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has achieved as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the roominess, the behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasing.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which they all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough living space to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large chest with regular shapes is added.
The automatic engine shut-off and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine with manual six-speed changeover.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most in-demand Mazda3 models are diesel models, those that do not drive a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words the one that has the largest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) which suppresses the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17's wheels are notable.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It stands out in particular by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this important sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a great deal of satisfaction.
"Premiere" of luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to watch his email, without offering the possibility to even see certain types of attachments or to browse the Internet.
It took advantage of its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what the iPhone’s data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but comes with a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately search for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it has been expected to work for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small prints.
The European Commission’s repeated reminders to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of their country of origin, we are hesitant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have WiFi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals allowing them to profit from their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
Without subscription and without gallantry.
It is a connected device and you pay when you buy it, not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with lifelong access as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I want it simply because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Favorite Color
Yellow is arguably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama as president of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, she chose, in fact, the same to accompany him in the second moment, undoubtedly, the most important of his life: the presentation in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on both occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards green with shiny reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabrics, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to hand over the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the job, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green mid-heeled shoes for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while she wore it the previous time.
75% of working mothers had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger generation women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fertility and professional career of women in Spain", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of employment occupied.
Those who have no activity outside the home, work part-time or have a poorly stable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are repelling entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job have their first child, on average 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to delay the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the date of beginning of common life, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap between the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35- to 49-year-old group, those who completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another disctinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle-level or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand's products, chanting the universal motto "Because I'm worth it well".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered with L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, designers and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's Ace Poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reads and rereads.
I leave you here some snapshots.
In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one I felt without naming it: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjugated the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven by the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north side, on which the best mountaineers still let go and always caught."
About William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and at other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline : <0xC2><0xAB> This writer collected the insane cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in its literary form, and he did it in flight from himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent discourse to the asticots. »
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘Beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved the worms of Spenser: "Sleep after the effort, / after the storm the port, / rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights."
About Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she was also carrying her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she should tell him that Edward VII spied on her among the Azalea or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: <0xC2><0xAB> What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do if it was not to try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if he doesn't want Faulkner to shoot Baroja?
What did it do but to aspire to the glory of this man to serve as his pedestal?”
A Cowardly Aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed next to her and our dog, a bloodied, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see how amusing it is to attack for free a little defenseless animal that, moreover, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumene attacking an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog moaned all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the local police station, even though we doubt that it serves much and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with young people so they find it fun to abuse for free a defenseless animal that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing the helmet
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet wear, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets, as this is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and said it contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of the two-wheeled helmet, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the benchmark for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add up all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (derived from passenger cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic conditions.
In view of this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, the 2000E purchase aids have been of little use.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Dealership Association anticipates a year 2010 similar to the one ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As has been the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a grace period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The Emergency Brake Assist works by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the help, in revenge, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four disasters involving injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he will need more time to complete the rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
At GM, on the other hand, a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by Russian group Converg, is gaining in importance.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest precious jewel, Porsche engineers departed the Boxster S and managed to thin it by nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual slatted roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, five kilos, to reduce the light gas tank with 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos gained, to mount 19 kilos of tires, and sports bags.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on California’s secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as impeccable.
The reduction in weight does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: we hadn’t tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which at the same time guarantees as much safety in corners, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at low speeds for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
That's what we wanted. Thanks to its steering, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel say.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of motor at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The accelerating capacity is brutal, whether it’s during downtime or recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road surface we covered with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car handled the nests well.
The electronic assistants barely noticed being present throughout the journey, while on some turns we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light car, one of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
A close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house’s parades, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "bad girl" or a "it girl," she's a "bag girl."
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a resounding triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the arduous field of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is thus placed at the top of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although they had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of Vitoria's team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main builders of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to be noticed as the best player of his team, with 13 points, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already suggested that this night was not going to be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that we do not win so easily on their pitch, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows gaining the advantage over the luminous ones (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed a few skillful actions to catch the air, and it was at this point that appeared the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic who, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas put the counter back to a reassuring quarter-score (54-67), reassuring the quarter-score (54-67).
Avala's team went out to play all for the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory was missing in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion or by the size of the rival, arguably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis' indoor play, allowed them to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fighting, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing their superiority in both sides, as the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal fouls weighed heavily on Unicaja.
The insiders and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Rise
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to shake.
The Unicaja were trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible because the Olympiacos were relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate listings, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates the salaries of users from more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For the past week, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels badly paid,” Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 euros gross per year in England, 25,751 euros gross per year in France and 16,420 euros gross per year in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid work in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11 592 euros per year, followed by that of a seller, with 14 725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15 667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are that of a driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires de la embassy of Brazil in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination.”
The channel also cited the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile imposed on him by the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant mark in the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been practically finalised and, without questioning their non-compliant liquidity policy, are starting to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their tendering next week.
Therefore, investors are questioning the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads are rising again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is once again affected.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad for silenceing the advocates of moral hazard, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those in charge of global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of credit limitation on job destruction, when what would have to be done is decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, the situation in Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of transitional risk premium normalisation, after some excesses in high positions, this would be foreseeable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt gaps increase in line with European corporate bonds, we need not worry.
If the European gaps were to decrease and ours to continue to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote: when our forecast indicators force most research services to anticipate their stimulus models and revise their forecasts for 2011 upwards, with the OECD and the European Commission returning to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not promise much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “caution is a mother of security”.
Connected sectors
Iberdrola's president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, eight-closes.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million by 2020 and an additional €60,000 million between that date and 2030, in the event that the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment would not be 60 000 million but 95 000 million.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the question changes, and power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the government's recently approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company demands, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "point measures", as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in 10 airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a five-year term.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona races its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The project at stake is a tunnel estimated at AU$1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway dealership.
The city council wants to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing Public/Private Collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to AU$1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million) and in the final phase three consortiums compete, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in smooth, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is divided between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction projects and privatizations, but entering it is a major difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just taken a place in this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, in which it already has a wide presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link (Northern Link), is expected to connect the Toowong Western Highway to the Kelvin Grove Ringway (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open for traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million ($308 million) for funding.
Brisbane is already offering work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make substantial gains from Hochtief, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company, owned by ACS, will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fibre-optic broadband network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has sold the project to build the 27-story King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million euros
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, amounting to €64.5 million.
The company was awarded this contract a few days after it was entrusted with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that submitted to the Renfe-organized call for tenders, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom receives $63 million fine to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise, accumulates more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore recidivist.
An application store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed in the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought in 476.4 million at Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won $467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, have billed the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money raised by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for allocating money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will allocate €413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (among which Atlético de Madrid) received €2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and tie (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth finals receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least $7.1 million, and a maximum of $31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four assigned places.
The previous year's champion took in 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third, and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group has listed details of the offer to buy shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a Public Offering of Acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa’s offer therefore values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders 15 days to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV stated that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the judicial back-and-forth of her former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jordá as internal audit director.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group chairman.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to the companies of the Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further embezzlements of funds cannot be ruled out.
Concerning the credit to the Salazars, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Hearing that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV approves Paternina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized the transaction because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted "sufficient" following the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed, and that they could in no way be transferred before the completion of the offer, of which it indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex task.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Disaster assessment and maintenance service and solution providers are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years, more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because you have to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process proceeds very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million annually to build these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing broken parts or calculating the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
With the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of what kind of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
The company offers ten different tools, with the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims assessment solution for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of assessments, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious claims for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it generated a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it undertook its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
Solera Group’s global revenues (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock market for $1,000 million; today, its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Crashed Cars
In October, Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breaks and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collective cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage quote in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, then he can print the quote to hand it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be subject to a credit.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see very well, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
